[Verse 1:]
Yea yea uh huh
She said F**K FENDI, but I think she was playin
I heard she move dem thangs
I think she f**kin Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, dat mean she give him brain
She trynna be like Lil Kim, her picture luks da same
Y she ain't signed with G-Unit, she frum Queens rite?
And wats her nationality, she chinese rite?
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT
She ain't da next bitch, tell dat bitch FALL BAC!
See I'm a hata, I go hard... listen let's begin
U kno her last name Minaj, she a lesbian
And she ain't neva comin out, luk at currency
But every time she do a interview u kno I run 2 c
She get me so sick it make me vomit
Dats y I spend my time online leaving comments
And u kno dat I got sum more haters with me
Mite hit up thisis50... MTV... hit up BET
Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki

[Chorus: x2]
Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I mite crack a smile
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!
One day u'll remeber dis
One day wen we reminese
Nuthin I do ever is, gud enuff 4 da music biz

For u, for u

[Verse 2:]
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
U c a bad bitch gettin shine, u shud luv it
Cause everytime a door opens 4 me dat means u
Jus gotta a betta opportunity 2 do u
Dey don't understand dese labels luk at numbas is statistics
I lose, u lose, mines jus legastic
Ne way, real bitches listen wen I'm speakin
Cause if nicki win, den all of ya'll gettin meetns (kyea)
Ask LA Reid, ask Jay
Den hit up Universal, see wat Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Common, u can ask chris
Ladi wen your done, jus da luda bad bitch
Onli underground bitch around deres nuthin 2 paparatzi
In & outta town, be swirvin da mazeratzi
Stay around da white like a nazi
Pussy pppoppin on my poppers so da cops c... BITCHES!

[Chorus: x2]
Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I mite crack a smile
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!
One day u'll remeber dis
One day wen we reminese
Nuthin I do ever is, gud enuff 4 da music biz
