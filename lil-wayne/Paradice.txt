Mula Baby…


She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame
She would do anything she could to feel the flame
When everybody knew your mood and the games you played
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed

Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Yeah…
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice


He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame uhh
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain ahh
When everybody know your moves, they speaking your name ohh
All over the late night local news I heard them scream


Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice

Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice

Wooo
I say the sun don’t shine forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
And everything that glitter ain’t gold uahhh
Oooo
I say love don’t love forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
When everything that’s new gets old uahhh

Sometimes we try to find a road to the richness
Need roadside assistants
Blisters on my knees, from begging for forgiveness
Ain’t no dollars on my trees but mileage on my feet
‘Cause I been climbing to the peak, and running from the bullshit
I’m tired of hearing the same song, who told the DJ bring it back
Dead Presidents bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat
Staring at BIG poster, I swear that he be winking back
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I’m just thinking back
Ca-call me crazy, I’ve been called worse
It’s like I have it all, but what’s it all worth? haha
I’m probably better in my afterlife
I should cherish life, but this ain’t paradice

Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh no, this ain’t paradice
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh
This ain’t paradice
No, this ain’t paradice
This ain’t paradice ayy
