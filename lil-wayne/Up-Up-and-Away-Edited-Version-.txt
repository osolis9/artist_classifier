Up Up And Away
Up Up And Away
Up Up And Away

I'm about to go up up and away
Dick in your mouth
Fuck what you say
You sweet as pie a muffin and cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fucking her face shit
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Ya high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you should keep in the gate
Pussy, hm, how sweet is the taste?
Gun to ya head, what ya peep gonna say
Weezy bitch, I'm deep in the space
Floating away like a leaf in the lake
I'm gone like delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit, if a bitch is bad
I'm a call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Hm, what they talking about
I go hard they soft as a couch
I'm running them in and walking them out
Cars so cold I park in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money talk, Lisa Leslie, YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Running up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking she can exit

Gun tucked in the waist
I buss in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say
But up up and away

Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

Weezy, where ya going? Up
You're going a little bit too far
(Haha)

Ain't this a bitch, I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill yo ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even twitch ya lip
40 cal with the extended clip
Ain't gon be no incident
Skinny jeans, red vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house so I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wylin out, then were riding out, now your hiding out, honeycombe
I'm laughing to the bank like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good
I'm on pills smoking that
Eyes so high I look blind
But athe stove on my waist cook fine
I be a nigga that took lives?
A nigga that'll take it outside
A nigga that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape the housewives
I'm gon get so wasted they gon have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit, these rappers are just hostages
Let's cut to the chase
My bitch know I glide and glace?
But I ain't got nothing to say
But up up and away

Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

Weezy, where ya going?
You're going a little bit too far

Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away

Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps on deck so fuck that nigga
Leave you looking like lightening struck that nigga
Stacks on deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm calling my bitch the shit
Walking 'round on my fucking shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm superbad
I don't give a hoover damn
My I son all these niggas, they should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit yo 5 dollar ass down, 'fore I make change
I'm pumping ya brakes
I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say
But up up and away

Weezy, where ya going?
You're going a little bit too far

Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
