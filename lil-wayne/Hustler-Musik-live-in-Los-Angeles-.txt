See you fucking with the boys who tote toys way before Christmas
No assistance just, that persistence with
That commitment if, I don’t get it somebody gonna die tonight
I know my vibe is tight and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain’t right, then let me die in his arms
See I’ll be riding, just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kidding
How the hell you ain’t here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king
Shall be
So I be who I be

Baby you gotta know that I’m just out here doing what I gotta do
For me and you and we eating, so bitch
How the fuck is you tripping?
I’m taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge if the money don’t move
And I won’t budge
Won’t budge
No I won’t budge no
Lord

Money is the motivation
Facing the avenue
Back touchin’ the wall
Got the weed
Got the gun
Gotta run wen I hear that bird call (bbrrr bbrrr) dang
Hop in that thing and merk off
Swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior
Anybody murderer
If Birdman sponsor it
Phantom of the Opera
All black, clock tent, locked in
I can let them shots out
You can’t get no shots in
Bullet proof
Leave a nigga with a bullet roof
Shoot you in your mouth Leroy, they call him bullet tooth
I’m like what it do
What it do
There’s a full court
Pressure I’m just going for the two
If I’m open for the three
I’mma take it in a second
Even if there’s one second
I’mma make it, it’s nothing
I don’t take it for granted
I don’t take it for nothing
I take it for what it is worth to the durf motherfucker
Yeah

Baby you gotta know that I’m just out here doing what I gotta do
For me and you and we eating, so bitch

My fingers to the judge if the money don’t move
And I won’t budge
Won’t budge

Lord

I ain’t never killed nobody I promise
And I promise if you try me
You gonna have to rewind this track and make me go back
That thing’ll go bllapp
That boy will lay flat, so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got Nina in my palm and I’m masturbating
Black Peter Pan flies ’til I die what you saying
Baden ape, Yves Saint, Evisu what I stand
Got me feelin’ like Scarface, like the Koheba
Streets reply I look right in the four seater
You know I be out here riding the four seater
Top floor of the for Seasons, four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up
See it’s a cold world so homie bundle up
We ain’t on this grind for nothing
Now get you hustle up

Baby you gotta know that I’m just out here doing what I gotta do
For me and you and we eating, so bitch
How the fuck is you tripping?
I’m taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge if the money don’t move
And I won’t budge
Won’t budge
No I won’t budge no
Lord
