[Chorus: ~Lil Wayne~]
Ok, pop that p-ssy and shake that ass,
Pop that p-ssy and shake that ass,
I say pop that p-ssy and shake that ass,
Pop that p-ssy and shake that ass,
You got to pop that p-ssy and shake that ass,
Pop that p-ssy and shake that ass
And no ceilings
And no ceilings
And no ceilings
Yeah,

Ok,
Pockets on he-man,
I get it if I demand,
Man I do it big, to me you n-ggas wee man,
Bout to go pecans, I beat it like 3 hands,
Weezy in the building you other n-ggas freelance,
I don't give a f-zzuck,
I done got my sh-t up,
I gotta do a bit, that's push ups, sit ups,
F-ck with young money b-tch n-gga get hit up,
N-gga f-ck pay even f-ck wid us,
I'm a eastside n-gga yeah eastside n-gga,
Where the muthaf-cking beef gets deep fried n-gga,
N-gga could'ntsee me with 3 eyes n-gga,
You's a b-tch,
No U-N-I-T-Y n-gga
On the mic I'm like pac, I'm like B-I n-gga,
Whoever don't agree come and see my n-gga,
I be waiting in my mansion seaside n-gga,
Young muthaf-cking M-O-N-E-Y...

{Singing:}
Hate no, hate no
I don't wanna hate no, hate no,
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
I don't wanna hate nobody tonight,
I don't wanna hate nobody tonight,
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
Everyday pushing me, pushing me

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Lil Wayne:]
Ok, Cool n Dre,
This is no ceilings,
I do this all day I got bars, no railings,
Looking for a b-tch for some sexual healing,
Open up her mouth and she catch it like Braylon,
Young Weezy F, the F is not for failing,
Swagger just dumb call it Sarah Palin,
If you n-ggas fly then I must be para-sailing,
We are not the same, I'm a muthaf-cking alien,

[Birdman:]
Back on my saddle with the tool and my hand
Uptown real n-gga b-tch landed in the sand,
Back home n-gga did it for the land
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand
High life, give a f-ck about your stripes homey,
Killer kill, kill a spend your... daily homie,
Turn left get your switch turned of n-gga,
Turn right and get your sh-t took off n-gga,
F-ck cause we higher than we ever been,
More loaded, white doves, burning hundreds,
Overseas n-gga pitching on the top floor,
High floor situation from the bottom floor,
Born in the middle, shining like a diamond,
Red diamonds, big diamonds how we roll n-gga,
24's f-cking all these hoes n-gga,
High life getting money then we go n-gga,

Like father like son boy...
