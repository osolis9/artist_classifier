No Ceilings, motherfucker
Alright, alright

Nice tires on the 'ghini, you should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable zukini
I live on the beach, she walk around in her bikini
Girls are like a school and cut 'em like seniors

I'm here to distinguish the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap, get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like fenas
This beat getting' totaled, Pam, Keisha, Kema

Sittin' on the world, thinkin' 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side, paint you like mural
Dig in my pocket, pulled out the party
Be cool before you get stumped and pulled out the party

Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Lookin' for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church like a choir and a couple of old priests

Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors
I'm not expectin' you to have one inside yours
Vince Young, suicide doors
Life's a bitch, now die for her

I have the type of flow, niggas don't have to like
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don't have to write
The way I'm eating, niggas wish they had my appetite
Straight up out of Texas and I'm major like apple white

I pull four then I hit the exit door
Take a trip to Macy's, cop the whole second floor
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pours
Yeah, my pockets full of dead people like a morgue bore

I made it from a flyer to the Forbes
Young Elvis freshly, yes he flyer than the store
Dropping babies out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat
Got your son, looking up to me like I'm 6 feet

Your daughter need someone to save her, not me
I knocking hoes down like Laila Ali
Try he and I'ma put the toaster to your kidney
Then I pull off in a Bentley, top open like a chimney

It's no ceilings like a coliseum
Candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhea
The way I'm leaning, I'm annoyed if I stand still
Flow harder than an anvil, short

Okay, it's Gudda hoe, all about my bills like buffalo
Your bitch under my sheets, I heard she was an undercover hoe
Purple got me moving slow like I'm in a snail race
Pop, pop, pop 3 shots to the head then I pick up my shell case

Leave 'em with a pale face, yes, I am a Young Money goon
Your girl like a motion picture, she be coming soon
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to mills then drop her off the tune

Couple screws lose, y'all wanna play with him?
This is No Ceilings, bitch, ruthless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us in your club, well, nigga pay us then

All gray BM, I'm getting from my baby M
She told us get the money and count it for me when I rake it in
Don't play no games hoe, you know my name hoe
G-U-D-D-A, propane flow
