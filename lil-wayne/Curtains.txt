I ain't nervous
I swear to god I ain't nervous
Naw, naw
And I'm laughin at them pussy niggas, and that pussy shit they doin
Gettin' cake like I'm Jewish
My nigga Drake he Jewish
I swear to god I ain't nervous naw
Ok I swear to god I ain't nervous 
I swear to god I ain't nervous
I say I swear to god I ain't nervous 
I got her workin', twerkin', and slurpin my serpent 
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turning up with your turn up ain't working
Just want some mouth and lip service, yeah
I'm gettin head behind the Maybach, curtains
Ok I'm straight edge, no ricochet 
That pussy boneless, that chick-fil-a
I fuck with real riders, and they tickets paid
Niggas crying wolf, while I wipe them tears away
I swear my momma trust my work, so I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free that what it costs for you to get merked
Have my pants saggin like fuck it
I'm still on my business, spent my birthday in jail
I was making bad decisions, saw my enemy at the light
I told Marley light the weed
Then I lit them niggas up before that motherfucker turn green
Your bitch ride me like a go cart
I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts and them after that they worthless
I swear to god I ain't nervous
I said I swear to god I ain't nervous
I don't know I swear to god I ain't nervous
And that pussy don't get purchased, hoe
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turnin up but your turn up ain't workin
I like me long hair and curvy 
If niggas think it's a game I leave their brains on their jerseys
She said she love me that's the molly talkin'
Her pussy so wet, it keep sliding off it
She got a nigga, but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangsta, he the remix
Girl do you use that same mouth to kiss your mama?
I say only god can judge me, fuck you honor
Yeah her birthday suit is her pajamas
She said I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I punch her man in his eye give him a shiner
I blind him, him and whoever
Cosigned him
I get at him like Yolanda
Young Money, Cash Money, Obama
It's fuck the world no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And the pistol came with a silence, but I swear to god he heard it
I said I swear to god I aint nervous
Nah I swear to god I ain't nervous
Bitch I'm the god I should be rappin in a turban 
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turnin up, but your turn up ain't workin
Baby I do on some out and some lip service
She gonna ride this dick like Kentucky, Derby

[Verse 3: Boo]
On that Pat-ron, I'm swerving
Game tight like virgins
I gotta bad bitch, she Persian
Call her AK when she's squirting
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, yo bitch got a place to sit
Yea, I'm wilding off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie, wanna hold hands then watch movies
I be goddamned, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talking- lets get to it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurping, my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up a missing person
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm getting head behind the Maybach curtains
Ya
