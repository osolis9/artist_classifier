Uh, umm, Weezy y'all
Young Money, Cash Money
This is DA Drought 3
Ladies and gentlemen, you know me

Listen, you know I ride for my motherfunkin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'ma hustler and I'd rather make a killin'

My eyes is so wide as he watchin' the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck ya hospital, Young Money, we the illest

And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty like CY Phyllis
Self made G and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap but in the kitchen I'm a chemist

And when I was 5, my favorite movie was the gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and the little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission

I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing

And you know that I'ma ride with my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit

And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
'Coz the sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you see that I'm goin' be in it
The sky is the limit

Buck Ten in the coupe and your bitch love it
Switching lane faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free

And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
'Coz I'm the type to let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea

The only thing on a mind of a shark is eat by any means
And you're just sardines
I got the 40 cal tuck in my P.R.Ps
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans

And majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours

And I'ma ride with my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit

And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm goin' be in it
'Coz the sky is the limit

And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off ya shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone
That's sitting on the living room sofa
(That's fucked up, haha)

And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off ya shoulder
Mail it to your mom wit a dozen of roses
(Now that's fucked up)

And I'm a G
And you ain't gotta know the alphabets to see
I know that my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I could never forget the streets

So, you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfuckin' niggas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigga
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit, yeah, the sky is the limit
And If you look high, you'll see that I'm goin' be in it
'Coz the sky is the limit

They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell em I'ma hustler and I'd rather make a killin'
'Coz the sky is the limit
Hands up in the air because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there?
The sky is the limit, the sky is the limit
