It was the summer of 2001
And I saw the whole fuckin' thing
Wait can I say fuck on TV huh fuck it
They had on some squad shit

IT was Lil'' Wayne two adults six children one fluffy puppy
And a Dyke not that kinda dyke, Dick Van Dyke
Hey can I send some shotouts to my people man
Hello, um hey dad

I'm on TV
Well, like I told them guys they gotta
Get off the corner
