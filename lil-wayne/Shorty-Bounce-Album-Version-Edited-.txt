Tear a whole square out ya chest with the shotgun
Make a whole pair out one nigga with the shotgun
We can go there my nigga I'm so there
Rockin by myself with the chopper on the backseat
Shoot at the driver side knock his body to the backseat

Shotty on my back got me walkin like a camel
Put a hump in ya back and lift you up
I'm Weezy F. Baby
Gettin so tough
Stop
Pause
