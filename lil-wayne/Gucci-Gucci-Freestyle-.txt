“One big room full of bad b*tches”

 [Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
 Fu got the weed, Marl got the gun
 They say numbers don’t lie
 B*tch, I’m not the one
 Hammers in ya face, this is not a dream
 And you get in every page in this magazine
 Bumping UGK, talking about a murder
 We roll a Dr. Jay and then we light that Julius Erving
 I got pussy on the way and pussy on the way out
 Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
 Tunechi, Tunechi, toaster, tooly
 F*ck around and pop ya
 My homies got that white girl
 Call it Lady Gaga
 Glock for Tini, nina colada
 Suck, swallow, semen, saliva
 I’m going at your collar
 F*ck you hoe n*ggas!
 Weezy go hard, you b*tches go figure
 Diamonds in my teeth like I’m a f*cking dope dealer
 You’re a dead man walking: Michael Jackson Thriller
 I’m in one big room, full of bad b*tches..

 (I’m in one big room, full of bad b*tches)

 It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi
 Toaster, tooly, f*ck around and pop ya
 My homies got that white girl
 Call it Lady Gaga
 It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi
 Toaster, tooly, f*ck around and pop ya

 [Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
 Back where I started on my set, in black
 All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque
 We don’t pack extra clips, we pack extra Gats
 And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats
 Til the wheels fall off: I can fix a flat
 If you’re scared go to church and get a scripture tat
 Guns the size of children, now don’t be childish
 Be with wild-ass n*ggas and I am the wildest.
 I’m a motherf*cker, call me Weezy baby
 And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato
 My life is a movie, I got a leading lady
 My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady
 I got the world in my hands, skateboard n’ my vans
 And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran
 I know what I can do, so b*tch I do what I can
 Drop the Sorry 4 the Wait, man
 I’m just saying..
 I’m in one big room, full of bad b*tches, yeah

 “One big room full of bad b*tches”

 Tunechi baby!
