Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote
It's got that nice groove that everybody dancin' to
And when I play it, it kind of remind me of me and you
I mean, it's it's one more thing I wanna talk about

Now look it's it's it's time now for you to come home now
Look everybody got there problems
I'm dealin' with mine, I I I done gave up my narcotic
I'm a changed man

Yo, how many ways can I say I'm done fishin'?
You wanted the role, smashed the audition
Havin' a partner for a man in my position
Eliminates the cooks in the kitchen

Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women
And some say it's the life I was given
I say it don't matter if I work at Mickey D's
I still got a fix for what you got between your knees

On a new broad, you still one to one
Every once and again I like havin' some fun
No disrespect intended but what's done is done
Women steppin' out for love, men do it to cum

Not a player like Pun but when shorty's get to grabbin' on me
The last thought I get is, Poobie run
To them girls wishin' all the starters will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is, hon one

She say, she love me, won't leave me, won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin my heart

Yeah, she say, she love me, won't leave me, won't never let me go
But if you think 'bout leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin my heart

We was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens
Every mornin' and every evenin'
Ten years later, she eatin' that Lean Cuisine
I'm on the field, straight brawn off that Creatine

In the NFL, which mean Not For Long
City to city, all the groupies they hop along
Word get back, the wifey she like, stop the song
I'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone, whoa

Momma was like, Baby now, I hate to see your tears
But I been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheatin'
But I ain't never had to wear no black eyes from beatings

As long as he doin' right by you and the kids
How you gon' expect that man not to be who he is
I ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price
'Cause a woman's life is love, a man's love is life

And he gon' live it to the fullest
And I ain't tryin' pull you down or sound like a broken record
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs
Better to have a rich Pit than a broke German Shepard

She say, she love me, won't leave me, won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin my heart

She say, she love me, won't leave me, won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin my heart

Word up, I say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you
Like Sade, you got the 'Sweetest Taboo'
And my game is skin deep like the first tattoo
I gets all in your head just like shampoo

I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like the Texas Ranger

And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
Yeah, you gotta hold your soldier down
Even when the war is lookin' like it is right around the corner

And you don't wanna leave me, believe me
'Cause I can turn you on like a personal TV
It's Young Weezy, I know what you thought
But I'm just here to play my part so don't go breakin my heart

Yeah, she say, she love me, won't leave me, won't never let me go
But if you think 'bout leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin my heart

She say, she love me, won't leave me, won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin' you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin' don't go breakin my heart
