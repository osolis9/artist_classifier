Yea yea yea it's the Carter motherfucker I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker I came back around
It's the Carter motherfucker
Let me show you my building man, it's the Carter
I'ma show y'all the ins the outs the ups the down
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout this is me fourth solo album baby
I came back around, by myself this time, back off the wall
Guns up in the air in the middle of the streets like blak blak blak Welcome

This is the Carter y'all welcome, hard as Malcolm
Dawg is a Vulcan Lord help him, hard as Malcolm
Dawg is a Vulcan Lord help him, hard as Malcolm
Dawg is a Vulcan Lord help him, but y'all felt him
That make you a part of me and pardony, if a part of me
Is what you wanna be what you oughtta be
Don't worry Carter me I just actin' accordingly
I give orders to the commander in chief

Just the commander in me handlin' streets in the Mandarin V
I hear you haters slanderin' me I just hand him the P
I hear you haters slanderin' me I just hand him the P
I hear you haters slanderin' me I just hand him the P
Any drama I pace it like Indiana, I take your grandma
Pacemaker and just handle the piece
Not two fingers I simultaneously 'bout two bangers
You do not want anger USDA prime beef, ya dead meat

I'm so ahead of these trendy rappers speed up
I'm already hot when another one startin' to heat up
Got Mannie hot wit me 'cuz I always beat his beat up
Y'all cats wit y'all feet up startin' to look like feet up, I'm G'd up
On the V'd up, in the truck I gotta put my seat up
In the trunk I got my bass and I ain't speakin' 'bout no speakers
What's leakin' up out of yo speaker is the speech of Wheezy F. baby
No more no less baby, so forth and so on

Front door livin' room young nigga switchin' we
What you need, front door livin' room young nigga switchin' we
What you need, get you crack get you weed
Make your way to the back look ahead and see
White bitch in the bathroom givin' head for speed
But don't you turn your head at me, the president been doin' it
Daddy tried to ruin it but I built this building from the ruts
I own all the corners and the cuts in this motherfucker

And the feds know just what's in this motherfucker
Made niggaz so they can't bust in this motherfucker
So with that lets keep it movin', on to the kitchen
Where my witches keep it brewin', look at how my bitches do it
Bucky buck naked look at all my bitches booties
They handle all my pharmaceutics
I got it from promethazane to metamucil
I'm crucial don't mean to spook you

But this is new Orleans so my queens do voodoo, you know
So the things just move through
I feel your pain I got things to soothe you
That fills the cane so Wayne the neutral
Don't hate the game, hate the institution
That fills the cane so Wayne the neutral
Don't hate the game, hate the institution, fucker

I came back around, it's the Carter
Show you the rest of the house later
We gon' go upstairs, you know
You know what this is right
The Carter
