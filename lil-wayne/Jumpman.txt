[Intro]
T!
Where Hoody at?
No Ceilings, uh

[Verse 1]
One Xan, one Xan, one Xan; Lord I'm tryna cut back
Hol' up, hol' up, where my cup at?
My bitch bout that comeback
Real one from the jump, man, I'm killing the Jumpman
I ain't got no ceilings, no need to look up, man
AK, AK, AK, street-sweeper, no dustpan
Been a stuntman since a young man
Extra gun if one jam
Stuntman since a young man
Extra gun if one jam
On my Carter 5 shit; this one for the thumb, man
Yeah, this one for the duff-bag
Yeah, this for where I'm from at, yeah
My goons break in your house like BruhMan
Yeah; click-clack!
Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam
Gun-Blam, Gun-Blam!
Shh... silence on the gun, I go Silence of the Lamb
Ooh I'm up man, up man
Them Viagras got me up, man
And we pull up, man; up and dump and dump and dump
Then scrrram - screech
The harder I fall, the farther I reach
The water might fall, but life is a beach
When my number’s called, I get out my seat
When my niggas ball, I give em my speech
You might hit a wall, or end up like me
You might have to crawl, but get up like me
And you bite before bark, never I before we
And you pray before eating
You lay with your heat
And you stay with your heat
And you lay on your mink
Bitches lay at your feet
And you play with your kids
You don’t play with these niggas
Don’t play in these streets
I don’t play on these beats
I don’t play bout my money
You heard what I say; no replay, no repeat
Don’t be playing with me
Don’t be playing with we
I don’t play with no Wii
I’m OK, I’m OG
I’m OG on these beats
I OD on these beats
I'm M-O-B-B-B-B on these streets
Say what you say, you don’t be on these streets
'Cuz if we see you it’s on S-I-G-H-T
Belie'e that
Tunechi

[Verse 2]
One Xan, one Xan, one Xan; all I need is one Xan
Knock me out like punch bag
Got me slump like humpback (gone)
Muddy-muddy-muddy, I just drunk a mud bath
Muddy-muddy-muddy, I need me some mud flaps (sippin)
Real one from the jump, man
Real one from the jump, man
On my Carter 5 shit; this one for the thumb, man
Money long, I got that money tall like Kazam
I just popped a combo, ain’t talkin' McDonald’s (medicine)
I just popped a bottle, ain’t talkin' no liquor (medicine)
I’m talking Actavis, I’m talking to the sippers (pour up)
I’m talkin to a stripper, she gon let me pimp her
You talkin to the police, so that’s who you tippin?
Ohhh, that’s a no-no, that’s a no-no, ohhh
Had coke since Polo and Girbauds
Had coke since Arsenio
White girl; Marilyn Monroe, Demi Moore
I’m in LA with my skinny hoes
But they faces look like centerfolds
I’ve been taking all these chemicals, damn
Now they faces aren’t identical, damn
Watch these niggas turnin into hoes, bop-bop
Watch me turn a nigga into smoke, bop-bop
Watch me turn a million into four
Voilà, watch me turn Miami to NO
Uh-huh, watch me turn the sand to some snow
Uh-huh, in a Phantom with Chinchilla floors
Drop top, hit Atlanta like Gorilla Zoe
Holla at my baby mamas, I love them the most
Shout out Lauren on the West, she playin her role
Literally, on the set, she playin a role
Niggas really rep the set, we stay in our mode (turned up)
Spiritually I’m just blessed, I pray for my hoes (amen)
Tunechi hoppin off the jet, G open my door (thank you)
Spittin since Das EFX, my flow in control
Pimpin since Das EFX, my hoe in control
And I just popped a combo, ain’t talkin McDonald’s
Niggas hear that click-clack, ooh-ooh
I know I'mma get my shit back, ooh-ooh
We aiming this thing at your body
We aiming this thing at your nose
Hollow tip bullets, blue tip bullets
Well you’re gonna get shot with them both
