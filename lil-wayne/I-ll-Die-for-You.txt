Hey, I tried to treat you like no other
To be like no other in your life
Hey, and I'd die to see you with another
To see you with another dude in your life

Hear me out please, hear me out
Hear me out before you walk up out the door
Hear me out please, hear me out
Before you walk up out that fuckin' door

I love you like no other, I do you like no other
I swear to God I motherfuckin' tried
I do you like no other, I treat you like no other
Without you in my life I'd fuckin' die

I'd die without you, I'd die
I'd die without you, I'd die
I'd die without you

I'll cry until you see an ocean
I'm sinkin' to the ocean floor to my demise
Ohh I'd die to see you with another
To see you with another, to be in your life, ohh noo

Hear me out please, hear me out
Hear me out before you walk up out the door
Hear me out please, hear me out
Before you walk up out that fuckin' door

I love you like no other, I treat you like no other
I need you in my motherfuckin' life
I treat you like no other and there won't be another
There won't be another Mr. Right

I'd die without you, I'd die
I'll die without you, I'll die
I'll die without you, I'll die
I'll die, ohhh

Bury me a G
Yeah, bury me a G when I die
Bury me a G when she cry
And I'll be lookin' down from the sky
Bury me a G
Yeah, bury me a G when I die
Bury me a G
And I, I'll swear

You gon hear me out, yeah hear me out
Hear me out before you walk up out my door
You gon hear me out
Don't you walk up out my fuckin' door

I love you like no other, I treat you like no other
I need you in my motherfuckin' life
I do you like no other, I treat you like no other
I promise, I swear I'd die without you

Die without you, die without you
Die without you, I'd die without you
Die without you, die without you
Die without you
