Tool on deck
Why would I lie
Nigga you a pussy
Hope you got 9 lives
I could hit a nigga with the 9-9 times
Country ass boy
Country like Leanne rimes
Mississippi d-banner
And lil weezyanna
Everybody got tools
So you will need a hammer
I'm a pill poppin animal
Syrup sipping nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
Your fucking with this man
You can be this man dinner
The 9 give me brains
But the AK add leva
The rapper is insane
Flowing like a mad river
Make your ass quiver
Like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho
Hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water
You just long john silver
I got a girl
You want to meet her
Her name is 9 millimeter

Can you handle it
808 bang in the back with the woofer like boom boom boom boom
With my foot on the pedal and my hand on my strap
Got the engine like vroom vroom vroom vroom
What's up, you ain't never heard a nigga rap like-like this before
I got an addictive flow that'll give you
I'm a make you satisfied, even if it kills me
Even if it takes the slower minds, a little bit of time to feel me
Recollect the 15 million I sold, or the 30 times I went gold
And if you take 2 puffs of this dro, it'll give you
I've sold the most and noone's close, but I'm not meaning to brag
It's different strokes for different folks, like Angelina and Brad
Some keep the heat in the stash, put 30 keys in their Jag
And if cops ain't peepin your tag then you're gonna feel some
Pumpin' out albums like Reverend Run is pumpin out children, here's another one
So catch me on more 24's than Kiefer Sutherland
I'm bound to be the greatest, I'm determined to win
Until then I can't get no

I'm the one that went to the gunfight with a knife, and won
Left with his pistol and left him dead, the guy he tried to run
Just because my verse 2nd don't mean I am not the one
When I'm done I'm guaranteed to give you
I might not be the best in the world, but the best the world ever seen
I'm all been in Georgia's daughter Conde ding-a-ling king
And when I'm digging deep in the spleen, I'm a make the cream and she scream
Baby get me hard like a Snickers bar I give her
Yessir there ain't not other way so motherfuck what you say
Y'all had this spot, we took you off the top like a toupee
Them coke's been kick and pushed in this fiasco like Lupe
Back that ass up like Juve, cause the south we givin them
Ever since I signed with Luda and them, my chances of losing are slim
Y'all talk that smack but copycat and do a movie like him
Yessir my mob got that goodie, as if my group had a kid
We gonna continue to give them a double dose of
