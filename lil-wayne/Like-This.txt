Jim johnson rico bloods
ok ok ok
ok ok ok
ok ok ok

ok I flirt
She lookin like my future in a skirt
Weezy f baby natural burnt
I a ride til I die
Like I'm drivin mah hurse
I'm sick an she must be my nurse
I'm a guardian angel like I'm born in a manger
Pardon my anger I'm caught in a tangle
Like we know each other
Roots in the graden of strangers
She make my heart feel tha strangest
But I like it, I love it
I'm tryin to make something of it
She make me feel better than tha best rapper
I'm a need a best man an your best pastor
