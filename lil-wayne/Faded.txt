Young Nino, f-ck a bitch in a peacoat
Carlito, Scarface, Al Pacino
Bun B though, Pimp C, R.I.P though
I goes deep in that p-ssy, Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, f-ck her to my own single
Break a bitch hard, no future Miss Cleo
Snap back, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a f-ck-ng beatle, you can’t beat ‘em
Vampire f-ck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don’t believe it, stripe like a f-cking adidas
The gun Selena, give a n-gga Beiber fever
Real f-ck-ng hot, put it in park
Take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You a bop, give me top top, as I load the guap
Man these n-ggas say I’m fly but to her I’m God

[Hook]
I’m faded faded faded
My n-gga I’m faded faded faded (x7)

And I don’t give a f-ck

[Tyga]
F-ck is up, n-gga’s stomping in my Chucks
Yeah I make it rain dear, cause I’m all ’bout my bucks
Use the butt up in the front, d-ck up in her cunt
And I put her in her hole, holy, one, quat quat
Ergggh
Super McNasty, why you McLovin
When the b-tch call me daddy
Pimp no caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog, called the b-tch Lassy
Young savvy, bang her like Cincinatti
Above average, f-fly like I’m Aladdin
They bend backwards, done the p-ssy at them
I’m Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket
Balls in the air, no games, I’m serious, double dare
There’s too many b-tches, Why these n-ggas wanna stare
Pat Ron up in here, This ain’t no beer

[Lil' Wayne]
Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, Magic Johnson
My mutherf-cking doctor, said I need a doctor
So I called house, now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinnys, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she won’t get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch tities
Bringing home the bacon, I’m f-ckin’ Miss Piggy
Loaded like a semi, semi naked pictures
She knows my d-ck, she call it nigga Richard
Prior to me coming, I had to stick my thumb in
I asked one time, smell my finger make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can’t beat it, join it
Tunechi, punechi, that what she call it
Flag Scarlett, I killed it, mourned it
