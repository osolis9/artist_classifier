To your hard drive

And soon we locked eyes
She caught it like it was a routine pop fly

Committed to the cash
All I see is pussy, titties and the ass

Call me Wezzy F. bitch
I'm straight from the street
Dope game is sour
And the dope is sweet

I live in the tower
Got a scope on the heat
Hit you from 100 feet
We don't even have to meet

Ya bitch love me
We don't even have to meet
But if I run into her
Believe me, I will hold up

Ya bitch love me
We don't even have to meet
But if I run into her
Believe me, I will do her

And if that bitch is crazy
Believe, I will sue her
Got some hungry ass lawyers
That would eat her up and chew her

I don't know why you love her
I wish, I never knew her
She only give me brain
She was just another tutor

She blew my whole band
I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick
And get lost in Aruba

Young money over bitches
Get money from them bitches
