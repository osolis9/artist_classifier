Uh, I got shotguns under my staircase
Rob yo' hoe-ass bare face
Been had this bitch on lock, I'm 'bout to get this bitch a cellmate
All my life I been this cold
All my nights I spend with hoes
I keep change on me now, cause this shit's startin' to take a toll
I just flew two hoes in, oh how times fly, clip its wings
Make you spit that safe combination out like Listerine
And even though I'm not an artist, this is where I draw the line
We don't feel none of you niggas, y'all some fuckin' porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates, real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain't having that, I give ‘em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo' ass like a baby takin' his first steps
I'm too good for just any bad bitch
Smoke like I've been kissing dragons
That milk carton show her missing panties
That pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I'm so gifted, I wouldn't return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end, like this blunt burning my fingertips
Lil Tune

This ain't what you want
Put that gun to yo' hoe head, make her tell me what you don't
Got some moon rocks in my pocket, that's a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me, cause I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong, oh
Neil Armstrong, oh, Neil Armstrong
Fuck with me, cause I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong
Got some moon rocks in my pocket, that's a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me, cause I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong, woo

Striper pole on the yacht
Striper pole in my spot
I got yo' girl in my condo
Bitch I'm ballin' like Rondo
Flexin' ranches up in Texas
I know it's a blessing, but I don't know what's a recession
If we talkin' mew mew's, Jimmy Chews and Giuseppe, she got it
I start 6-7, my flights I fly private
Woo, I'mma walkin' hedge fund
I copped a 62 for leg room
This bitch text saying her lights off
I bought her a new crib, it's a tax right off

Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Forever
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Hold it
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Step up in this kitchen
Just step back till you look at me
Listen, that Ferrari unreleased
Stop being so defensive, I'm making real decisions
And that's the reason why we winnin'
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas

Rich Gang, we drop feathers to ball
Rich Gang, ball till you fall
We hit the block dippin' cause the block hot
Record sales, ship it from the Hard Knox
Live it like we live it twice
Ballin' with them bright lights
Bad bitches stand tall
Bad bitches, want ‘em all
Hella choppers on the surface
Mansion on the beach, nigga that's the purpose
Blow it cause the swag is perfect
First class flights, nigga we done murked ‘em

Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Forever
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Hold it
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
Step up in this kitchen
Just step back till you look at me
Listen, that Ferrari unreleased
Stop being so defensive, I'm making real decisions
And that's the reason why we winnin'
Don't like the way I'm ballin' on these niggas
