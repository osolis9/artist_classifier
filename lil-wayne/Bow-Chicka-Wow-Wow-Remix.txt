Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl

I hear you knock, knock, knock baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got something in yo' cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep and I ain't tryin' to sleep
Get your red bull on 'cause I'm ready

You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Don't tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you gon' do, whatchu gon' do

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow, wow
Whatchu gonna say? You act like you gon' leave
But I know that you gon' stay
Break it down dicky down, down
Girl, don't even play, once I set the mood right
I'ma make sound like

I'ma make you sound like

Are you tryin' to make me late wait, wait
Till the second date
But I cant cant cant even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, lemme jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy

You've been playin' hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Don't tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you gon' do, whatchu gon' do

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow, wow
Whatchu gonna say? You act like you gon' leave
But I know that you gon' stay
Break it down dicky down, down
Girl, don't even play, once I set the mood right
I'ma make you sound like

Yeah, I can make you sound like

I gotta leather couch and a black mic
And we all alone, what it sound like
The night was dead, we found life
I know I talk shit but it sound right

You say you can't but that's affair
Gotta give something, something's gotta give
I bet you love it, I went to bed
Now we went up cigarettes

Now I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive girl, you know you like that
Owo, ho, who, owo, woh
Say I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive girl you know you like that
Owo, ho, who, owo, woh

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow, wow
Whatchu gonna say? You act like you gon' leave
But I know that you gon' stay
Break it down dicky down, down
Girl, don't even play, once I set the mood right
I'ma make you sound like

Yeah, I'ma, I'ma make ya

Once I throw on this, once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this,once I throw on this
