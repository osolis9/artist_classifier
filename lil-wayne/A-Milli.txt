Young Money
Ya digg
Yeah, Mack I'm going in

A millionaire
I'm a Young Money millionaire tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the al mighty dollar
And the al mighty power of that chit cha cha chopper
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motherfuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers… hahahaha you can't catch ‘em, you can't stop ‘em
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat ‘em then you pop ‘em
You can't man ‘em then you mop ‘em
You can't stand ‘em then you drop ‘em
You pop ‘em cause we pop ‘em like Orville Redenbacher

Mutherfucker I'm ill

Yeah

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair
With coke in her derier
Like smoking the thinnest air I open the Lamborghini
Hoping them crackers see me like look at that bastard Weezy
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mutherfuking problem
Ok your a goon but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothing, nothing you ain't scaring nothing
On some faggot bullshit call ‘em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want bitch call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private damn I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch yeah I hate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch ahaha
Yeah nigga that's my bitch
so when she ask for the money when you through don't be surprised bitch
And it ain't tricking if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass you ain't got shit
Mutherfuker I'm ill, not sick
And I'm ok, but my watch sick
Yeah my drop sick

Yeah my glock sick
And my knot thick

I'm it

Mutherfuker I'm ill
Yeah, see…

They say I'm rapping like BIG, Jay and 2Pac
Andre 3000 where is Erika Baduh at
Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne
My name ain't Bic but I keep that flame man
Who that one that do that boy ya knew that you done swallow
And I be the shit now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Then to be in the Pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Mutherfuker I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the Coupe like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Damn that
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me
I'm illy
