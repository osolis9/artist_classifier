[Chorus:]
Who am I, to doing mine*
Give me the chance I'm a Letcha go,
I wanna be more than just sexual,
But they are ready every time,

I'm so gone (gone-on-on), so gone
And you gone forever now.

Young Mula Baby,
'I'm a blood I'm a thug I'm a g'
In a different world outerspace with a freak,
But that don't mean neptune on the beat,
'Cause a nigga called the devil from black wall street'
Weezy F baby from young money baby,
Like the easter bunny baby wanted my candy,
So I gave her my lollipop then she made her body pop,
Then that made me kinda hot,
I'm lying that made me sauna hot,
But please 'stop sweatin me', women scream "get in me",
And what do I do I get in it, I put on my boot and I step in it,
Right left in em mr eterceden,
Head it all the time, and they suck on you like the head on my mind
'Read on a line I'm just little young carter'
And yeah I hear you screaming but my name ain't harder!
Girl I'm nasty 'I do my thang and have you calling for me like last week'

[Chorus:]
Who am I, to doing mine,
Give me the chance I'm a Letcha go,
I wanna be more than just sexual,
But they are ready every time,

I'm so gone (gone-on-on), so gone
And you gone forever now.

I'm a flirt man I really don't care,
I tell the women whatever they wanna hear,
Mammy I'm balling I'm so sincere,
Is that your home girl sitting right there,
She can be my monday,
You can be my tuesday,
After shorty done I can squeeze ya'll in two days,
Three is not a crowd I don't care what you say,
My women come in twos like shoes with a cute face!
My girl gotta girlfriend, her girl gotta girlfriend,
Bring her to the crib I'm a show you how run it through,
Little man in the boat her come the serpeants,
Slide your body down the pole and let me see you twerk it,
I'm with my thursday junk she a real freak,
A hundred grand fitting right up in her butt cheek,
Mrs friday go weezy cause shes just running,
But saturday be having mr devil so struggling

[Chorus:]
Who am I, to doing mine,
Give me the chance I'm a Letcha go,
I wanna be more than just sexual,
But they are ready every time,

I'm so gone (gone-on-on), so gone
And you gone forever now.
