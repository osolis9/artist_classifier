Bitch I'm Mack Maine and this young money u better get 'em

Straight out the hood a young hoodlum
Done what shouldn't did what they say I couldn't
Hid where all the killers hid at
Hung where the other hustlas slung at
Waiting on the get back
Get that
Flip that
Debating on the mix match
Switch that from dope to coke I'm blowin up fast
Now you niggas is slowing up fast
(secret weapons) "I can hear myself but I can't feel myself, I wanna feel myself like tweet!"
Now my niggas is blowin up aves
If I tell 'em you niggas is holding up cash
Rollin up stepping outta the phantom's ass
Put cha litters away ur talking 2 a can of gas
There's nothing 2 say no matter who comes to ask
And murder ain't funny but we do love to laugh
Shit we just living take money take baths
Take a nigga bitch and fuck her
And send her back wit nothing
Now isn't that disgusting
Give him back his sista give him back his cousin
Yea go make a stack or something
Go and buy yourself a spine and give back the fronting
Yea and to end that discussion
I been had strength I just got the muscle
Fuck ya this that n the other
I see my people struggle wish that they wasn't
The government try to put us in a muzzle
But ur 2 fingaz aint the pieces to da puzzle
Shit say to each his own hustle
And I hustle all night and then go home to the fussin
Then wake up to the fuckin
Breakfast in bed don't 4get my english muffin
Hawaiin punch tastes like robitussin
A nigga jus livin jus breathin jus puffin
Come on mama drop down and curl up
Dick millimeter cock back and murda
Aye senorita we cannot go any further
If my girl catch us both in the spot she will merk us
Pussy niggaz talkin all that slop we will merk cuz
Hungry ass niggaz I tote 2 hamburgers
Who want beef who want beef I bring it to ur front door and now you seem nervous
2 seater swervin
Traffic 2 hell wit it
Shit u can't die wit it can't go to jail wit it
Might as well wild in it passin and feelin it
Me I excel fishtail and tailwhip it
Give them niggaz sumthin 2 tell them bitches
Smellin like money at a full court scrimage
If found at the table got a 4 course dinner
Young money cash money dump a fatty on da winner
And yet he understood us so when we told em' break it off
Cuz gangstas don't' talk one word'll be a walk
And yo platoon can't handle the destruction
Hard body baby killin sound like seduction
Them niggaz chase dope bitches follow the instructions
Sometimes you gotta put the whole rooster in the oven
So tell the public I'ma do my thing
Just as soon as I hear dat bing
Gotta come in
Comin' up
You niggaz jus runner up
And runnin up'll get u in dat wheel chair forever
It's wutever
I'm still here forever
Cuz the lil'nigga better than all you niggaz together
I'm gone
