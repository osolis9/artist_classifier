What up doe? hahaha
Yes, this is the end of No Ceilings
I hope you enjoyed, I really do
And like I said, it was all for you
Thank you, I appreciate you
Everything about you
And again, this was and is No Ceilings
Yeah, this is just a message, your beat ain’t safe
Yeah, I just like to have fun
And so, they ask me why did I do this
Why do you keep – why do you give out free music
Why do you do this, why, why
Because I’m Weezy hah
I’m different
I have plenty of it, so it’s nothing for me to share
Priceless, that’s why it’s free
Yeah
No Ceilings!
Please don’t forget the F
Yeah
Young Money
That’s it
