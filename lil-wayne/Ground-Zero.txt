Back the hell off
Rock n Roll Jesus with all my nails on
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond
And give these blind motherfuckers something to feel on
Rollin’ like a motherfucker put your wheels on
And lets roll down the hill ’til the hill gone
I started on the block but that something to build on
And how can I pray when I got nothing to kneel on?

Hey, the ground is gone
Don’t look now but the ground is gone
I’m so high that the ground is gone
And I don’t even know which cloud I’m on
Don’t look down but the ground is gone
Don’t look down cause the ground is gone
Right now I’m a million miles from my home
And I’m so high that the ground is gone

Huh, walk on air, show me to the edge and I walk off there
We ain’t high enough au contraire, and sometimes life just don’t compare
Sa-say my name baby pull my hair, and I’mma fuck you like a bull I swear
I gotta lot of love that I could just share
I gotta lot of drugs that I could just share
I-I know, I know what you like girl? A nice lil mirror and a little white girl
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing
May I be everything but grounded
I don’t ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad
I don’t wanna ever see the bottom, the bottom
I just wanna float…

Hey, I know a girl named Crystal, her last name Ball
I look into her eyes and I can see it all
I see her when she cry, I’m there when she call
‘Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall
Kill ‘em all, die in the spirit of the war
Thinkin’ what am I being spiritual for?
Huh? Shit, cause ain’t no love, die while America drink your blood
It ain’t no hurricane, it ain’t no flood
This some other shit that we ain’t no of
Make that money, yeah make that money
Then watch the Government take that money
But we gon’ raise hell, motherfucker get well
Laws get passed and economies fail
Love, hate, emotion, compulsion, addiction, fiction, virgins
Dixons, minging, mixing, swinging, switching, swagging
Sweets, freets, faggots, flame, fashion, planes crashing, ground zero
