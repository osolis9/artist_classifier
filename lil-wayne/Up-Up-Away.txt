Up up and away
Up up and away
Up, up, up and away
Uh, yeah, I'm about to go

Up up and away
Dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin and cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face

Live for the night, sleep in the day
You high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog you should keep in the gate
Pussy, um, how sweet is the taste

Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy bitch, I'm deep inner space
Floatin' away like a leaf in the lake
I'm gone like delete and erase

Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad I'ma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit

Uhh, what they talkin' 'bout?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm runnin' them in, I'm walkin' them out
Cars so cold I park in the house

Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money talk, Lisa Leslie

Y.M., C.M.B. connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Warmin' up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fuckin' she can exit

Gun tucked in the waist
I bust in your face
I ain't got nothin' to say
But, up up and away

Up up and away, up up and away
Man, I'm so high I'll come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, yeah, up up and away, yeah
Man, I'm so high I'll come down in a couple of days

(Weezy)
Yeah
(Where you goin'?)
Up
(You're goin' a little bit too far)
Ha ha

Ain't this a bitch?
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill yo' ass
But you can still get pistol whipped

Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch, don't even twitch your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident

Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm cummin' home

You're whylin out then we're ridin out
Now you're Hidin out, Honeycomb
I'm laughin' to the bank
Like I just broke my fuckin' funny bone

What's really good five?
I'm over here smokin' that really good vibe
Eyes so high I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook time

I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape the housewives

I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just hostages

Let's cut to the chase
My bitch, no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothin' to say
But, up up and away, uh

Up up and away, up up and away
Man, I'm so high I'll come down in a couple of days
Uh, up up and away, yeah, up up and away, yeah
Man, I'm so high I'll come down in a couple of days

(Weezy)
Yeah
(Where you goin?)
Ha
(You're goin' a little bit too far)
Uh

Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away

Fuck with a nigga if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps On Deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you lookin' like lightnin' struck that nigga

Stacks On Deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm callin' my bitch the shit
Walkin' 'round on my fuckin' shit
I done did everything on my bucket list

Fuck that shit, I'm super bad
I don't give a hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggas
They should have a stupid tan

Ha, President Carter
Vote for Lil Wayne
Sit yo' five dollar ass down
'Fore I make change

I'm pumpin' your brakes
I'm jumpin' the gates
And I ain't got nothin' to say
But, up up and away

Weezy, where you goin'?
You're goin' a little bit too far
Uh

Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away, I say

Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Man, I'm so high I'll come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man, I'm so high I'll come down in a couple of days

Come here, I might need you
You'll have to tickle me or somethin'
I need to smoke a cigarette
