Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of vans
If you niggas keep trippin', nigga share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands, my gang poppin' niggas
Smoke that kush and not that reggie for you name droppin' niggas

All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say, "Bad bitches only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Man I'm on that patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked

Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go "Pu"
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah, all my niggas nuts and I'm a loose screw
Bitch I get big bucks pockets on Bruce Bruce

Yeah, I talk that shit, bitch I got red, bitch I got toast
Welcome to the murder show, I am the motherfuckin' host

I'm at their throats until they choke, the God has spoke
I need a smoke man [Incomprehensible]

Now eat these fuckin' bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
Dress like a skater, ride on you like Shawn White
I'm high all day, you can call that shit a long flight

Every nights a long night, every day is a holiday
I can fuck the squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes, I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yup I fuck it till it ovulate

Get her to the crib, get in that pussy just dominate
Weezy F Baby and the F is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren bitch, yeah, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate

Beau coup in the bezel of my watch with the diamond face
Still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I cannot make out what you tryna say
And if they want a war, tell them motherfuckers bombs away

All these bitches and niggas still hatin', man
I used to be a baller but now I'm Bill Gaten'
Got a list of full of problems, I tend to 'em later
Yeah, life is a bitch but I appreciate her, man
