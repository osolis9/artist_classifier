(Lil' Wayne)
Target practice baby
Only thing is, I'm not the shooter... I'm the bullet BITCH!

(Lil' Wayne)
Yeah
G'd up from the feet up
I got you Trae
A, B, C, D, E, F
I'm a G till the end
The end of the road
Sit back in the kitchen at the end of the stove
Hey T it looks like I'm at the end of the O
Drop a fo in the twenty ounce and call it twenty-fo's
You sit on twenty-fo's
and we sip on twenty-fo's
Got the caddie sittin on a pair of Gucci penny loafs
I get money, fuck wit bitches that give me mo
Now you know the game; same shit, different hoes
We cut the ears and tail off
Mickey Mouse
Never been a rat, never had em in the house
Call me Captain Kangaroo cause I got money in my pouch
I don't mean loose change when I say money in the pouch
YA DIG
I'm gettin paid thats what I already said
Can't see these niggas
Like to these niggas
Got a bitch named Nina and Nina's so slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his Buddy's

(Chorus)
(Lil' Wayne)
We put them drinks down and pick them two's up
And if dude trippin, we hit dude up
And you aint shit if you aint ever been screwed up
And you aint shit if you aint ever been screwed up
(Trae)
We drop the top down and chunk the deuce up
These eighty-fo's will make a hata put his shoes up
And you aint shit if you aint ever been screwed up
And you aint shit if you aint ever been screwed up
