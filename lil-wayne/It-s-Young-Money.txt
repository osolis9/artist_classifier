[** feat. Gudda Gudda:]


[Gudda Gudda:]
 I gets it in all day*
 In the studio all work, no play
 I could pay a visit to your block broad day
 Fuck what ya'll say I spit raw hard yay
 Millz twisting up the sticky not that barnyard hay
 We just getting to the money then get on our way
 Yep, 3 whips back to back
 Followed by a Cadillac truck
 Sluts with us, fake tits and they asses fat
 Gudda ain't ya average cat, I'm something like a savage gat
 Came up in the jungle and adjusted to this habitat
 I'm sick of niggas garbage raps
 I ain't bout to battle rap
 Grab the gat, hit em in his chest make a cabbage patch
 I'm after that chedder cheese nigga
 Where the cabbage at?
 Gudda Gudda motherfucker there'll be nothin' after that
 I'm bout to go HAM on this motherfucking track
 In fact I'm better than a lot of niggas better get yo raps intact
 See me on that big screen and think shits sweet
 Diarrhea music when I let this hot shit leak
 Uhh, take heed and listen when a real nigga speak
 Or slide down a razor blade up shits creek, nigga

[Gudda Gudda:]
 Uhh, I'm screaming MOB
 Money Over Bullshit
 Don't Bullshit me

[Lil Wayne:]
 Hello World it's Little full clip me
 Got that wake yo ass up can't let the bullshit sleep
 It's Young Money

 (It's Young Money)

 It's Young Money
 We take money
 It's Young Money
 (It's Young Money)

 It's Young Money
 We make money

[Lil Wayne:]
 I'm talking big money bitch
 Hammer stay cocked like Alfred the Hitch
 Take money like a pimp make money like a mint?
 Gettin money is the only time life make sense
 People like me, but people like spiders
 And spiders eat flies and you know what flies eat
 And kids are the only ones that really blush
 I'm real as fuck
 I pull that thing and hit em up
 That bullet travel hit a gut
 Then hit ya fitted up
 Hit ya whole city up
 Hit ya while ya laying down
 Shots leave ya sittin up
 Run in the bathroom on ya girl and get a titty fuck
 Right after I buss a nut I buss the gun get rid of her
 Ya bunch of pussy's having a pity party
 My guns look like they in kindergarten
 I'm the dirtiest seed in any garden
 Got more stripes on my sleeve than any sergeant
 The paralysed feel me, the blind see me
 And the deaf can hear me
 And the smart fear me
 Wh-which side you on?
 Hi-highway to heaven, I would drive you home
 Uhh

[Lil Wayne:]
 Eagle street where them twenty's go for 25
 Bitch I'm a boss I got ya hoe in my assembly line
 Here's Weezy F and the F is for Finish line
 I saved us from hip hop genocide
 Medication in my cup because my flow sick
 Got a syringe in my draws, call it dope dick
 And my girls say you niggas can't fuck with me
 Check my footsteps look like there was couple me's
 We ain't promised tomorrow but I feel immortal
 Bullets beat yo ass up like Miguel Cotto
 I'm the real Zorro, Rest in peace Torro
 And when I die, bury me in all Polo
 Kanyeezy's on my feet with two pony tails
 Bitch I'm hotter than going to hell
 Oh well and the money is my only mail
 And I'm the God sippin' syrup out the Holy Grail
 Oh well
 And you ain't on shit, nigga you ain't on shit
 It's Young Mula baby lose ya mind on every song bitch
 I'm in that cherry tone six
 I'm with a cherry tone bitch
 And she got very strong lips
 She got baritone lips so I tell her carry on bitch
 And when you in my home bitch
 You are coming out of your house of Dereon shit
 Twitter Wayne at the top of every song list
 I'm spittin like a long kiss
 Live from the throne bitch

[Chorus]
