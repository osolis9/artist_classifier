And I don't mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it

Heaven, have you ever been to it
'Cause you look like you never been
You're more like a hell's angel
And for you, I'd rather sin

Broken heart, love you with a broken heart
For you I'll jump off Noah's Ark
Love is blind and hope is dark
But why does pain feel so good
Love is science, live for you
Die for you and I'll die smiling

Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give

Should of known
You was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'd jump in front of a train for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue
Beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said hey
When you get back to where you're from

Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face
Then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'd jump in front of a train for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire, ooh
You'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did baby

But darling, I'll still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'd jump in front of a train for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'll never do the same
No, no, no, no
