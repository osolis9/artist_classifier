G Herbo, I'm some hot nigga
Before I started rap I used to pop niggas
Maskey told me lil bruh chill out cuz ya got hittas
Get this money and we gon' be at the top with ya
But ya still can catch be up on Essex block nigga
Smoking dutchies and Murch Money got that Glock with him
We No Limit, that's 150, we got all the bitches
They niggas hating that's the reason they want problems with us
All the new opps, they don't know us
Lil Herb don't rap beef, nigga blow sum'
And ya might catch me by my lonely, I'mma keep it on me
Check the news, I heard somebody went to sleep for Kobe
And I'm leaning right now, bitch, I'm sipping codein
I been the same, I been gangbanging since I been a shawty
I been fucking grown bitches since I been a shawty
Run thru that check like last month forgot I spent it, sorry
I went thru a hundred that's without a deal
I'm 18 and I don't give a fuck about a deal
People ask me all the time, ya on the block for real?!
Sometimes I stay up in the crib cuz fo n them down to drill
And they ain't shooting fo no legs, fo n them tryna kill
If I put them shooters on yo' ass then ya dying fo real
And bitch, I'm always in the field, Roc Block where ya find me
Fifteen hunids in my jeans, all my jewelry shining
.30s and them .40s all my niggas sliding
Riding thru the opps, all them niggas hiding
Don't let them tell ya that they out there, man, them niggas lying
Met some of them niggas and free all my niggas doing time
Matter fact free G Gills
He doing 20 in the feds cuz he didn't squeal
Free Bruce, free Breezy hoe
Free Slick and Crazy Jay, they some demons hoe
Vito City, that's the team low
Pistol game, yeah, we keep low
Dizzy's with em 30s and them beams low
Run up on us and we squeezing hoe
Lil Bro too trigger happy, he gon' squeeze some mo'
Bitches wait in line fo pictures when I leave my shows
Only got a couple minutes, take a couple flizzicks
Finesse a bitch right to the trunk and now she sucking dizzick
After I get what I wanted you gotta do fo' n â€˜dem
She told me that she ain't want to, said she that she don't know them
Ya don't wanna turn up bitch, ya don't know me anyway
Ya ain't tryna top off bruh n them get out on the E-way
All my niggas, we be running bitches like a relay
Sucker niggas beefing over bitches, we can't relate
Why ya mad at me my nigga? That bitch pussy funky
Ya buy her all type of shit and I don't give her nothing
She probably like the way a nigga stunt
Thumbing thru these twenties, fifties, hundreds
This shit ain't nothing, man, I'm still a yungin
And I neva been a stain, run up in there drumming
Neva catch me with no lames, all my niggas goblins
All I hang wit hustlas, killas, robbers
Ya a lame, took yo chain, my lil shawties tarving
We got aim, don't get banged, ya a fucking target
Kobe Squad, that's what we are
Six forties riding round, we in 3 cars
Flipping thru they set, where them niggas at?
Caught a body last night, I'on have no time fo that
And bruh n them still lurking, still creeping ho
Off lean, they off xans but they ain't sleeping tho
Tryna catch another body like a week ago
Forgot about that other body, we been drinking ho
Leaning ho, all I sip is codeine lil ho
Get my dicked sucked fo Kobe while I drink a four
And if ya tryna' catch feelings then ya tweaking ho
Ball like I'm Kobe on the way I'm tired of speaking ho
Gang!
