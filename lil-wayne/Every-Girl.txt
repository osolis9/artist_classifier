Uh, I like a long-haired, thick red bone
Open up her legs then filet mignon that pussy
I'ma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in I'ma own that pussy

Gon throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick, now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you dopey
Tell em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me

Huh, but you can't come and tunecha
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise I should be hooked on phonics, ha ha

But anyway I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it back, back it up and dump it back)

'Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

Yeah, alright
She be jumpin' up and down tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they want to talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all

Young money man this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded so please bring your finest
And what are all your names again? We drunk, remind us
Are any y'all into girls like I am? Let's be honest

She wants me, she wants me 'cause I got it all shawty
Tell me what you don't see I will fuck with all yall
All y'all are beautiful I just can't pick one
So you can never say I'm choosy hoes

And Wayne say pussy pussy pussy
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around that make a nigga reconsider man

'Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

I ain't being disrespectful baby I'm just being Millz
And I don't know how fake feels so I gotta keep it real
I just wanna fuck every girl in the world

Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every house of Diddy, check every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva

My role model was Will
So married boy I'm in the milf
It don't matter who you is miss
You can get the business, ha

These hoes is god's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all y'all
I'm scrollin down my call log and I'ma call all y'all

My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out 'papi' every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy I gets my pimpin' on

'Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

And bitch I'm mack maine-aine-aine-aine
Sanaa lathan, Meagan Good, Angelina Jolie, ha
D Woods for free suites I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no, not at all

Kit Kat a midget, if that ass soft I break her off
I exchange v cards with the retards
And get behind the Christian like DR
'Cause he are Mack Mizzo, baby
'Cause he are Mack Mizzo, baby

'Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
