Cuz I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, it was love at first Sprite
Counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, yeah got me walking round' feeling like Dolemite
These niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
There pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied

Yeah
Bad bitch on my team
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen
Got lipstick everywhere
I got her shaking on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a electric chair, lord
I got liquor, I got cigarettes
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS
I don't think you should see him, nor live off per diem
She just took off her clothes, and said you ain't lying
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down, mama
She said don't worry son I help you make bond
Cuz these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in yo face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating karat cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a muthafuckin K9 now
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
But her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither

But I don't look into her snake eyes

I ain't got no type no
But when I met codeine, it was love at first sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my swisher sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, yeah got me walking around feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
Their pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied yeah
But when I met codeine, it was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my swisher sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife yeah, got me walking around feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, and they don't get out of line
I'm sorry for the wait, til I drop Tha Carter 5 yeah
These hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
