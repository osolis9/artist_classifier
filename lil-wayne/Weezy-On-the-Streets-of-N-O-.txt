Right now man, the streets of New Orleans is real fucked up man
But don't look at it like that because
I ain't gonna lie, it's so bad--it's not back to normal cause it will never be
But, I mean, it's back to the way that you probably didn't think it would be back to
So you know what I mean, people are living, people are breathing
But you know what I mean that's just still what's fucked up
And it's gonna always be fucked up and people are still fucked up about it
And people are still fucked up over it
People died, and that's what's real about it
You know what I mean, the streets is gonna always be fucked up
