I'm a New Orleans gangtsa, after the storm
Boy it took bout 3 million to rebuild my home
But, I'm back on defense I'm back in the zone
I eat rappers go in my yard and bury they bones
My pockets on "Raven Symone"
Thats fat!
Wutchu know bout that, huh!?!
So I'm a keep it goin'
Keep it movin'
We can do it
I ain't trippin
So far ahead of them niggas we got a time difference
Dont confuse me wit them, I'm different
Tryin to holla at "TIP" for a movie audition
I push that Maserati to the limit
Zig zaggin through that traffic like Emmitt
I tell them niggas hurry and buy
And if you try n snitch you'll get burried alive
Yeah, and I dont chase 'em like you do
I keep a bad bitch skatin' like 'New-New'
