Yezzir, it's me, the rapper eater
Feed me, feed me, feed me, no homo

One time for me, one time for the DJ
He be Khaled, I be Li'l Weezy
Baby, if you ask me, if you're nasty
Creative gifted bastard, spit sporadic
I'm so diplomatic democratic
Touch it, bring it, push it systematic

Damn right, I kissed my daddy
I think they pissed at how rich my daddy is
And I'm his kid, I stunt with my daddy
Call Mrs. Lee, she's with my daddy
So diss me and don't diss my daddy

'Cause who was there when no one wasn't?
Just my daddy
Who was there when I needed money?
Just my daddy

So who'll be there when I see the money?
Just my daddy
Who said that I be the one?
Just my daddy
Hello hip hop, I'm home, it's your daddy

When I say D's, I don't mean the caddy
I mean 'Deez nuts' Akon's and Khaled's
Rick Ross, TIP, Stunna and Fat Joe
And I can't, can't, can't forget Brisco
And yeah, I done squashed the bullshit, it's rizo

It's a bakery here, just trying to get dough
Shout to my dreads, my Haitians and Chico's
You're lookin' for me hoe?
I'm in the 305, I'm the best rapper alive

Homeboy got a mind that a map wouldn't find
Homeboy got a 9, that a cop wouldn't find
I could get to it even if I was blind
Scary movie be screaming when I rhyme

I'ma king, you can ask Stephen if I'm lying
I'ma prince too, demanding like my mom
Too bold, too cold like wet salam, me, me it's all about me
If a girl gotta voice then she talking about me

Me, he say, she say, I say me
Will be in the M-I-A me wth me and T and Big Ronnie
And the homie street probably somewhere on the beach
And Tez and E probably somewhere in the jeep

And Marl in the Phantom with Mr. G
And me, me, it's all about me
Play with me and it's all out beef
Beef, yes, chest, feet, tag, bag, blood, sheets

Yikes, yeeks, great Scott
Storch, can I borrow your yacht?
Watch me and my click go all out
Like the ball in the stands, we balls out

Boy, I don't know what y'all 'bout
But I just spit like a dog mouth
Pink ice just looking like a hog mouth
Vrrrmmm, I had to bring the hog out

Light them trees bring the log out
Everyday Christmas, I'm egged nogged out
And hip hop is my new bought house
My flow just grew legs and walked out bye
