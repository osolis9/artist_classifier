(Chorus: Lil Wayne)
Tell them boys I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol that I own

Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol
Every day with every pistol
Yeah

(Verse 1:)
Nigga you done fucked up
Nigga back the fuck down
I don't care where I go
I don't care who You know
I don't care 'bout what you say
I put them words back down ya throat
I don't care where you stay
Nigga I'm from uptown
I gotta get 'em slim
They talkin' beef to me
They just a bunch of bitches
They talkin' sweet to me
Pussy niggas
I guess I gotta eat pussy
Put a hole in 'em
Now that's a deep pussy
The cops hate me
But a star's born
The streets love me
But how long will they mourn
I'm a real nigga
Say real nigga thangs
Bullet don't have no name

(Chorus:)
Tell them boys I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol that I own

Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol
Every day with every pistol
Look

(Verse 2:)
I never fold
But I just take my chance
I let life deal
And I just play my hand
Protection off safe
I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas Weezy"
That's what the .380 said
You gotta play in the field to get paid
And then you gotta go lay in that bed that you made
This Cash Money, this the army brigade
And I'm spittin' like I ate a grenade
I'm dippin' in that apron to fade
Hittin' four with the butt
Put the wings up and straight show 'em my guts
Hate my swagga so mean
And I know how to operate that machine
(Bllllllllllllrrrrrrr)

(Chorus:)
Tell them boys I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol that I own

Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol
Every day with every pistol
Yeah

(Verse 3:)
Aim at his brain
Make a nigga learn
And if that's choppa bullets
Then they suppose to burn
And if you went in jail
I never saw a cell
But I come from New Orleans
Yeah, right there under hell
Tell my gal don't you worry 'bout nothin'
But see these niggas want me dead
So hold me tight when you fuck me
I told her I'm strapped I'm a rida girl
And I'm a shoot from every side like around the world
Uh, believe that and you can tell 'em bring the whole gang
I'm gon' get you with that automatic touchin' e'er'thang
Nigga it's the Bird Mayne
J.R. pure pain
You just a curb stain

(Chorus:)
Tell them boys I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol that I own

Tell 'em I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga that got love for me
See, I got money on my mind
But the haters won't leave me 'lone
So I'm ridin' every day with every pistol
Every day with every pistol
