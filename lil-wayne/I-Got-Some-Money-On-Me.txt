It's a Dramani beat

Yeah, pot the music up
You understand me? Y.M., C.M.B.
C4, let's go, Young, Yeah, uh

I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I don't be politicking, I'm not political
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, bitch, I'm Kenneth Cole
My goons masked up, Rey Mysterio

Bitch, eat somethin' I don't like skinny hoes
I hit her from the back, she on her tippie toes
I smoke that Green Day, I'm on my Billie Joel
I'm a dog, bitch, B-I-N-G-O

I'm a rich ass nigga, you bitch ass nigga
I'm from the school of hard knocks, you skip class, nigga
Tell her bust that pussy open, bend it over, bring it back
Get some brain out that hoe and call that hoe a Brainiac

I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Bitch I'm Kenny Cole

Every bad bitch love me, I'm Young Money
Tell 'em pop that pussy for me, pop that pussy for me
And my niggas got the guns, they aimin' at ya skully
Tell 'em pop that pussy for me, pop that pussy for me

Uptown gangster life
Made man, 5 Star, nigga
Ya understand me, give a hundred
And hundreds, one hundred

Yeah, if you a bad bitch, say, "Fuck them other hoes"
I'm in my lane, bitch, you a gutter bowl
Boogers in the watch, it got a runny nose
I like a pink pussy just like a bunny nose

And we are Young Money, The Untouchables
I hit her from the back, I make her touch her toes
I'm on that drink, baby, I think I'm comatose
I'm feelin' real good, Stevie Wonder-ful

And e'rybody with me strapped, tell them hoes adapt
Shoot 'em in his head, he dead before he collapse
Young Money we the crap, no salary cap
Money talks, bitch, and mine's yap, yap, yap

I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
If you a bad bitch, say, "Fuck them other hoes"
I'm feelin' real good, Stevie Wonder-ful

And we don't talk about it, we do, it do it, nigga
Shit can get ugly, Patrick Ewing, nigga
Them niggas can't see me but I see through them niggas
And fuck the police on or off duty, nigga

Yeah, Young Money gunners
Cash Money Mobsters
Hittin' shots, one up top
Top flo'

I'm on some other shit, I'm stuntin' on them hoes
Bitch, I'm smokin' pot like I'm on a stove
I'm in this bitch pitch, I'm so Holly Grove
Them hoes treasure me like a pot of gold

Boy, you thin crust, fuckin' Dominos
I'm laughin' to the bank, this shit is comical
We do it real big, astronomical
I make her fall for me, bitch, Geronimo

Now get it poppin' for a nigga, show me what you're workin' with
I'm fly as a motherfucker bitch, no turbulence
Please know my niggas got them pistols for emergencies
I'm lookin' for a head, doctor for some brain surgery

Some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I'm laughin' to the bank, this shit is comical
I make her fall for me, bitch, Geronimo

Fifty shots in the chopper, break 'em off proper
You niggas can't see me, fuck yo' binoculars
I'ma coconut Ciroc'er, a beast like Chewbacca
I'm runnin' this shit, I don't even need blockers, uh huh

Priceless, fresh off an island
Hundred mill, bitch we the business
5 Star gangsta, moolah crazy

I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
