You aint talkin bout shit if you aint talkin bout this
Dont worry bout me, worry bout my bitch
Dont worry bout me, worry bout my bitch

[chorus]
I got a bitch named nina, and nina's so slutty

In the back of the back, its just me and my little brother bitch,

And i like to eat rappers like he like to eat snacks

How 'bout your funeral? let me emcee that!
Three emcee facts, my name's dwayne michael carter, dmc's back!
Nigga walk this way, and i'mma paint your ass like an art display
Im really rich, i just talk this way,
And maybe if you get rich you'll talk this way!
See, right now im talkin' foreign, you dig? im talkin foreign -
Leave a hole in the boy big enough to park a car in
Youre on, but you aint on it, im more on like warren
Moon, boom! now my bitch talkin' for me.
Damn, and she's so slutty, 'cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Man, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
