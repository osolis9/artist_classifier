Tell 'em

I done spent so many of my days without you (yeah)
I done lost all my love and found my way without you
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you
Without you

Uhh
How you doing? Me? I'm a mess
I feel powerless
Hands around this bottleneck
Mmh, you got a new one - I'm not impressed
And if he trying to flex
You can give him my address
Yeah, I be trying to rest
But, Lord the Devil busy
And when I do, I dream of you, and then the Devil pinch me
Do you ever miss me?
Do you ever wish we
Get it right and the rest is history?
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my lack of time
Because back then I had to grind
But see you thought I'd rather grind
You thought I had the time
Thought I was lyin half the time
And now I fantasize
And agonize
To pass the time
Lord

I done spent so many of my days without you (uh)
I done lost all my love and found my way without you (yeah)
I done gave up my soul (yeah) and gave up my pride (yeah)
And taped up my heart (yeah) and wiped off my eyes without you
(Without out) Without you(Without you)

Uhh
How you doing? I can tell
You look like yourself
And I look like I'm by myself
Fuck it
But I'm getting through it
I might as well
Cause I know time will tell
But it be moving like a snail
Yeah, you got a new one -
I wish you well
Then I bite my nails
I'm scared I might hear wedding bells
I guess I blew it
It never fails
You was tired of waiting to exhale
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my frame of mind
Back when everything was fine
And we would never think of dyin
And I was yours and you was mine
And we combine and intertwine
And now we in decline
Finish line
End of time
Lord
Woo!

I done spent so many of my days without you
I done lost all my love and found my way without you
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you
Without you

Now you been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong?
I'm left to live life alone, I'mma need more styrofoams
If you find your way home you know that porch light is on
I lay in bed wishing your side was warm
We wish we could go back in time and push it in reverse
Cause this shit ain't for us baby, this shit for the birds
But I know what I'll do, I'll move on, I got to
And this is to you, for you, about you, without you, girl
I done spent so many, way too many
Of my days without you
I done lost all my love
Lord

I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you
Without you

How you doing?
I can tell
Yeah
How you doing?
I can tell
you look like yourself
im by myself
