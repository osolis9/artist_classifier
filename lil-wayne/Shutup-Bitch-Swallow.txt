Start with straight shot
And then pop bottles
Pour it on the models
Shutup bitch, swallow

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

I got one in the back
I got one in the front
I make 'em do what I say
They tell me say what I wanna

I tell her, get yo money girl
And just stop breathing
'Cause if it ain't about that dough
It ain't about me neither

See a gangster like myself
I get that paper on women
Man, yo, women probably out there
With some paper to give me

Listen, you lookin' at a real pimp
Ask my old women
And they tell you no remote I control women
I'm a whole load

Put me in the game woman
If he a payin' then he shouldn't be playin'
I'm sayin', broke dudes only make jokes funny
I make more than I can fit in this quote, honey

Unquote comes sun soak with me, mah
Fly you down here and lay you up in my beach house
An' if you smile at my girl, I'll make her smile back

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig

Shutup bitch, swallow
Shu-shutup bitch, swallow
If you can't swallow
Shutup bitch, goggle ya dig
