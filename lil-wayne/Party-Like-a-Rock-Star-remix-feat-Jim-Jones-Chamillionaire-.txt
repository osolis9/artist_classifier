Rock star, rock star, rock star, it's rock 'n' roll
I got ladies that love my ladies
Haters that hate my haters, I'm a Chamillionaire
But got billionaires for my neighbors
I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks
The crowd screamin' loud in every city on the map
Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring 'em backstage and tell 'em baby just relax
Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick, like flu spit and flu cough
Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off
Keep the 4 iron near, keep on thinkin' that it's for golf
Nickel plate on your head, silverware's food for thought
The Grammy winner the haters is like, 'How could this happen?'
On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin
How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?
If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far
'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smellin', they yellin' 'Where That Nirvana?'
The crowd is rockin' 'n' rollin', them swishers full of marijuana
They judgin' me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said, â€½Know why I got my lighter up?'
'Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'ma 'Puff'
See how we rippin' up tickets that police be writin' us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
I got 'em screamin' loud as they be screamin' comin' out broads daily
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady
Like a rock star, like a rock star
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job
When they listen to the cops come then I'ma
I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks
The crowd screamin' loud in every city on the map
Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring 'em backstage and tell 'em baby just relax
Rock 'n' roll fly, bitch behold I, I am the shit
Hear the commode cry, hear the guitar scream
That double R lean and if it's for me, then it's foreign
I mean my cars, I mean my clothes, I mean my hoe's, I mean my flows
You dress different round then me I'ma clean your nose
Step into the line of fire hide the [Incomprehensible]
Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes
I get ya girlfriend wet like wrinkled clothes
Rock star like, money, drugs, freaky hoes
World tours, walk throughs and TV shows
My hair's out, no shirt, I stage dive, I crowd surf
Reportin' to you live from the moshpit
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
I got 'em screamin' loud as they be screamin' comin' out broads daily
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady
Like a rock star, like a rock star
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job
When they listen to the cops come then I'ma
I'm so cool, I'm so smooth, I'm that dude, I'm so fly
Groupies tellin' me like a spy, the ground be tellin' me that I'm fly
The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I
Got Mother Nature so jealous she knockin' pigeons out the sky
Can't help it, I got 'em rockin' they pelvic bones and losin' clothes
The higher my album sales get, they love me
That's right you nailed it, they treatin' me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed, she licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the amphitheater
We packin' stadiums, ladies come in, I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza
We outshinin' the losers, know I ride with the Ruger
You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla
Got no time to seduce a super head type of seducer
Groupies tryin' to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusa's
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
I got 'em screamin' loud as they be screamin' comin' out broads daily
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady
Like a rock star, like a rock star
Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star
Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job
When they listen to the cops come then I'ma
Rock on, rock, rock
Rock on, rock, rock
We gonna keep on rockin' 'n' rollin' till the wheels fall off
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout? Chamillitary Mayne
Young Money, we the new Red Hot Chili Peppers
We on fire, sold out arenas tearin' up tour buses
You know how we get down, rock on, hold up, hold up, hold up
Tryin' get the Ozzy Osborne paper Mayne
I'ma throw a pool party, me and the Playboy bunnies
Gonna be swimmin' in a pool of a paper like Scrooge McDuck
You're invited, if you can swim, rock on
