Sleepin' at the top, dreamin of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly til you swat â€˜em
But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin' roses
We in in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear ended
Pause! Like a red light, I'm dead right!
Highway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?
They say "you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it"
Well call me clueless cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star
Life is a course and I'mma shoot for Par
I'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back like I'll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money CMR, I'm Blood like a scar
I'm Weezy F baby and the F aint for "Flaw"

Yep, yeah, yep, yep

It's like I have it all
But I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way, like nothings my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail I would have f-cked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, than I hope you toss and turning
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask yo bitch she will confirm it
Yeah
Now what we doing with it
You keep opening ya grill, I'm barbequeing with it
I know my shit already tight so I aint screwing with it
Some say this shit is a joke well I hope they get it
Ok, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice I hope my son's choose wiser

And don't call me sir, call me survivor
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh, call me killer cause I make a killin
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
Thats them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly, like tinkerbell
But they all on my wire, like Stringer Bell
I let them be, cause you know how the sting'll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I f-ck up any track, train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, All or nothing, or nothing else

I bleed reality, I should cut myself

Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the F is for F-ck Yourself
Uh, yeah

And I aint doing nothin' but getting my share
Breathin' this air
And Mack mom's told me she gon keep me in her prayers
So I'm feeling alright I'm tryna stay aware

And if you wanna trip than I'mma meet ya there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer
I'm tryna keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F baby and the F aint for fear
Uhhh
