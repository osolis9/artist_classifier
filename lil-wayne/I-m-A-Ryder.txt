Ah haa
Who wee
Young weezy baby
Awwoo

I won't deny it, I'm a fuckin' ryder
You don't want to fuck with me
But I bet she gon' want to fuck with me
'Cause who wouldn't want to fuck with me

Now I can't tell you shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothin' on me
So baby, you should bury him
And just marry me, just marry me

Okay, I'm lookin' for a Redbone
And when I get her, I'm goin'
Tap it like a fed phone
And shawty talked about her man

She said tired of him
I said well, baby, I'm gonna have you
Tryin' to hide from him and if it's weezy
Then the women want to lie to him

And I'm gon' give it to em'
Mama said give it to em'
So I'm gon' give it to her
Just the way she want it

I said girl
I'm tryin' to put my name on it
I'm tryin' to own it
Welcome to my ranch and
I'm gon' act a donkey

From the mornin' till the night
Till the mornin'
And if you back it up
Then I'm gon' jump on it

I said I won't deny her
Shawty is a ryder
And she gon' ride for me
I said she lookin'
Like my bride to be

Take one knee, let me take one knee
And I said, baby, will you marry me
We'll live ever after happily
Just the way it's supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me

Yeah, shawty said she want a ryder
And I could be that it much
More like a provider
I can provide her
And if you lookin' for me

I'm prolly inside her
You only like her
I'm tryin' to wife her
See I'm a lighter
And shes my fire

See we are tighter
Than grip pliers
She gets me higher
Higher than my purp
Shawty so bright when you

Look at her make your eyes hurt
Better get a visor oh, yeah, she cold
Yeah, she cooler than an iceberg
Fuck, what you might heard
You only like her, I'm tryin' to wife her

I said, I won't deny her
Shawty is a ryder
And she gon' ride for me
I said she lookin'
Like my bride to be

Take one knee
Let me take one knee
And I said, baby, will you marry me
We'll live ever after happily
Just the way it's supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me
