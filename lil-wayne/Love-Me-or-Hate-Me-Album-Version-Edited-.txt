I been through it all
The fails the falls
Im like Niagra
But i got right back up like viagra
I am agriculture
Swagga so mean it might insult ya
(ha)Im like an ultravulture
I fk around and catapult ya
Torture, Thought ya parents taught ya
You guys is chocha im gone buenos noches
Flow scorch ya and ion even write
No author so harder so smarter
All about a dollar like 4 quarters
Oh father will tonight be my last
and if so make sure my kids see my cash
and i know im solid like an elbow cast
and my future will be better than my past
Weezy
You can love me or hate me
I swear it wont make me or break me
Im goin whereva da money take me
Until the funeral and wake me
And dont wake me cause Im sleepin Im dreamin
I know that there is a better way cause I've seen it Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
and i need it say i need it

C.A.R.T.E.R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleaver
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove one seven Eagle street
And Im higher than an eagle's feet but I believe in me
Apple is the car street
I am just the offspring
Born in the ghetto that's why I can't let go
One call will have my dawgs on ya like an echo
Baby I am the real deal no pickleSpit sickle cell physcho
I go off like a mutha fkin rifle
And I'm from the underground baby like a pipe hole
I will stand tall like a light poles until the light blows

You can love me or hate me
Baby I swear it wont make me or break me
And I be goin whereva da money take me
Until the funeral and wake me
And dont wake me cause Im sleepin and Im dreamin
See I'm just hustlin livin what I believe in dawg
And it's a problem when my homies not eatin
And I'm greedy I'm greedy

Share my blood feed my family
My flow'll have to plead insanity
So sick I need Grey's Anatomy
Acid like a bust open battery
I'm cool like LA nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Aye Juelz I swear the otha day i pissed Crystal
These bitches tryna kick it like June Tow
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just tryin ta stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floatin like a boat in the battle
Alligators and rattle snakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off like a Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icing like carrot cake
Different color diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alley way
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F Baby Great

I know they love me they hate me
But I'm a G it won't make me or break me
And you can find me whereva the money place me
(yea)Until you ridin to the late me
And don't wake me cause I'm sleepin and I'm dreamin
And me and my Lord got an agreement yall
And so I thank him everyday for my achievements
And I'm Weezy I'm Weezy
