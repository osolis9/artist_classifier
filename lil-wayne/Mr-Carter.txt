Yo
Yo joint Inf’ did this
This right here is crazy
Ya, I-I feel big, you-know…
Like not-not “big” in the sense of weight
You know like gaining weight or… nothing like that
Like colossal like you gonna be like **sigh**…
I heard you were looking for me

(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hello
(Tell me where have you been?)
Hahaha, you know! hahaha
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Yeah, aha I know! haha
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hey, hello
(Tell me where have you been?)
Shit, you know! hahaha
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Hahaha

Yeah
To you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody said “Judge I’mma need to sue”
I’mma need a Coupe, I wont need a roof
Flyer than Beetle juice, beetle juice, be-the-juice
I got the floor, I’m tryna see the roof
Didn’t wear a bulletproof
So I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes can look at me to see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do? But I’mma leave it to God
Not beaver neither you
Cause I’mma murder, why I kill O and even you
Man I got Summer hating on me cause I’m hotter than the sun
Got Spring hating on me cause I ain’t never sprung
Winter hating on me cause I’m colder than y’all
And I would never, I would never, I would never Fall
I’m being hated by the seasons
So fuck y’all who hating for no reason!

(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world and I’m back again
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who’s been asking about me? In case you’re wondering
Haa
(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world now I’m back again
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who’s been asking about me? In case you’re wondering
Haa

Yeah
I been in and out the bank bitch
While all y’all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush, and watch ‘em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: “Wayne Quit”
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call them April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze
We up, feet up like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic, I parallel park
In a red and yellow thang old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I’m from Collipark, but I’m from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream “Su Woo” and “Da da doe”
I know my role, and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
(Long hair, don’t even care)

Young!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world and now I’m back again
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who’s been asking about me? In case you’re wondering
(Hey Mr. Carter)
I am him
(Tell me where have you been?)
Around the world now I’m back again
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Who’s been asking about me? In case you’re wondering

Ch-yeah!
I’m right ch-ere, in my chair
With my crown, and my dear
Queen B, as I share
Mic time, with my heir
Young Carter, go farther
Go further, go harder
Is that not why we came?
And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielaga’s
I’m far from being the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name’s being mentioned with the Martyrs
The Biggie’s and the Pac’s, and the Marley’s and the Marcus’
Govi got me a Molotov Cocktail
Flow even if you box well
Can’t stop the blows, *Kaboom*
The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy just came off the spoon
Also, I’m so fly I’m on auto-pilot
While guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euro’s, that’s right plural
I took so much change from this rap game
It’s your go!
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Young!

It’s my go, yeah
And I’mma go so opposite of soft
Off the Richter, Hector, Camacho man Randy Savage
Far from average, above status
Quo, flow, so, pro
I know, I rise slow
And when I pass
They say “what up killer man?”, stop bringing up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie or Jay-Z
Don’t forget Weezy Baby

(Hey Mr. Carter)
Amen
(Tell me where have you been?)
Yeah
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Hahaha
(Hey Mr. Carter)
Amen
(Tell me where have you been?)
Hova
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Weezy… baaabbbyy

(Hey Mr. Carter)
Hahahah
(Tell me where you been?)
I been hustling…
(They been asking, they been searching, they been wondering why)
Hustling hard, ch-yeah
(Hey Mr. Carter)
And I swear to everything when I leave this Earth
(Tell me where you been?)
It’s gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
(They been asking, they been searching they been wondering why)
And you can try me fucker, but when I squeeze it hurt
Fine, we lose two lives
Yours and mine
Gimme any amount of time
Don’t let Mrs. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor
Dripping tears down my sleeve
Gimme any amount of time
Don’t let Mrs. Carter grieve…
