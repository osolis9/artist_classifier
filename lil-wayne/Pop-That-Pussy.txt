‘Bout to go pecans, I beat it like 3 hands
Weezy in the building, you other niggas freelance

Fuck with Young Money bitch nigga get hit up
Nigga fuck can't even fuck with us

Where the motherfucking beef gets deep fried nigga
Nigga couldn't see me with 3 eyes nigga
You's a bitch, No U-N-I-T-Y nigga
On the mic I'm like Pac, I'm like B-I nigga
Whoever don't agree come and see my nigga
I be waiting in my mansion, seaside nigga
Young motherfucking M-O-N-E-Y nigga
Hate no, hate no
I don't want to hate no, hate no
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
I don't want to hate nobody tonight

But they keep pushing me, pushing me
Everyday pushing me, pushing me
Pop that pussy and shake that ass

Cool N Dre, this is No Ceilings
I do this all day I got bars, no railings
Looking for a bitch with some sexual healing
Open up her mouth and she catch it like Braylon
Young Weezy F, the F is not for failing
Swagger just dumb, call it Sarah Palin
If you niggas fly then I must be parasailing
W-we are not the same, I'm a motherfucking alien
Back on my saddle with my tool in my hand
Uptown real nigga bitch landed in the sand
Back home nigga did it for the land
For the grand with the money with the tool in my hand
High life give a fuck about your stripes homie
Killer kill, kill a spend your been daily homie
Turn left get your switch turned off nigga
Turn right and get your shit took off nigga
Fuck, cause we higher than we ever been
More loaded, white doves, burning hundreds
Overseas nigga pitching on the top floor
High floor situation from the bottom floor
Born in the middle, shining like a diamond
Red diamonds, big diamonds how we roll nigga
24′s, fucking all these hoes nigga
High life getting money then we go nigga
I don't want to hate no, hate no
I don't want to hate no, hate no
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
I don't want to hate nobody tonight
I don't want to hate nobody tonight
But they keep pushing me, pushing me
Everyday pushing me, pushing me
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, legoo
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
I say pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
You gotta pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that
And No Ceilings
