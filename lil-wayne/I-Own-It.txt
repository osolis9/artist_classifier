Yeah, do it right!
Southern smoke, easy breath, baby!

Sisi boy, â€¦baby!

..fantasy, so Iâ€™m hotâ€¦
Canâ€™t love myâ€¦ Bugattiâ€¦
..24 hours, man, Iâ€™m 24 hour,
Brought it thereâ€¦ area
And I donâ€™t give a damn fuck!
The best of both worldsâ€¦
And never say never, you!
Iâ€™m fucking out the zone, all aloneâ€¦
The French mafia, â€¦
Transforms us monstersâ€¦

Chorus:
Tell me, tell me, I donâ€™t own my!

UK, tell me, tell me, I donâ€™t own my!

Good, cause Iâ€¦
I think Iâ€™m looking good,
Never been the damn sucker!

That mean I get the club jumping,
Iâ€™m dropping rappers here,
..I reply with ..
I let myâ€¦ so â€¦, cause all the rappers allâ€¦
Cause all the rappers fought me for being the best â€¦
Rappers canâ€™t hold me, cause Iâ€™m the best rapper!
Rappers you can call me, the best rapper!
Iâ€™m a dog, Iâ€™m a beastâ€¦,
Hard to get it in order, order me, I order â€¦
Cause Iâ€™m the bloody peasant â€¦
Iâ€™m a beast, at least you should get a piece of that pie before I die!
Because I am no one elseâ€¦
