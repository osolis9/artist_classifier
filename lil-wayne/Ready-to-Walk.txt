"I'm Ready"
oh yeah
oh yeah
baby
Reaching out with Open Arms,
Use to make you run before
I knock on your door,
But nobody's home
When did you change all the lights,
Her heart piano's is out of key,
Playing notes, but the wrong melodies,
Skipping, throwing us off
We're not singing love songs anymore
I'm ready to live without you,
Wake up to anybody else but you,
I'm ready to love again,
I swear it,
I'm so,
I'm ready to live without you,
Go through the tears
forgetting all about you,
I'm ready to love again,
I swear it,
I'm ready to live without you,
Ready to live without you,
Ready this time to lose you,
I'm a lose you,
But I'm so,
Ready to live without you,
Bed rooms burning by the clock,
Only if these ones could talk,
They'd tell me to leave,
Cause shes breaking free,
Free out the window,
Before,
All this time I stood right here,
The boredom I'm growing,
Is my bucket of tears,
And how can you say,
What's disintegrated to dust,
I'm ready to live without you,
Wake up to anybody else but you,
I'm ready to love again,
I swear it,
I'm so,
I'm ready to live without you,
Go through the tears
forgetting all about you,
I'm ready to love again,
I swear it,
I'm ready to live without you,
Ready to live without you,
Ready this time to lose you,
I'm a lose you,
But I'm so,
Ready to live without you,
You don't even care to turn this around,
We told each other no backing down,
How,
Can you stay when you walked away from me
Season's changing,
Time to turn the pages,
Heres where we become strangers,
So goodnight,
Goodluck,
Goodbye
I'm ready to live without you,
Wake up to anybody else but you,
I'm ready to love again,
I swear it,
I'm so,
I'm ready to live without you,
Go through the tears
forgetting all about you,
I'm ready to love again,
I swear it,
I'm ready to live without you,
Ready to live without you,
Ready this time to lose you,
I'm a lose you,
But I'm so,
Ready to live without you...
Ohh. Yeahh...
Ready to live without you
Ohh.
Yeahh...
Ready to live without you...
