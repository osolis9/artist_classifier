Spazzin' and blastin; blastin and rat- a- tattin
And naw I don’t cook em like potatoes I mash em
I don’t give a fuck bout your money or your fashion
Shots through the window where your brand new astin??
You get out tryin' to run now you just wit them bullets crashin'
Pine box niggas no crutches no cassin
No wheelchair just a two door long black wagon flowers on the side
And four wheels of steal.. I ain't neva scared and I ain't neva cared
So fuck what they doing over there.. I'm doin' it here
You nothing like me fuck boy don’t be outlandish
We gorillas in the mist you just some kung fo pandas
Sweet like fantas my blood is the same as bruce bantis that record on the cameras

Being broke is a foreign language to me like Spanish musically I direct thrillers call me john Landis
