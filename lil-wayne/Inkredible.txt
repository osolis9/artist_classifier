Da Truth's back, let's get to bidness
It's something unfamiliar, call it a foreign image
Paint heavily leaking, I guess it wasn't finished
Riding with something freaky, they tell me she the business

The chain clear, stones never cloudy
60 rats or better, nigga ask about me
Certified gangsta, please don't ever doubt me
Welcome to the streets, you can't get in without me

I'm presidential, Obama painted the Vogues black
Toping in the Chevy, top rollin' back
My life a motion picture, bitch, I ain't gotta act
I send 'em to your section, nigga hold that

It's raining scattered bullets, too late to run for cover
I drain 'em like Kobe then I evacuate to the gutter
On something that's pokey with looks and a trunk they'd like to stutter
I rank as the king of the city, it ain't gon' be another

Inkredible

I'm sending shots, it's happy hour
I shoot from close range, I'ma need a shower
Brains in the sink, body on the counter
Women and the kids, leave 'em how I found 'em

I'm a real nigga, stand still nigga
I cut ya face, have ya lookin' like Seal nigga
Then I pull ya card, then I deal with 'cha
Gamble with 'cha life, is this your lucky night?

My bitch so fucking right, every night I fuck her twice
Big boy money bitch, pocket's on Charlie Wise
Tatted up, I'm scarred for life, tell the cops I know all my rights
Got Choppas I don't mean Harley bikes, drop 'em like a bag of ice

Shades dark, flag bright, wallet chain, chrome horse
Hair to the fucking back, call that shit Rosa Parks
Dr. Carter man, I gave Hip-hop open heart
Young Money, baby AKA Noah's Ark

Inkredible

And I'm Noah
Young Mula, baby

My money long, my temper short
My car's foreign, my dick a boss
The guns new, the beef old
It's time to come through like never before

Liquid C4, look at me hoe
Look into my eyes, do you see a C.O?
I'm talking kilos, time to reload
Map fout ou deyo, shut the fuck up in Creole

Bitch, I'm paid up, get ya weight up
Pillow top back, realest shade up
I got them automatics so you know I'm automatic
All my auto's automatic, you know that's automatic

What you niggas wanna see? Don't get caught in the street
I got G's that'll wait for a quarter key, nigga
I'm living nigga, fuck the critics nigga
Shit is serious nigga, you hear the lyrics nigga
