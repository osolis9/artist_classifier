8X Ya-ey
Chiya!
Stacks on deck,
Stacks on deck,
Walk up to the dice game and match all bets.
We got gats on deck, gats on deck,
Pull up to your video and black on set.
If that boy talking go to that boy net,
Watch the white man fly the little black boy jet.
I'm richer then a bitch,
I got rats on deck.
I got stacks,
I-I-I got stacks,
I got sta-,
I got, I got,
Stacks on deck.
Why would I lie?
What do you expect, keep your expectations high.
And I'm back on deck,
I'm so Y-
O-U-N-G M-O-N-E-Y
I got stacks on deck.
Why would I lie?
What do you expect,
I'm so Y-
-O-U-N-G M-O-N-E-Y--O-U-N-G M-O-N-E-Y.
