Ay Wayne what a pay net
I know this bullshit that I'm hearing ain't true right
Ya feel me these niggaz out here picking bullshit
Over money nigga but you know what fuck a nigga
We gone keep grinding this shoe box is full

The only way we get it only way we know to get it

The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga

Well I'm a 17 nigga got that holly grove in me
It ain't coming to me so I gotta go get it
You ain't fucking with me I got the hottest flow nigga
There ain't nothing to see because I'm not in yo vision
On and I'm gone get fed up one day put lead up in the K
Come and hit up where you stay so
Baby momma betta get up out the way
'Cause the bullet got no heart and the trigger man crazy

Little man if a bigger man jumps through
Then I'm in the hood with the pump in the truck looking
But if you ain't in them cuts or on them benches
I'm a park the fucking truck and knock yo door off the henges
Yes wheezy baby flow off the henges
So off the tempo no pad or pencil well let me go
Back to what men do throwback Benz purple, throw back 22's bitch

The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga
The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga

Fuck you pay me and I can't stop please, what you crazy?
Man I'm a get it like the man on the chorus got my hand on a fortune
Bang at ya porches, bang at ya window, kidnap ya neighbors
Torture ya kinfolk and tell the cops I murder the infoer
Leave him on the precinct steps in a pillow
Niggaz wanna keep they breath then tell 'em get low

I got ten left in the tech so what they here fo
Nigga you ain't scaring nothin' weezy been a tiger
In the jungle since a cub with my paws in the mud
Yeah me and my paw in the mud interior mayback like what
Bitch nigga it's the Birdman and Birdman Jr
And he ain't got to his son a shoot ya blah

The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga
The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga

Homeboy you gotta know that avenue to get off a bag
Or two or you just passin' through true true
And we just passed the truth passin' through the streets
Of the murder capital where you think your own brothers after you
So you ain't got no other brother after you don't let the boys
In blue capture you 'cause they got pictures of me at it too

It's all fucked up Bossman Weezy get y'all touched up
Gat blacked your face like your run into a wall or something
It's cash money all or nothing it's Lil Wayne the reverend call it Sunday
The congregation know I come with nothing but leave with everything
I ain't come for nothing and the choir know I come with money
And y'all know I'm Stunnas youngin' like dat bitch

The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga
The only way we live it only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga
The only way we get it only way we know to get it
Off the block, off the clip, off the cain nigga
The way we live it is the only way we know to live it
On the grind tote a nine do your thang nigga
