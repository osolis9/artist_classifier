Chorus: x2
(Help)
I Need Somebody
(Help)
Not Just Anybody
(Help)
U Kno I Need Someone
(Help, Help, Help)

So Sick Need A Doc Yes
A Creature, Monster Like The Loch-ness
I Gets Hotter By The Tock, When I Sizzle To Death
I Just Tell The Clock "Wait Give Me A Sec"
In The Middle of The War, Where My Enemy At?
Imma Running This Shyt Like Eric Be Enemy Back

Cause Everytime I Hit A Track Im Like A Energy Pack
The Instrumentals Cryin Out
"Where The Sympathy At!?"
I Attack Before U Begin 2 React
Im From The Dirt Where The Beetles And John Leenen Be At
And Now These Niggas Lookin Yellow Like The Penalty Flag
Its Weezy Baby With This Hustle Til Infinity Yeahhh
Like Somebody Let The Dog Out The Kinnle And Ran
Who Ever Did It Was A Very Smart Woman Or Man
Cause Im Coming Like The Stomp Of Every Marchin Band
I Need Y'all 2 Arch Ya Hands
And Pray 4 Me
I Need
