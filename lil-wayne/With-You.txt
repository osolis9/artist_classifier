Shawty badder than a three year old
Keep playin' and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just sayin' with my love I could feed her soul
Two day getaway and we don't need our clothes

We at the pool and she lookin' like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she gettin' plenty mo'
She got Indian in her family, seminal
Me and shawty go together like chemicals

And she get mad when I call other woman hoes
You send a rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe

I whisper in her ear, then lick around her lobe
And when she check her watch, it's never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold

God damn, you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight it's moonlight and candles and shit

With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you and only you

I say damn I must be left 'cause you the best I ever seen right
Shawty put me on, you got me gone like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably tellin' that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the weddin' throwin' rice

Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are lookin' like the prototype
But see that I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice
Then shake it up and roll the dice

I'm crusin' on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for lovin', Ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I, I be on that lavender, I, I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

God damn, you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight it's moonlight and candles and shit

With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you and only you

Now she don't know about me but I'mma put her on it
And she ain't sure 'bout me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever

And shawty I'm with ya
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget ya
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

God damn, you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight it's moonlight and candles and shit

With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you and only you

God damn, you the shit
I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight

With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you, baby
With you and only you
