Dro fuck with me!
Live from the 504
it's Mr. Crazy Flow
Jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon, I glow
Even if ain't sunny, I glow
If it ain't about money, I go
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See, you can smell that I smoke
And yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water, yep, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the Squid
Lilly pad niggas, look at the monster
You don't want to crash like La La La Bamba
See it's me, Roney & Terry
And my new drop is berry watermelon plum
Just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper getting new bucks
And all you new rappers your just new lunch
Flow sick, so sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness
I get hotter by the tock
before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, "Gimme a sec!"
In the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm runnin' this bitch like Eric Bieniemy back
Cause everytime I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out, "Where the sympathy at?"
If you betting money, baby, him will be back
Whatever legends look like
fin'
I walked right in hip hop, like, "Where my dinner be at?"
I ate that and I was like, "Where my dinner be at?"
I hate that women lie, so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants. Quiet? Neither them that

A lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that
Let's do a pill, I can fuck you for an hour with that
And to the kids: drugs kill; I'm acknowledging that
But when I'm on the drugs, I don't have a problem with that
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers, bitch
And we aimin' right at your fucking collar, bitch
