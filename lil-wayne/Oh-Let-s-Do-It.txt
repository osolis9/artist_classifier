Uh, I got Young Money up, and now I got my feet up
Tune in this bitch tell my niggas throw them B’s up
Doing what the fuck I want, hate me all the fuck you want
Real niggas fuck with me and I don’t give a fuck who don’t
Lock the CEO up, and I’m the CEO fuck
Prison in February and I ain’t in no rush
Drink till I throw up, nigga roll more blunts
Ball so hard man I got to go pro once
Hit them with the shot gun, call that shit the stop button
Call me Doctor Carter, AKA young wild nigga
AKA no trial nigga, AK click clack bawl nigga
Fucking with the kid and you’ll be missing like Bilal nigga
Yeah haha, swagger stupid
Pack a Uzi, hundred clips nigga
That’s a movie, aim at your toupee
You sweet as Kool-Aid, crème Brule
I’m sharp as blue-ray, I fuck her today
Then she got to skate, Young Lupe
I hit the beat hard, Bobby Boucher
I keep them tools on me, get the screw face
Flowers for the dead, here’s a bouquet
LV’s nigga, on every suitcase
YM nigga, it’s a new day
We the champions, nigga hoo-ray
Yeah, hammer in the Louie duff
Take a nigga bitch she gave me brains until I knew enough
Bullet come too fast to adjust
I don’t give a fuck about my roof that much
So I put it in a trunk and then the Coupe sped up
Take the Chopper out the trunk and just shoot that up
I’m Weezy F and the F is for flame
Eat these rappers chef of the game
Shit on the track, shit on the train
Murder the beat, the beat was slain
Rest in peace, that’s a shame, he kill anybody song
Versatile as fuck, I switch it up like Dennis Rodman dome
No homo you rock and roll, rest in peace my Styrofoam
Now they won’t know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
Big money my pockets long, New Orleans I got my home
And they got my back pause, no homo, no maricon
Smoking on that private grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese, cheddar, mozzarella, provolone
Fuck her for an hour long, let her take a shower, gone
Sorry baby but I’m in my ‘I don’t want be bothered zone’
Yeaahh, you’re a groupie, get on your duty
Two women give me head, call that two faced
Bitch I’m too great
Take your food tray, I was born on doomsday
Uh, ai-ain’t no nigga like me
What’s up to my gang, big B’s like a Breitling
Take a nigga bitch she ride my dick like she cycling
Then she can’t walk, run, or jump like white men
Uh, fu-fuck you niggas want do
No Ceilings let the bullets rain on you
Weezy F, the F is for fuck what you going to do
Make you people mourn you
Haha, okay let’s do it
