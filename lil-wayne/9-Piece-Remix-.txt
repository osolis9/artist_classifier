[Rick Ross - Chorus]
I’m smoking dope, I’m on my cell phone
I’m selling dope, straight off the iPhone
he wanna quote, he talkin 9 zones
he bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Rick Ross - Verse 1]
Suave house, still independant
Distribution Mexican
He still sending
No contract, take my word
Send a hundred packs bitch
Them my birds
Shoe box, no shoes in ‘em
In the two seater, me and two women
No Def Jam, went solo
Took the custy’s prices so low

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
I’m smoking dope, I’m on my cell phone
I’m selling dope, straight off the iPhone
he wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
he bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls

[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]
It’s Lil Tunechi
Wattup doe?
I’m talking white girl, Marilyn Monroe
And I can get em for the sweet sixteen
Hard dope, call it HD Flat screen
Fuck outta here, yo shit water whip
You got that tan dope, look like a Florida bitch
Automatic leave em dead in the living room
Get it? Leave em dead in the Living room
Fuck all these niggas
And tell them bitches to kiss my ass
I put that pistol to his head
And tell that nigga to have a glass
Fuck you mean I’m talking keys like Ray Charles
Rack ‘em up, pool table full of 8 balls
Yeh

[Rick Chorus]
I’m smoking dope, I’m on my cell phone
I’m selling dope, straight off the iPhone
he wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
he bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
MJG bitch I got 8 balls
