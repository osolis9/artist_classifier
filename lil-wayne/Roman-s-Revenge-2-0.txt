I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
so far ahead, these bums is lagging
see me in that new thing, bums is gagging
I’m starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I’m starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzing
so f*** I look like getting back to a has-been
yeah, I said it, has-been
hang it up, flatscreen, haha, plasma
hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain’t got medicine
I got bars, sentencing
I’m a bad b****, I’m a c***
and I’ll kick that hoe, punt
forced trauma, blunt
you play the back, b****, I’m in the front
you need a job, this ain’t cutting it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain’t f***ing with
You li’l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
you outta work, I know it’s tough
but enough is enough

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

I eat your face off
You n****s sweet as pie like this is a bake off
I love Nicki’s curves, swing at the baseball
I beat your brakes off
H-H-Hi, I’m Tune’, salt in the wound
I’m up in this b****, pardon the goons
Throw dirt on the floor and get caught in the broom
I like a big wet p****with a fork and a spoon
I got money and the power
a woman in the shower
And she don’t want nothin’ but my johnson, Howard
Sour D’s and a swisher sweet, sweet and sour
You scared? Go to church, say your prayers, read a Bible
Huh, I don’t know what y’all on
Please, I go in like goin’
Drink drink in my hand with the world in the other
The uzi go brrrrrrr, stutter
Ha, life is a puzzle, jigsaw
All I do is win, my name should be Victor
Old a** rappers, I’m still the s***, old-ass Pampers
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Foie gras, I hear you ducks is quackin’
I’m just pluckin’ my ashes, I’ma puff it and pass it
I’m a f***in’ a**assin, you should jump in a casket

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for putting you b****es on?
is it my fault that all of you b****es gone?
shoulda sent a thank you note, you little ho
now I’ma wrap your coffin with a bow
“N-N-N-Nicki, she’s just mad ’cause you took the spot”
word, that b**** mad ’cause I took the spot?
Well, b****, if you ain’t sh-tting, then get off the pot
Got some n-ggas out in Brooklyn that’ll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got ‘em scared, shook, panicking
overseas, church, Vatican
you at a stand, still, mannequin
you wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I’m the motherf-cking boss, overwrite
and when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
now all my n-ggas gettin’ bucked, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi’s
raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
these b****es calling me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!)
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-Manning, Eli
These b****es calling me (Manning, Eli)
