Young Mullah, Baby
Buckle up sweetheart

Ya see, I could get in it like a car and drive it
I said, I could get in it like a car and drive it
And take the girl wherever her body desires

I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
I take her where she wanna go
I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
I take her to the end of the road

I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
And I take her where she wanna be
I'm the navigator man, check your navigation
And you'll find it right here with me

I'm the navigator man, I won't lead you on
What? It's like a navigation just leave me on
To the yellow brick road that runs through to ya soul
I got an easy pass, I ain't worried about the toll

Ha ha, long hair, don't care
Mr. Navigator man, baby, I could take you there
Weezy F no GPS
PS, I kiss north, south, east, west

I'm the navigator man, I won't lead you wrong
And if it's my turn, I put the blinkers on
No rush hour feather cation
You can call me Mr. Final Destination

And your man ain't a boss to me
Navigator man, you won't never get lost with me
So, tell your man, keep hatin'
'Cause he'll never find me 'cause he ain't go navigation

Now, I could get in it like a car and drive
I said, I could get in it like a car and drive
And if you want a rider, I could be much more like a provider
And if you want a rider, baby, I could be much more I'm a rider, baby

I said, Trace hook me up with a chick named Gena
And Gena hook me up with a chick named Tina
And Tina hook me up with a chick named Kema
And Kema hook me up with a chick named Fatina

Fatina she's a college girl that drives a black Beemer
And buy my polo white tees and take my clothes to the cleaners
She used to fuck with beaners but now she fuck with the boss
Her parents gave her bad directions and little girl is lost, but uh

I could be your on star, baby
I could be your GPS
I could keep you open 24 hours like CVS
Oh, we could make a movie on CBS
Without hesitation, I'll help ya reach your destination
That's only if you let me be you

I'm the navigator, man the navigator man
I take her where she wanna go
I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
I take her to the end of the road

I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
And I take her where she wanna be
I'm the navigator man, check your navigation
And you'll find it right here with me

I said, if you wanna go there, we could go there
If you wanna go there, we could go there

Are we there yet, huh? Are we there yet, huh? Are we there yet?
I could get in it like a car and drive
Baby you fly, can I be your pilot?
I could get in it like a car and drive it

Keep playin', I'ma bust your tires, you gotta trust your driver
And baby girl, I'm your driver and I know you say you wanna ride
Well, I won't deny ya, I'm a fuckin' rider

Baby, I could get in it like a car and drive it
I ain't gon' lie
I said, I could get in it like a car and drive it

And if you want a ride
I could be much more like a provider
I said, if you want a rider, baby
I could be much more like a provider, baby
I'm the navigator man

I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
I take her where she wanna go
I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
I take her to the end of the road

I'm the navigator man, the navigator man
And I take her where she wanna be
I'm the navigator man, check your navigation
And you'll find it right here with me

Young Mullah, baby
