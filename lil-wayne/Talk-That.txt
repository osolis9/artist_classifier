Talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'm a talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that spitting
If the haters keep hating, I'm a have to come and talk that shit

Happy ass Weezy, never in a bad mood
3boy I talk shit like I swallowed a bathroom
Girl give me vacuum, do it til her lips drool
The ice in your fridge never met a nigga this cool
Young money I'm richer than I used to be
I plant my seed in her garden now she root for me
Baby I'm a tell you truthfully
I talk it and I do believe I walk it, call me orthopedic
Carter and I ought to be an author
Damn, man and I tell ya, it'd be a best seller
Tim on the beat and me Miss-y-elli-OT goes wherever
Ya dig,
Ha, you can ask the bank teller
Bot my money old like Nelson Mandela
Ha, higher than a propellor
And baby I can show you better than acapella

Hey Shorty what you looking for, I bet I got it here
I'm in a Maybach, he in the cavalier
Now you can only talk cash here if you got cash
Let's have a conversation, we can talk about that
I'm a talk, talk, talk, talk
And I'm a talk, talk, talk, talk
Now go and give me 50 because when I talk that splitting
If the haters keep hating, I'm a have to come and talk that shit
