Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Uh, misunderstood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain (heh heh)
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow

Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swing

He had hair like wool, like Wayne (huh)
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, hail Mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry Mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My god is my judge, no gown no gavel
Uh, I'm a rebel, time to battle

Now or never, I would never, in the ever
Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree

I'm bright but I don't give a fuck if you see me

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Uh, what's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Tha Wayne
For eight and a half months I gave Ms. Cita pain
Now it's Young Money baby, keep the change
My momma say fuck 'em, and we the same
So hello motherfucker you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know church fit them outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this

What you about bitch?
Excuse my French emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion

What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula

But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Lil' Wayne is Weezy
But Weezy is Wayne

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I watched T.V. the other day right
Got this white guy on there talkin' 'bout black guys
Talkin' about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who
America
You see, one in every 100 Americans are locked up
One in every, 9 black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that

The money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail
A young motherfucker to jail
Would be less to send, his or her young ass to college (heh)
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers
You know crack, cocaine, yeah, stuff like that

Meanin' due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine
The police are only
I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs, because
Crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And um, you know the other thing is mostly found...
You know where I'm going
But why bring a motherfucker to jail

If it's not goin' stand up in court
Because this drug ain't that drug
You know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that (heh heh)
Mmm hmm, I guess it's all a misunderstanding, and um
I sit back and think well shit us young motherfuckers

You know, that 1 in every 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood
And it's not like the suburbs
We don't have the things that you have
Why? I really don't want to know the answer, but uh
I guess we just misunderstood uh, yeah
You know we don't have room in the jail
Now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know
Sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that
Don't get scared, don't get scared

I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mmm hmm
Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you
Sex offender on a level 3 drug, convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out

And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got?
Yeah, well you know what (coughing) that's the good weed
You know what? I have a fuckin' daughter
You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor
To jail just because the reason why he live next door to me
Ain't the reason why I live next door to him
Mean that, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood
He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
You move him out, bring him to jail for life
And then you move in a sex offender, heh heh heh
They givin' me a paper, heh heh

Is that a misunderstanding, 'cause I don't understand it
'Nother thing, let me take my glasses off
'Cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this

Uh, Mr. Al Sharpton, here's why I don't respect you
And nobody like you, hmm hmm, see
You're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, heh hehe
That's not good, no homo
And rather unhuman I should say
I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity rather
To me, is helpin' one another, no matter your color or race
But this guy, and people like him
They'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, heh heh
You know, 'spect before check, anyway
Mean that, I much rather you talk to me first and see if you
Can learn an opinion before you make one

Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton (heh heh)
Hold on, I ain't finished with you man
Gotta pluck the ashes, mmm hmm, hold on, um
Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me
So, if you're not goin' to try to, then what you say
Or think about me, or whatever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
To me, and, it doesn't make you a good person to
Criticize before you improvize
Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither but
The characteristics fall heavily into bad sway, hah hah
But since I am human, I am good and bad as well
But I try my hardest to stay good
And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good
But I do try
So with that said, I don't fault you, I mean, you're only human
Good or bad, but I also don't respect you
And I don't care if that's good or bad, heh heh
You see you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson
You a nobody, to me, you're just another Don King with a perm
Heh heh, just a little more political
And that just means you're a little unhuman than us humans
And now, let me be human by sayin' fuck Al Sharpton
And anyone like him, fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood, why?
'Cause I live in the suburbs but I come from the hood
Bring the in
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
