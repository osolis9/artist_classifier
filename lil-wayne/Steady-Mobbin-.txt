Man, fuck these niggas
I, I'ma spare everything but these niggas
I flip the gun and gun butt these niggas
Take the knife off the AK and cut these niggas

Yeah, and fuck these bitches
I swear I care about everything but these bitches
I, I don't care, I, so what? These bitches
And I put Young Mula baby, way above these bitches

If it ain't broke, don't break it
And if he ain't shook, I'm gon' shake him
Hope I don't look weak 'cause when a wolf cry wolf
You still see that wolf teeth, motherfucker

Futuristic handgun if you act foul
You get two shots and one
I'm at your face like man cum
You niggas softer then Rosanne's son

You cannot reach me on my Samsung
I'm busy fucking the world
And givin' the universe my damn tongue
Crazy motherfucker, I am one but the crazy thing is I began one

All white bricks I'm straight like it's
Jumpin' back to thirty-six nigga
Big house, long hallways
Got ten bathrooms, I can shit all day, nigga

And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, Big Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh

Now pop that pussy, I bring her to my bedroom
And pop that pussy, uh, huh and we be steady mobbin'
Oh, Kimosabe, big ballin' is my hobby

What the fuck is up? It's Gucci Maine the G
It's titty, boy, no pity, boy, big scarcity, the city boy
So Icy, so, no Nike boy, just Gucci Louis Prada 'scuse me
Gucci Maine keep shittin' on me, why that boy keep buyin' jewelry?

East Atlanta cockin' hammers
Bandannas on car antennas
No, we do not talk to strangers
Just cut off these niggas fingaz

Gucci's armed and dangerous
Cocaine, codeine and angel dust
This AK 47'll hit you
Everywhere from ankle up

Clip the size of Nia Long, clips long as a Pringles can
.45 Desert Eagle on me you'll think I'm an Eagles fan
Tony Braxton sniper rifle make you never breathe again
Fuck that nigga, kill that nigga, bring him back, kill him again, Gucci

Yeah, the money is the motive
Fuck with the money, it get ugly as coyote
Okay, I'm reloadin' better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down and put it in a stogie

Swagga so bright I don't even need light
I'm with a model broad, she don't even eat rice
But would you believe that she dykes
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her three strikes

I'm the man around this motherfucker
I'm so hot you probably catch a tan around this motherfucker
This rap game, I got my hand around this motherfucker
Yeah, I said game but I ain't playin' around this motherfucker

Yeah, I'm the best to ever do it bitch
And you the best at never doin' shit
If you the shit then I'm sewer rich
Try me and I'll have your people readin' eulogies

I swear you can't fuck with me
But I can fuck yo girl and make her nut for me
Then slut for me, then kill for me, then steal for me
And of course it'll be yo' cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to yo' ass

And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, Big Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga brains on the street, ooh

Now pop that pussy I bring her to my bedroom
And pop that pussy, uh, huh and we be steady mobbin'
Oh, Kimosabe, big ballin' is my hobby

Uh, man, suck my clip
Swallow my bullets and don't you spit
Uh, I am the hip hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I'm all about my poker chips

Do you want a dose of this? I will make the most of this
F is for ferocious, murder your associates
The top is so appropriate, this is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for yo' girlfriend to wobble on, Weezy

And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, Big Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga brains on the street, ooh

Now pop that pussy, I bring her to my bedroom
And pop that pussy, uh huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Oh, Kimosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
