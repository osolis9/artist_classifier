Welcome To Wayne's World 
Party Time excery
Higher than a bitch see young chris flying next to me
dont know were im goin 
no sense of directory
smokin on that shit you cant produce
historic to me lexure me about my high 
i dint wanna here it
tell me about the end
i may be near it but who's to say who's near it
you might be listing to a spirit
& yea i might be trippin
but i feel tarific
high feels tarific
you know me 
mr. 
soon to O.d Off
Mo-ney or Mo-Me
Mathufucker
i am the ultimite high
high till i walk up to the poped and fly

Chorus
Yea 
that mean im high till i die
why would i lie
& im high right now
i can die right now
