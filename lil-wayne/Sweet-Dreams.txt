Turn the lights off

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes

I'm going' outta my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands
And be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I
Don't wanna wake up from you

Sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your loves too good to be true

My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floatin' on air 'cause you're my

You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I
Don't wanna wake up from you

Yeah, Young Money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddie Kruger I'ma rap bitch nightmare

And I'm rich, I could buy you
Kill bitches leave ya body in a bayou
More brain than an IQ
More head than a dread

And my bank account ain't hardly empty
So I come through in a Barbie Bentley
But please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry

Who's next to go
My flows so flexible
Get gassed get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, plexico

White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but this is it
Born, born, born everywhere
You're like balloon boy mama, you was never there

I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all o' ya blogs, fuck all o' ya propaganda
Good for the goose then it's good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander

Please, you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn't even dare to be
So that's all folks, badibadee

I go hard pause
Hospital flow get more 'cause
I'ma bad bitch on all fours
The president be like it's all yours

Weezy and Nicki bring the a-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem in the ring, the queen and the king

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part

What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet dream

Kush it out, red bone pussy mouth
Eat you up, spit you out
Fuck your girl in your house

I'm terrible, be careful
You might wanna say a prayer or two
So cold, I need Theraflu
I'm so high, I need parachutes

I'm error proof, I'm never spooked
Got my crew, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell
Think your sweet as devils food

I never lose
My weapons use
Fuck with me wrong
Shit get ugly, Devin Dude

And she's the queen
Two's a couple, three's a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams
Get the pussy wet or be the springs

I'm Easter clean
Shout to my homegirl Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem
You niggas gassed up '93 supreme

Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch
More than an artist bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit
And walk around like she president Carter's bitch

She be on her Barbie shit
And me, I'm on the carter 6
And I can turn crumbs to bricks
And I can turn nuns to tricks

Young Mula, baby
Fuck your feelings
And this is 'No Ceilings'
Yeah

You could be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I
Don't wanna wake up from you

Sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your loves too good to be true

My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floatin' on air 'cause you're my

You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I
Don't wanna wake up from you

Either way I
Don't wanna wake up from you
