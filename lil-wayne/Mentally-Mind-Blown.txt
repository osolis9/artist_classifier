[Gudda Gudda:]
Mo money (uh), Mo bitches
Mo worth, Mo haters, equals mo snitches, yea
Mo digits, no, mo commas
Me affiliated with trendsetters, equals mo drama
Weezy Obama, dat-dats my co-signa
You see Osama, in-in my persona
Steamin like a sona, I'm sick I need a doctor,
Stab you before I drown you now you just another red lobster
Where da bitches at? I need a head doctor
Nice thick n red bitch you fuckin with a top shot-ta
T-t-top dolla, nigga young money
We got old money, don't play dumb money
All black whips, all red flags
Put that red dot on yo head, play head tag
Real niggas listen, when I'm preachin to em
Now we all noe money talks, cause I'm speakin to em

[Lil Wayne:]
Uh-Umm
But I ain't speaking to em
I call my guns jumpers cause my bullets just leaping to em
All you boys bustas, so soft, bet the wind blew em
I claim flame, I am just re-kin-dl-in
My in-tu-ition is get payed
But this glock will knock you back to 5th grade
I, school you niggas but none of yous get A's
Got a bitch who won't stop till everyone of us get laid
Lotta of you niggas are son of a bitch made
And if your girlfriend utter, I cut her like switch blade, yeaa
We ridin like roller blades
Now gon give me head till it fall off of your shoulders babe
I smoke a O all day, that's why I'm so away
Mentally mind blown now gon and blow away, yea
Ya'll niggas is super fake
I putchu niggas on mute, then I mutilate, yeaa
I Mac like the computer say
My hoes cooperate, I mean co-operate
I don't know how to say, oh but I gotta say
I just fo five away till ain't no one alive to say
That I fo five'd away, then I drive away
Paper chasin money runnin like andale
Better find a way, better not be in our way
I'll take your father than Zimbabwe
I make it harder for these wimps I stay on they neck no lettn up
And I tote that can opener don't make me bust your 7 up
Heaven up, hell down, man down, gal down
And I keep that hammer do you wanna get nailed down
Better kneel down, cause I am da god
I am da har-dest motherfucka to try it before
My diet is ya'll, I riot and war
Fightin dem all, bite'in dem all, giant or small, I am a dog,
I can smile at dum bitches and brighten dem all
I am a hog, ridin dem all
I just lay that pipe and I'm off
Call me plumber, and leave your girl my number, humber
I am a bumba, bee on a humble
Your girlfriend want my pickle and my cucumber
Tell your boyfriend I'll turn him to a vegetable
Break a nigga down to a decimal
I'm tellin you, I'm very cool, unless a fool, fuckin up my revenue
I tote that watever dude, I shoot at watever dude
Just bought a Lamborghini Murci-el-ago
And my girl from the bay said is hella cool
Wheres the helipad, my helicopter land
I shot the man, if I'm not the man, mhm
Do I go in, or I go in, I'm not your friend, I'm not your kin
I make your brain come out your chin
Been in the game since the begnning
I'm all about winning
I look down I see them, when I look up I don't see any
You pooh like Winnie, do I diddy
And I just left, but your boo right with me
And I'm from never do right city,
But don't get me wrong, Young Money I'm gooone
Yeaaa, Young Mulaa Baabbbyyyyy
