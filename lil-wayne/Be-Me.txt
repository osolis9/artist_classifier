Light that thing from the ass end baby
And I'm a take em all the way there boo
Hot spitta can I get em can I speak the truth

And I'm a take em all the way there boo
Mack maine can I bring em to tha carter 2 c'mon

[Verse 1:]
Ridin by myself, late nite, left arm on the steerin wheel, red light, Lookin thru the rear
View
Hoping I don't see the thirsty thief nor tha cop, u in the next lane hatin cause u couldn't afford the drop
Switch gears feet clutch, keep up, eat dust, try me, he bust
I don't giv a sista, brutha, fatha, motha fuck fuck? there goes the lawyers more bucks, but

[Chorus:]
I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll

I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll

[Verse 2:]
So wen u see me in tha streets don't speak
Cause I ain't even tryna holla if it's not about a dolla
See me straightening my collar lookin' good for the women
Putting good in dem phillys, blowin good on ya bitches
I go where eva the money take me
I'm there baby I'm faithfully on my job
No lady cause she don't understand
The way I gotta shine, thinking a niggas crazy
But the streets, they thinking I'm getting paid like baby
Who am I to tell em anything different I'm a make it
I get it just how I say it, gotta pay it how I weigh it
I'm only 145 soakin wet, butt naked and the scales don't lie
The food must be goin to my mind
Food for thought, I hope u eat 3 times
I'm a be here for a while if u don't like daddy cookin
Then u betta eat out, young money we out
If ya here leave out, if ya comin re-route, but

[Chorus:]
I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll

I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll

[Verse 3:]
Pops is no sucka moms a bit tougher
September 27th it wen heaven dropped a bundle
I rose to my feet then stumble
If I ain't come to get money then I can go back to where I come from
And leave with out a gun is a joke if I ever heard one
And scary niggas don't deserve one
I heard once, a fool and his money soon part wayz
So I'm a stay smart and stay paid like dat, (spitta) but

[Chorus:]
I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll

I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll

I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll

I'm just tryna be cool
But I'm a be me
And I'm a be real ya'll,
See I'm from the south and down here dawg
We don't fear ya'll we don't fear ya'll
