[verse: Lil' Wayne]
bang ,
the shooter name is Wayne
the victim didn`t complain
she just screamed 'shoot again'
i gave her extra rounds
my barrell twist around
i am mr. shoot 'em down
i leave hearts on the ground
my love is a weapon
and yes i use it well
then i let the rose petals
cover up the bullet shell
i never shoot and tell
i only shoot to kill
and that vest ain`t gonna help ya
even if it`s made of steel
my love is a revolver
do you wanna be my target ?
'cause i`m a sharp shooter
matter fact , i`m the sharpest
my aim is so flawless
girl you could be the farthest
i`mma still shoot my love
let me know that you caught it
i`m the triggerman i pull it
i will when he wouldn`t
do you wanna eat the bullet
and i know where to put it
it`s weezy f. baby
i`m shootin like the army
girl i should be illegal
betta put the safety on me
yeah
