Show em what you got baby
Show em you the shit
Go on throw it to the wall, somthing gonna stick, believe that
F-ck these other bitches don't trip
You've been working too hard, tell em n-ggas cut the check

I know you hustle baby I aint gotta tell ya
You can give it everything but they take it if you let em
But, bills don't stop so you keep the money coming
Cause you taking care of mama, lil brother, baby cousin
The way you move you're body girl you know your gonna get it
How the f-ck you else you going where the shoe ain't fitted?
Say hi to every hater, take a picture screen saver
Throw the middle finger, tell em bitches see ya later

Cause all that bullshit is smoke signals to the rider

Cause you know it's gon count baby if you gon give it
And know it aint a life if you don't live it, baby
