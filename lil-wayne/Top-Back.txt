Yeah, that's me and T man
T.I. dot com bitch
Tip, fuck wit' ya boi
Hey, that is my brotha
Ladies and gentleman T.I.

And he is the king, bitch
Don't get that shit twisted
And me, I am the best rapper alive
Ladies and gentleman, hello

This is the drought 3
And it's been a minute since
I rapped on a Manny Fresh beat
But uh, I guess I'll go ahead
And show these niggas what to do
With one of the beats, man

I like my seat down low and my window slightly cracked
Ridin' wit' a bad hoe with her girlfriend in tha back
I like to get real high and I never look back
And you don't wanna try me and don't I look strapped?

I come from tha hardest city, ain't nobody fuckin' wit' it
I got black and gold soul wit' a fresh New Orleans fitted
And a collared polo and a pair of balli bucks

Young Money motherfucka, I know you worry about us
Cash Money motherfucker, CMR, I trust
Never had my jaw brokin' but his jaw I'll bust
And I probably got your girlfriend on my bus

What happens on my bus stays on my bus
And that white widow weed out the jar is a must
If you give me a cigar then a cigar I'll bust
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff

Look ma, I'm tryin' to make a porno starring us
Well, not just us, a couple foreign sluts
Yeah, we make this a manage twain, ya'll in?
I be with Jim Jones and we be ballin' ballin'

Yeah baby, we ballin' like Rawlins and Spalding
Pint of DJ screw and that Hawaiian
I am leaning like 3 legged lion
Climbing right to the top
Of the motherfuckin' mountain counting

I'm gonna need me an accountant to count it
Manny got this fuckin' beat pounding
It's pounding but it was just lost until I found it
I found it, stole it like a scoundrel

Holly grove hound it, put this bitch to sleep
Fucking right, I night gowned it, nigga's talkin' cheap
Tell them niggas, pipe down bitch
Bloods in the building, now everybody soundless

Beatin' up this track like a motherfuckin round fist
Blind, deaf or crazy, I'ma spit like a long kiss
I'm just a martian, ain't nobody else on this planet I know

See, I live by my only
Say where my cheese nigga? Where my macaroni?
Baby, I get up in da ass and act a donkey
Candy, armed candy nigga grippin' the grain
See, I'm the only fire that can live in the rain
I am so, so New Orleans like 1825 Tulane

Ha, ha, ha, see you gotta be New Orleans
To know what I'm talkin 'bout and if you don't, fuck you
Say what I want and I don't want nothin'
'Cause I got everything, bitch
