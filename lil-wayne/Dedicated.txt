[Mack Mane Verse]
Young veteran, soon to be OG
Plus I spit like a crack head wit no teeth
I hear you lil niggaz barkin’, you want more beef
You like a nigga wit no guns, you gets no peace
And when it comes to money my shit is obese
Like delareece, I need celery
Mo’ money wat the f**k these niggaz tellin’ me
Im young Lucifer
Take um all to hell wit, Ya
Drop um off in a fire storm
Why young squad get a riot on
If he testify like common see the fire up on me
If you know whats best muthaf**ka get yo quite on
These niggaz starving out hit getting there diet on
While im eatin nigga grippin on my stereophon
One man game nigga ima die alone
For now im wit ya girl getttin my ride a ride pipa on

[Willie The Kid Verse]
Willie the kid pull guns like a hamstring
No bra I push pro v’s like Pantene
Blow like a trombone
Funny niggaz tambourine
Playaz get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine
Gators day, they say its mascara wear’as
And my niggaz on paper getting paper like ball playaz
No blood no foul, ya my heart cold is my scal
We NAPA kill like a hot towel
All my hoes hostile
Not me, never tell me not now
Rap niggaz forty cal tell ya bra
Move for mova
We leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch wit a moist chair
Seduce her, ya
You rappers should be tired of lyin’
But I know its hard like a tire iron
But yet it complex like its Mayan science
Or Aztec math
Crazy as a must have
I feed niggaz like a mess’ar
And yes shir,
Its Willie high dress’ar
Or like a stylist
Nobodies cry is this
You crazy, im getting brain like a psychiatrist

[Chorus]
And Ima Keep f**kin this word til ya muthaf**kaz come fo’ me (ya)
Don’t worry if I gotta gun, you should have a gun for me
And all these niggaz is killaz and all these killaz wit me
But you should be afraid of me

[Hook 2]
Cuz Ima kill um
Ima kill um
Ya ima kill um
Yes Ima kill um
And ima kill um

[Gudda Gudda Verse]
They say powder makes you hyper
Reafer makes you call’
Cigabutts give u castable
Booze make you dawg
While I sip the purple harlot
Think its my sudden draw
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave
Upside down blood rushin’ to they head
They reactin off a sound as I stand on the mound
Pitchin for the crown
Uptown ball face painted like a clown
Signs pictures from the chapters
Praverbs look levitachis
Old ass rappers complainin what the business is
Bouta state a hip
Soundin like some bitches have yo ass up off a rich nigga, dick
Its ridiculous the new school nigga
What you need to do is.........

[Hook 2]
Cuz Ima kill um
Ima kill um
Ya ima kill um
Yes Ima kill um
And ima kill um
Ima kill um
Ima kill ummummu

[Lil Wayne Verse]
Ya already, ya better call every paul barry in ya area the ball carria gon get popped
If I’m comin ‘round the block the in swing drive gets stopped
He gon drop like a flop
On the court I love sports
That’s why I play my b*tches cuz I got game
That’s why you pay my b*tches (Yaay)
Same hustle no money
Im just hip hop feelin’ two bunnies
Hoe run it, b*tch nigga muaaw
That was French, nigga not
A kiss, nigga na
No homo, rappers get ate like 4 on 4
They say I f**ked so and so
And I be like so, so and so
Nike’s on they neck, they like look me brave
Im sorry but I cant pisses how we feed
This is why we hot
This is how we fees
To fast to follow
This is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn’t why we Jeezy
This is how we shootin and this is how we leave
No return steal, this is how we easyin’
You can get the steal if you try these things now
Glass needa Swisha let me climb these trees
And im haters say we couldn’t this is why we bees
This shit like puddin’, puttin’ it down like gravitys pullin’
puttin’ it down like gravitys pullin’
puttin’ it down like gravitys pullin’ me to the ground
