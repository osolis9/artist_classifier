Haha, Young Moolah, baby
You already know
Cut the music up, mayne

Okay, money on my mind, fuck a nigga thoughts
He ain't even think
He ain't even see me with the pistol and the shank
Walked up to him, put the pistol to his tank

Pussy nigga faint, pick that pussy up, naw let 'em lay
Where I'm from, we see a fuckin' dead body everyday
Where I'm from, we see a fuckin' dead body everyday
Where I'm from, we see a fuckin' dead body everyday

Hammer'n the draws, hammer'n draws
And y'all ain't nuttin' but nails in the wall
Bolsters, holsters empty like a mufuka
Off my hip clip, empty like a mufuka

Hehe, okay, simply I'm a bug lover
It's fly carter duckin', a fly swatter
Simply I'm a mufuka pimpin' ain't dead
Because I'm pimpin' like a mufuka

Now where ya hoe at
Wipe ya feet on the doormat
I'm a bring the N.O. like a nigga with no bat
I'm a go forward the top and get lowered
Them hoes gon' get cut like a sword

I know it, you ain't gotta tell me
I already smell it you pussy niggas eatin' peanut butter
And jealous, you lost like and jealous
But you can find me in a white tan Ellis

Just like Van Halen, I'm a rock out bitch
I'm a wear that glock like a fuckin' outfit
I'ont care what you know, you don't know nuttin' 'bout this
And I hope ya ass choke when you suck on my dick Weezy

Okay, I'm strapped up, I'm strapped up
Downtown maniacs strait jackets and strapped up
And scrappin', we can do, see scrappin' what we do
And I'm like let me at 'em call me Scrappy Doo

Handle the scrap with you, I ain't lookin' stupid
You beat me too bad, bitch, I'm comin' back shootin'
Fool I'm a fool, I do what I do
It's like fixin' broke cars, which fuel I'm a use

The tech or the Uz, the mack of the rules
Catch it when it's just you, you like it wasn't just you
I guess I'm just too real for niggas to adjust to
Fuck me? Nah bend over nigga fuck you
See, I know what's what, who's who and who is you

Move ya lose, move a inch, another ligament you cud loose
I'll put you on the ten o clock news
1, 2, buckle ya shoes, here come the kid crew
Ooh, blood ooze will fill up ya whole food
Dude usin' more tools them tim from home improve

Then I play it cool smooth as James Brown shoes
Don't play with him 'cause shoot' he'll shoot
I'm loose as a goose on that goose
With them hoes, I'm playin' duck, duck goose
Boy slick like moose, I'm the truth nigga floose

I'm a murderer fuck moop, put niggas on mute like
Then I come back like good crack
I am that and get that I spit crack
6 shot by the 6-pack, I spit that where you spit at
I send niggas where ya kids at
Don't worry where the kid at nigga, huh

Uptown back in it, holly grove black menace
Black shirt, black tennis, black semi
I never sat in a Hemi that wud offend me
Try Maybach or Maybach

Bitch, I got stacks ya paychecks on paychecks
But I still won't payback, I still don't play that
I kill on ASAP
We don't do shit but get money all day
Put some tennis on my bullets now they runnin' yal way

Y.M. Young Mula, Young Money all day
Where girls so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of yal say ya want drama? I'm honered
Bitch yo ass like a muthafukin' llama

Stack of paycheck with a whole bunch of commas
Still wear red like a old 49er
Fuck shittin' on ya dump the whole toilet on ya
Weezy F. Baby, bitch, I'm hotta than Uganda
