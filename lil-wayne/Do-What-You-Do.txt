(Coppo, hold me up daddy)

Yea

And you can do what you wanna,
Cause I do me and I do it real
Well and yes I, I'm a get by and I'm a get
Mine so tell the haters I say that I'm doin
Jus fine [x2]

(I do me baby!)
Yea they try to get me when I'm no
Not lookin, but word to ma mama I'm cookin,
I'm jukin like o.J. simpson I'm innocent, grind
Even if I'm blind I'm a benefit,
And I'm smellin like a new box,
Of benjemines, black card and a gucci
Wallet Holla!, and I charge so much
It's a penalty and I travle so
Much it's a penalty, Ladies and gentleman what you gone do the gun fit in the timberland the timberland boot, and I'm so invisable, invisable to you, and you caint see me
And your see through, young money baby
Wats up with ya'll! if ya boi don't do nothin
He gone bring it back home, if the money don't move imms move till I get it, and let the sideline see me with it now time out!
We know the cops don't like us,
Because they wanna rock just like
Us and even if I new you since diapers
If your a cop now you are not just like
Us, I'm a ryder baby I wouldn't lie to you I prolly live for but I wouldn die for you, and I'm high to the point of too high, if a nigga come down it a be a suacide and the difference between
You and I, I'm a get ahead you gone get
Behind me and watch me do my thing and every day give all thanks to my king.
