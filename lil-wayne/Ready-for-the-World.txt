Oww!
When You Look into Tha Mirror in Tha Mornin Do You Recognize Who You See?
When I Look into Tha Mirror in Tha Mornin I Don't See Anything. What Happens When Tha
Sun Don't Rise And Tha Birds Don't Wanna Sing. And Even Tha Flowers For Tha Dead Die
And Then They Stink And Then They Shrink. And Even A Friend Of Mine Said?
And I Was Thinkin Bout Clearin My Mind but I'm Afraid That it Might Hurt (Uh)
And Just When it Seem Like I Got Tha Whole World At My Door. Tha Bell Ring And I Open
Up With A Rang.

Like Wait Till They Get A Load Of Me Like Wait Till They Get A Load Of Me

Psychotic My Pilot Left Tha Aircraft, Good Weed Like I'm Smokin On Some Tear Gas
How You Want it I Can Specify Motha Fuccah, Sneaker Scientist I Can Second Hide A Motha Fuccah
Pissed Off No More Like Shittin On, Get it Good bitch I Get Till Tha Gettin's Gone
3 Words Bitches, it is On. Big Dawg Are Tha Kittens Home?

When You Look into Tha Mirror in Tha Mornin Do You Recognize Who You See?
When I Look into Tha Mirror in Tha Mornin I Don't See Anything. What Happens When Tha
Sun Don't Rise And Tha Birds Don't Wanna Sing. And Even Tha Flowers For Tha Bees Die
And Then They Stink.
