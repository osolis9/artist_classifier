Wide receiver Weezy
Throw the pussy at me
Your pussy lips smiling
I make the pussy happy
Take your panties off
The pussy looking at me
I'm the pussy monster
Now get the pussy ready
I like to kiss
She like to kiss
I deep stroke
And make her bite her fist
The lights is on
The night is grown
We get it popping cause we know we can't when wifey home
California Kush strong as a Titan is what I'm lighten on
We get high as fuck and we just do it put your Nikes on
Tattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face
And if there's something she like to say, I let her say it on my microphone
She love my style
But that's expected
She coming back to you
The chance is anorexic
I knew she had it in her
So I got it out her
She give me neck around the clock, I call it round a collar
She rub my back
She say I'm tight
She cook fucking clean

And still make her flight

First class pussy

Crystal glass pussy

Ralph Lawrence spread
Lady in the streets
Porn star in bed
She like to fuck fight
So we spar in bed
She got that pink pussy
I beat it orange red
I fucked American pie
And I get foreign head
She sit down and ride

Like I'm a thoroughbred
She kiss mine
And I kiss hers back

If she's a bad bitch

She deserve that
She send me pictures to my iPhone
Then I gotta clear them cause my girl be checking my phone

I'm in the Bentley with the mind blown
When I'm in the pussy honey I'm home
You done been good
But you can do better

But I can get wetter
