Uh, rock star lifestyle might not make it
President got ‘em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it said right now
Get a pound break it down, blow it like a trial
Panetela Dutchy, wine in my tall glass
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti Matte black, where they do that at?
South beach Miami hoe, I’m probably with Tammy To
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose and I’m higher than Geronimo
And I got them tools, tell them boys to get mechanical
Now pop that pussy like a four-four
I turn her round and bend her over like a low blow
It’s Young Money baby, we the fucking greatest
We did put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat ya bitch with a pump if she denied data
Cause I’ll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I’ll make my girl cum first then I’ll arrive later
I shake you pussy’s up, I’m her vibrator haha
Keep getting money like hell yeah
This shits so good, it don’t even smell bad
And you can tell Dad, that I’m motherfucker
You niggas best not slip, ice road truckers
Lightpole barrel, chopper stupid long
New Orleans nigga, I get Super Dome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me
We on nigga, let-let them hoes know
Young Money lay them down like old folks
You coming with it, we coming for it
Plenty to go around, now watch the money orbit
Real shit people, now just absorb it
I try to pay attention but y’all mad boring
And I got so much swag, I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag so my bitches brag for me
Oh she a good girl, I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it global warming
If we don’t do it dog, let’s do it now
I am more animal then the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas little league, call them Curacao
Energizer money, it keep going
I’m laid up, I’m free throwing
Who rebounding, who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your misses
You are local news, I’m 60 minutes
I-I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office, guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still ice in our crosses, keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F Baby, the F is for Forensics
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
Okay you doing your thing, well things change
You plain Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch I bring the noise, where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It’s going down like the Catalina wine mixer
She going down like the hands on my time ticker
I’m always strapped, Vietnam nigga
We are fine nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes, I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
Young Money baby
And the building grows, as we look up
Where did the ceilings go?
Haha
No Ceilings!
