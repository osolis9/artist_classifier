I want to be the best
I want to be the best that ever played
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
That's what drives me

He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassins mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one
This guy is Hollywood

What separates Kobe from the pack?
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one

OK
Kobe doin work
24 (two-four) on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the 4th ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem!
24 (two-four) so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings,
Kobe in the game dunking on your team
Black Mamba, attack conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive in the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's going, it's going down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though
I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show

I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing

Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
and don't worry bout my shot
Cus I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work em like an auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cus I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with 3 seconds
And I bet we gone win it all in 3 seconds
Ya dig? That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team
Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let em get to me
Literally
Step back and give em a three
Ain't no defending me

One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately
LeBron James

I've been recorded saying that
He's definitely the best player in our League
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our League
And there's not another guy in our League
That can accomplish some of the things
that he's doing

Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
and get a J off
Baseline facetime
Tongue out like 23 (two-three)
Even 23 (two-three) gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
tha brackets aint for me
I will be jumping over you
Like i got a mattress at my feet
And all the Phil Jackson teams
Better be passing it to me
I put the master in the beast
Attack you like a beast
I am starving for victory
And that means ima eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me

Reporter: Who's the best player in the NBA?
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant.
Reporter: Really? Why?
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get

Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. automatic
I can post em up, or Lamar go get the ally
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want? They want Kobe
And what he want? He want the trophy
The victory
and the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break em off, Kobe break em off
You better be where that Laker dont
Yea, just give him the ball and he take it off
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cus I'm great, and so is my team, yeah

Do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothing wrong with doing it 4 times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now whats defense
To an assassin
Killer instinct
Murder the basket
Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a All-Star, been a Champion
Free throw line, you hear em chanting
MVP MVP
Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he cant guard me
He cant guard me

So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was - Kobe Bryant
