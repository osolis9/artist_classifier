Shining in this bitch, I got them bitches on my swizzag
 Swagger on Bruce Lee, kung fu, kickass
 Come through in a coupe, make that money hoola-hoop
 Triple OG kush, eyes low as Lucy Liu
 Got them hoes going crazy like now they goin west
 Got that chopper in the car stashed by the arm rest
 Put that light on me, it look right on me
 And tell them bitches they can get one night on me
 Tunechi be my name... but you already know that
 I already hit it: girl, that pussy throwback
 Weezy fucked the world: now how's that for romance?
 Weezy go Rocky, Rambo, Conan
 Diamond in the rough: light this motherfucka up
 Life in the fast lane: bitch, buckle up
 On "my life, my life, my life, my life" shit
 YMCMB, get the spotlight quick
