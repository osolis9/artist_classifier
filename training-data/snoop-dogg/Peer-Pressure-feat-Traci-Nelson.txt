Snoop, Snoopy doo, Snoop doo doo
Fredwreck, Snoop Dogg
Yeah, quit bullshittin' and hit it, man
Hit the shit, man, yeah

If I do, if I don't, if I will, if I won't
I mix the C with the P and live the G with the funk
Got you rappin' at school, my nigger actin' a fool
He got suspended, now he all alone in his room

Playin' my CD, la da dee da dee
East Side shit, Goldilock and big Trey D
On the C, the young homie wanna be me
So I'ma let him, I hope the homeboys don't get him
'Cause they gonna sweat him

Gotta stay on deck for that
If you a buster, you gonna get checked for that
It's so real, homie, don't pop that pill
Dip that now, tell me how does that feel?

I can't stop, gotta go hard in the paint
Can't fake, nigger, put paint where it ain't
Monkey see, monkey do what I say I do
If I take one, you take two

I just wanna let you ride, peer pressure
Get you high, peer pressure
Smoke weed till I die, peer pressure

I just wanna let you ride, peer pressure
Get you high, peer pressure
Smoke weed till I die, peer pressure
S-N-double O-P, I just wanna let you ride

Baby girl wanna be grown
Her daddy getting' money, her momma on the go
She movin' too fast but she really don't know

Life's a trip, lil' mama, don't drink that
They tellin' you it's cool, baby, don't take that
'Cause if you do, ain't no tellin'
You's a good girl, why you fightin' and rebellin'?

If you keep that up you gonna end up spread
Misled, better yet, sick in the head
So stop tryin' to be like them and be yourself
Stop, look and see yourself

It's so real, gotta stay hard in the paint
You can't fake, baby, put paint where it ain't
Monkey see, monkey do what I say I do
If I take one, you take two

I just wanna let you ride, peer pressure
Get you high, peer pressure
Smoke weed till I die, peer pressure

I just wanna let you ride, peer pressure
Get you high, peer pressure
Smoke weed till I die, peer pressure
S-N-double O-P, I just wanna let you ride

I love the street life, yeah, there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life 'cause there's no place I can go

I'm up all night like I'm on twilight
Turn left, turn right, your life, my life
Do wrong, do right, low life, high life
I go green, so why you keep offerin' me white?

Can't stop, gotta go hard in the paint
Can't fake, nigger, put paint where it ain't
Monkey see, monkey do what I say I do
If I take one, you take two

I just wanna let you ride, peer pressure
Get you high, peer pressure
Smoke weed till I die, peer pressure

I just wanna let you ride, peer pressure
Get you high, peer pressure
Smoke weed till I die, peer pressure
S-N-double O-P, I just wanna let you ride

Get you high, smoke weed till you die
I just wanna let you ride
Get you high, smoke weed till I die
I just wanna let you ride
I just wanna let you ride
