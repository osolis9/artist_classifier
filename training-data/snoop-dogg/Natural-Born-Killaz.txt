[Dr. Dre]
Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nut sack
I'm in a murderous mind-state
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, Lights out
Cause when I get my sawed off
Niggas get hauled off

*Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
*Barrel two
Shoots your fucking heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tec-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool its your bad time
Feel the blast of the chocolate bomber
Infra red aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitating I ain't hesitating
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
Its like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a 44 mag
And your frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I'm quick to blast motherfucker
(yeah what's up)
It feels like I'm busting a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm giving dirt naps
Coming with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse
Perhaps, you never sleep
Cause every time you doze
You catch blows to the motherfucking nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways ^in a fucked up maze^
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your living
I'm the unforgiving
Psycho driving
Murderer
Its authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God Damn it
Schizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out of his truck
Hit em with a brick
And I'm dancing

[RBX]
Mass Murderer, Natural Born Killla,
And I don't want to die
I don't want to DIE
I don't want to
I don't wanna die!

[Ice Cube]
I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sound of Sirens
Terrified screams from the streams
Of Strychnine
Dumping on any motherfucker trying to trick mine
Cause motherfuckers want to violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
It's so much pain
Migraine
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm a pull a fuckin Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana

[Dr. Dre]
Tic Toc
Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr Dre and Ice Cube on some murderous shit
Keeping niggas in order
Making there live shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life ain't worth a quarter
Or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallucination
Ain't no debating
I'm creating an escape
Route to be out without a doubt
Scot Free, so don't even think about trying to stop me
Cause I can't wait
I'm out the gate
On the for realla
A thrilla
Or a natural born killa

[Ice Cube]
They call me dadda
6 million ways to murder
Choose one
Lose one soul
Bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggas going bump in the night
