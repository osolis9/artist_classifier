What's My Name?
Snoop Doggy Dogg

From the depths of the sea, back to the block,
Snoop Doggy Dogg funky, yes, dub dub the dock.
Went solo on their ass but it's still the same,
Long Beach is the spot where I serve my cane.
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me,
But don't lose your grip.
Nine trizays, there is there for me to fuck up, shit.
So, I ain't holding nothing back,
And motherfucker I've got five on the twenty-sack.
It's like that, and as a matter of...
Rat tat tat tat,
Cause I never hesitate to put a nigger on his back.
Yeah, so bleap out the manuscript,
Cause seat it is must we drive game... for this shit.
What's my motherfucking name?

It's the bow to the wow,
Creaping and crawling, yiggy yes ya'lling,
Snoop Doggy Dogging in the motherfucking house like every day,
Dropping shit for my nigger Mr. DrDre.
Like I said, niggers can't fuck with this,
And niggers can't fuck with that.
Shit that I drop cause you know it don't stop,
Mr. 187 on the motherfucking cop,
Tick tock now I'd a glocked ya' some nuts and a cock.
Robbing motherfuckers then I kill them blood clots,
And I step through the fog and I creep through the smog,
Cause I'm Snoop Doggy... who? Doggy... Dah... Doggy... Dogg

Now just throw your hands in the motherfucking air,
And wave the motherfuckers like you just don't care... yeah.
Roll up the dank, and pour that drink, and watch your steak...
Why? Cause Doggy on the game.
My bank rolls on swoll.
My shit's on hit legit,
Now I'm on paroll, stroll.
With the Dogg Pound right behind me,
And up in your bitch is where you might find me.
Laying that, playing that G-thing.
She want the nigger with the biggest nuts, and guess what?
He is I and I am him,
Slim with the tilted brim;
What's my motherfucking name?
