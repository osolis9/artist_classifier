Get up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me that's a sin
I won't tear the sack up, punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role and the whole crew will act up

Get up, stand up, come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feelin' jump across the ceilin'
Muggs is a funk fest, someone's talkin' junk
Yo, I'll bust 'em in the eye and then I'll take the punks home

Feel it, funk it, amps it are junkin'
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that are dunkin'
Donuts shop, sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill
Plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seats and jump around

Jump around, jump up and get down
Jump around, jump around
Jump up and get down
Jump up, jump up and get down

Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smackin' the hoe
