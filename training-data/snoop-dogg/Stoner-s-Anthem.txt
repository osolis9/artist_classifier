A friend indeed
Feelin’like Cee Lo Green
Middle finger in the sky
Meditating let it ride rock’a'by baby bye
A friend indeed
More than Jimmy 2
More than giving you
No prohibs dude you can have all this
Until i couldn’t find no one else that i can give it to

And now that we own
I can put my family in a brand new home
My kids is grown
And I’m still rocking on the microphone
People love me everywhere and i know why
It’s not that i’m dope
My style is so fly
James Brown sat me down in a chair
And said “Snoopy don’t you ever cut your hair”
I was dazed and amazed
That’s why i keep my shit in pony tails and even braids
When I was in school i used to get cool grades
When I graduated I used to smoke 2 Js
With a fifth of ...groups

But then i got into… just like them vatos
Posted up 6 1
Yeah,that’s the block though
Ride by slow and get yo ass popped on
Me and …
Faith and cherry that’s what …
Can’t forget Tim
Baby dog ain’t half dead
Dre lo was a 20′s crip that showed me a lot of shit
I’m moving along
Went form my Camero to a Fleetwood Brougham
My sack in my back, my strap in my lap
Room to the back
Roaming through my neighborhood
Checking my tracks
As you get old life might get unfold
Can’t settle, this might be untold
Twilight zone, live life long
Smoke your bong and hit you a blunt
And buy you a zong
And roll you a j
And put it in the E i
And lets stay way fucked up till we D ie
All in together now, and if you agree
Lighters in the air and repeat after me
I too glow, forever in the day
I love for our soul
Does everybody agree it aint so
Everybody’s case, smoke like we smoke
Give a dog a bone
I like trees, the cyprus hill grow
Roll up this shit
Pimp and it’s gone
Stoners world wide singing this song

yeah

Straight Stoner’s Anthem
A lil something to smoke, too
Brought to you by DC Powder
And your boy Snoop Dogg
Be on the look out for that movie
High School
Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa
Ak devin nd mac
And the soundtrack, that’s wassup
