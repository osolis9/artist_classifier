Hard times and good times, when theyre mixed together
It can only make you stronger, even live a little longer
I see the Gs on the corner, holding steel, think theyre real
But oh, its only a short life
Pennies on their eyes cause they wont see tomorrow
Sometimes, I wanna run away, but Im holding on to what I feel
In this life, we dont crush no deals, back in the day
Back in the day, when I used to be a mindless kid
Now Im on that holy bid, no regrets for the things I did
Its the only way, only way, only way
To live with no regrets
You know youd better live with no regrets
You can roll up your problems, smoke em like a champion
You can pray for a miracle, and still nothing can happen
I aint never been sober, and Im a predictor of the future
But oh, its only a short life
Pennies on their eyes cause they wont see tomorrow
Sometimes, I wanna run away, but Im holding on to what I feel
In this life, we dont crush no deals, back in the day
Back in the day, when I used to be a mindless kid
Now Im on that holy bid, no regrets for the things I did
Its the only way, only way, only way
To live with no regrets
You know youd better live with no regrets
15 with kingpin, kilogram dreams, money talks
You aint talkin money, G,? Well we aint talkin bout a damn thing
Whip it til its hard, serve it to the dope fiend
Or bring me 21-5, get a whole thing
On triple-beams they weigh up
You owe me, homie? Best pay up
Dont make me raise this AK up
You and your homie get sprayed up
My lifestyle wild, he aint got a clue
Dont let this smile fool you, bruh, this what youd better do
Give me my respect
For I leave you doa you wont need no Doc
About my dog, I swear to god
I push that line with no regrets, I wont lose one nights sleep
Sometimes, I wanna run away, but Im holding on to what I feel
In this life, we dont crush no deals, back in the day
Back in the day, when I used to be a mindless kid
Now Im on that holy bid, no regrets for the things I did
Its the only way, only way, only way
To live with no regrets
You know youd better live with no regrets.
