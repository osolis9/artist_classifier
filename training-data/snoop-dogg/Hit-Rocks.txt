[Chorus:3X] 
Cuz were all a little strong 
In the beach where the papers long 
but as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks 

Now when I wake up in the morining 
and I get up out my bed 
I fell good, oh yes I do 
Cause I still can give it up for you {What up cuz} 

[Chorus] 
Cuz where all a little strong 
In the beach where the papers long 
but as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks {Dogg Pound} 

Cuz were all a little strong 
In the beach where the papers long 
but as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that} 

[Verse One:] 
You know you gotta have heart 
I told you niggas from the start 
If I'm still in it I'm in it for life 
Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight 
Cuz ever since elementary or was it pre school cool 
I was a muthafuckin fool 
I had to have papers it was routine 
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens 
I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas , shank theyselves 
For fuckin with my wealth 
and it'll catch on 
Cuz if it don't it's on 
and cuz I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone 
Sittin back laughin' in the chronic zone 
Clown me ya gone 
Surround me it's on 
and it's the same old song 
Niggas paper so long 
They call him Snoop Capone 
So if you want me, get me , got me 
Should of had shot him 
but now they call me Snoop Gotti 
and that's all I LBC betta yet 
That's all I DPGC 

[Chorus:2X

[Verse Two] 
I'm slappin bones 
Tryin to get some bones 
With some dogg pound gangstas in front of my home 
Bigg 6, bigg 5 3's with ya bitch 
My girls in the kitchen cookin up some fish 
I'm blastin at this nigga that was trippin 
Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin 
but I wasn't slippin I was on deck 
I blast his ass peck peck know his shirts wet 
Dead gone lights out 
With no remorse, I had to take him out 
I'm laughin at this shit cause it was funny 
Fuckin with the dogg I take your life and your money 
and now I dip too my spot 
and set up shop with yo rocks 
and bet nobody speak on the 8-7 
Cuz still all dogg go to heaven 
From my hood to your hood 
Game reconize it's all to the good 
So heres a toast to the indo 
Doing it like it's the thang to do 
I thought you knew

[Verse Three] 
Freestylin C-stylin 
Snoop and Pooh comin through fixin to take you to the island 
Where the bitches and the bud come free 
and everybody listen to the D-O double G 
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts 
People be lovin me because I drop cuts 
That makes sense and make big money 
See Snoop is that nigga who don't half to play funny 
but I got yo honey up under my wing 
Cuz she like that song that the bow wow sing 
I'll put her in a cling 
I won't buy her a ring 
but I'll put her on a hoe stroll make me 
and even if she never saw me befo 
Theres just no way that she can tell me no 
You know my game unbelievable baby 
and it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me 

**Snoop talking** 
You know what I'm sayin 
Is this the question that you have to ask 
Only the strong survive 
but you gotta ask the question 
See why the survivors Eastsidaz yea
