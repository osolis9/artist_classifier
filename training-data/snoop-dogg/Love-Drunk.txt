Ooh, ooh, close the door
I'ma goin' in and that fo' sure
Gonna lay ya out, out, out
And I know you love a nigga breakin' it down

Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo, I get her hoo, love drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, love drunk

You know who I am, I'm the mothafockin' Dogg
The sheets fucked up and you know it was me
You hit a bedspreak all way down the street
It sounds like a song we fuckin' to the beat

I put ma rat-tat-tat in her boom boom pow
Then she put her tit-tit-tit all up in my mouth
I told you before I don't love them ho's
But she got that good, good can't let 'r go and I gotta let 'r know

Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo, I get her hoo, love drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, love drunk

She make me say good love
That's what she's feelin' for
And I got that fire lovin'
The more you need the more

Ooh, lemme say
Ooh, ooh, aah, aah
Every time she's with me
Me, I'm dizzy

Shoot to the spot cause the spot is the lick
Pull your lunch break, lemme hit it real quick
Back to your job before they know what is
Lovin' so good, we already made three kids

I don't know what it is but I love what I did
Huggin' and touchin' and all that shit
Drink to your drunk, see my love is a fill
Yea, this for you boo, it's a gift

Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo , I get her hoo, love drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, love drunk

She make me say good love
That's what she's feelin' for
And I got that fire lovin'
The more you need the more

Ooh, lemme say
Ooh, ooh, aah, aah, oh, yeah
Every time she's with me
Me, I'm dizzy
