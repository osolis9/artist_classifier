WEST COAST!!!
It's time to stand up nigga
We gon unite around this mothafucca one time
I'm callin every real Crip nigga
And every real B-Dog, to the table right now
yeah, we gon push a real line right now
See if ya'll wit this real gangsta guerilla shit

Have you ever seen a hunned thousand rip rydaz from tha side
Blue chucc, blue rags, grey cloud, blue skies
on the move, can't lose, hell street blues
niggaz gotta pay they dues on the cruiser wit the uzi
spray deez suckaz then I cruize
my granny saw what on the news (what?)
she shook up, look up, and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
cuz the homies had to loot-loot that night
at King Park
and I got into a squab got caught, and went to jail
straight to the county with no muthaphukken bail
48 hunned wit this crippin, Oh Well
my bigg homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coat tail
he say "Trip dogg, you better get right, crip right,
eye'z open cuz niggaz get stucc on seezight"
It aint no mothaphukken problem
POP POP! TIC TOC! never flip flop, 20 crip until I drop

CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP!
SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT!
CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP!
SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT!
CA-RIP!

Is I? in the mothafuckin S5?
wit the red bandana double knotted around the rearview
niggaz see clear through they know that it's Game
cherry red Lowenharts let em know that I bang
so bang! like Snoop in Deep Cover
I got the seat reclined .45 under the white-T smothered
dippin down green leaf, I aint got no enemies
been shot 5 times, now I bleed hennessy
and bang for my niggaz locked up
they can't stop us
it aint a gangsta party til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Huey P. Newton with Air Force 1's on
I gang bang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo, Red Bandana print ceiling
Me and Snoop got the WestCoast locked
Red & Blue rag tied in a knot
but all my mothafuckin homies yellin out

SUWOOP! SUWOOP! SUWOOP! (BLUH'D)
SUWWOOP! (BLUH'D)
CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP!
SUWOOP! SUWOOP! SUWOOP! (BLUH'D)
SUWOOP! (BLUH'D)
CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP!

I ran out of gas in Long Beach I'm stuck
aint no Bloods and all I see is Blue Chucks
Hopped out tha six tray no where to go
til Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steelers '64
We just dippin One Blood and One Crippin'
I'm on that bullshit, throwback Scott Pippen
Moral is my bandana hangin from tha "Left Side"
so if you aint a crip or a blood just throw up "WestSide"
What up blood.

Yeah cuz we just tippin
Me and Game doin thangs switchin lanes
Hurricanes on my feet
Stop, and C-walk to tha beat
Game take the wheel and turn on 21st street (EASTSIIIDE!)
E/S L.B.C. gun in my hand it's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
we just slip and slide out, we rip and ride out
Let it C known, nigga welcome to da Thunderdome

CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP!
SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT!
CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP! CA-RIP!
SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT! SO WHOOOT!
