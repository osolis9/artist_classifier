Big Snoop Dogg
Can you be my doctor
Can you fix me up
Can you wipe me down
So I can
Make you give it up, Give it up
Til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey
Sh-ttin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can put me in
And never take me out
Til you can taste the win
Do it again and again
Til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat

Can you, can you get me up
Like I'm late for the first class
So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Fold you like a paper plane
You know 'bout that paper babe
But f-ck them dollar bills
Girl make it rain
Holiday Inn
Come meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good
but I feel bad for them maids though
And I, and I I apologize
But when I slip inside

I turn girls into slip n slides

I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat

I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat

I just wanna make you sweat

I'm gonna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat

Where you goin
Whatcha say
I want her river flowing to another lake
Another ocean another ocean

On the beach on the beach
Let let me
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat

I just wanna make you sweat

I'm gonna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat
I just wanna make you sweat
I'm gonna make you sweat
I just wanna make you swea
