[** feat. Wiz Khalifa:]


I wake up lonely in the morning and it feels so good*
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy in... please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of og under locking key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a... looking like a... tree
Please roll by I got nothing on me
Cause the smoke is already in the air
I am... two blades in my hair
I'll start with the kaki sweet
I'm gonna fuck around and take it to the classic suit
On the east side standing on the vip
Back when my only weed was the...
Used to... and you're looking so fine
I am sorry baby girl but tonight

[Chorus:]
This weed is mine
This weed is mine
You can't have it
This weed is mien

Get back to the episode sex...
Out of this world...
This church music listen to the...
To burn my kush you must use fire
Dogg like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like tic4
West coast... sea shore to sea shore
When is the last time you've seen the g in the g4
Don't worry I'll wait
Time is ticking I'm tripping
No sleeping I'll wait
Into the zone where these whores...
I... and they download my ring zone
And she is hypnotized by this pimp poem
What I got here is mien go get your own
I put this to rhymes get piece of mind
Oz to dye this weed is mine

[Chorus]

I hear niggers talking about what they want
And I smell what I smoke open up
Good chance if you see me down smoking one
Life used to get a fundamental shit
Real nigger... old enough
If I am in a building is hard not to notice it
... I got some whores to fuck
I am gonna fuck to... shit
Don't trip bitch... let you... mine
You supply your own little bit
My nigger et high and let the whores twist
Say you don't fuck with... how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like... cause they've be burning for hours
And if it's fine I am smocking the whole thing inside

[Chorus]

I got a roll for you
Do you wanna smoke with me
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me
[Repeat]
