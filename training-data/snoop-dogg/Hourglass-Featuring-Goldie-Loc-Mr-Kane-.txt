If ya doin' it wild in da club like a chicken with his head cut off, Lord
Let me rub up on that clit, it feels so nice and soft

Coast to coast we do-si-dos
And get your day started like a breakfast toast
Me and my niggas make beats for your strokes

With their noses flarin' out like they be on that coke

And rap crowns and mack downs
