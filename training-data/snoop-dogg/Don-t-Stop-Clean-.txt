And break a *** like a law, don't stop

My *** get yo' cash, don't stop
Oh, you keep the stash in the dash? Don't stop
Oh, you like to scrape and crawl? Don't stop
Well, we do it with no breaks at all, don't stop

They want me to stop 'cause I been goin' hard on them lately
And I feel raisin' my right hand sayin', "Motherf***, don't make me
Slap ya *** for not bringin' back the cash

West gang, *** I ain't gotta explain it to you, let's bang

Yeah, if you gettin' down to the sound, don't stop
If you gotta dump a few r***, don't stop
If some punk clown flags you down, don't stop
If you don't come from the town, don't stop

If you tryna hang with the gang, don't stop
If you makin' money tryna slang, don't stop
If the neighborhood's where you hang, don't stop
If bustin' s*** is yo' thang, don't stop

Look, what'chu tryna do, my ***?
E'rything you talkin' 'bout, I been through my ***
I'm original, busta I'm a D.P.G.
War Zone motherf*** in the midst of the streets

Geah, you get it and go
When the boys roll past, you're lettin' 'em know
H*** in the waistband, gang of tattoos
Compton, Eiht don't stop for you fools

Won't stop, learnt it on 'em, I gotta eat chief
Now getcha *** in my way, I'm snatchin' you up by your lil' briefs
Now rock twice and do your hand like this
If you not, then stop representin' this gangsta ***

So we bangs the clip, the main West G spot
Compton, Long Beach, S.E. Watts
Where *** is more sick, more dumb, more gone
Trick, you know where I'm from, the War Zone
