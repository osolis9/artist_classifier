You in the club lookin' grown with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend, let me stick it in

And not just the tip, I wanna give you all of it
She's a model, all tall and shit
I'm Too Short but I ain't got a small dick
Just ask around, I fucked a lot of hoes in this town
I get down, I come long and wide
And when I pull it out they all wanna ride

The sun's comin' up, we started at 4
I spit so much game, it's hard to absorb
And everythin' you believe, she hates
Like pimpin', she appreciate

'Cause my women have to understand the game
It's all about the money, give a fuck about the fame
You never get a chance to go out with me
If you a broke bitch and you're not a real freak

You in the club lookin' grown with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend, let me stick it in

You came with your friend but she fat as fuck
And now one of my homies wanna fuck
And now she wanna front
From the get go I figured this is how it gonna be
Tell that little punk bitch that you ride with me

Don't stop, fall hot
Hollywood Hills back to Too Short spot
You wanna roll, let's get ghost and jet
I wanna see if I can make you wet
'Cause you need it, let me beat it

Your little fat friend, actin' conceited
Sittin' in the corner, leave her the bitches a loner
Dancin' givin' me a boner, I pull the pole on out
Me and you, girl, we need to roll on out
You sat here in the bed where a nigger just wanna put the head in

You in the club lookin' grown with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend, let me stick it in

She wanna be my BFF
I'm on a time limit, got no time left
See I'm a mathematician, you can add the bed
Subtract your clothes then divide your legs

When it all equals out, you can moan a bit
She gave me the T, gave her the D instead
See, you a hot mess with that booty and thing, thing
Swingin' in the club when you drinkin' that drink, drink

Smoke in the air chillin' all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too Short, Snoop Dogg, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back

See, I just wanna hit it and stick it in
'Cause I don't wanna be your boyfriend
And you don't wanna be my girlfriend
I touched her once, you want me, say it again

You in the club lookin' grown with your sexy skirt on
Let me take you home, let me take you home
I'll make you scream and moan, you know that it's on
I can be your best friend, let me stick it in
