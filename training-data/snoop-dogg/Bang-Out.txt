Bang out, till the sun comes up
The wheels fall off in the parking lot
'Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand
While you posted up, chillin' wit cha mans

Bang out, won't catch me sleepin'
While you in the club, rollin' out the keys
'Cause I bang out, shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass butt naked while you wit ya bitch
'Cause I bang out

With some gold on my neck, yeah nigga

Then grab a hold of my dick

Ain't no need to try, can't stop my grind
Keep my pen in hand, go line from line
If you didn't know just press rewind, victory is mine

Bang out, till the sun comes up
The wheels fall off in the parking lot
'Cause I bang out, keep my glock in hand
While you posted up, chillin' wit cha mans

Bang out, won't catch me sleepin'
While you in the club, rollin' out the keys
'Cause I bang out, shots go off quick
Catch yo' ass butt naked while you wit ya bitch
