Watch your mouth never speak on what you not know,
im from the west coast I turn his face into a pothole,
15 deep n-ggaz creepin in da tahoe,
lets see you act macho when I pull the burner on you
sideways like a taco,
rap n-ggas we all talk like .
trunk full of cargo,
dry like Barstow,
arsenal run up on em,
get up on em,
drill em with the clips,
n-ggas gon respect mine,
i run this whole sh-t,
crip rag in my pocket, three eighty on my hip,
but back to this hip hop,
who next on the list,
gangstas dont kiss we get old and die rich,
i smoke till im sleep,
crush these n-ggas with my fist,
your daddy was a coward yous a son of a b-tch,
so back to the glock with the infra-blue clip,
we hit licks and gang bang,
you on some T-Pain sh-t,
chop the pop and 20 crip
watch the flame til its whip
then Im back to the block sh-t,
brack sh-t, hot sh-t,
hit em in the chest,
thug run up in his pockets,

mis-representing sock em in his eye socket,
i sat back and let you little n-ggas make your profits,
nonesense Im watching hoes out of pocket,
you heard what they say,
dont block it till you knock it,
you stole my whole style, im bout to take you fools hostage,
brrrah, bhrrrrah,
from the looks to the hooks,
im looking at these new n-ggas flicking through my book,
theres only one king, you a pawn or a rook,
I got hand machine guns and soldiers on foot,
so beef with me its none, n-gga done south huh (?)
I throw a bullet at ya who gon catch it n-gga duck,
then send the goons at ya, turn ya weapons into dust,
you against me its like trying to fight a bus,
Im at the BET awards sitting in disgust,
its still a G-thing but yet they wanna be us,
they wanna be Daz, they wanna be Kurrupt,
cash on delivery money up front,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
yeah bubble kush out a purple blunt,
whos the best n-gga circle one,
SNOOP DOGG,
im large in the streets,
my arms and my feets knee deep in the game,
Im the best on the beat, let you little n-gga speak
and run for a treat, muthaf-cking beast
all yall n-ggas owe me until you rest in peace,
and thats our dpg mutha f-cker,
thats real sh-t man, how the f-ck you gon keep having
these award shows out here on the west coast when aint
no mutha f-ckers from the west coast winning no awards,
n-gga, its like that, its just like that, we showed you
n-ggas how to do this sh-t.
