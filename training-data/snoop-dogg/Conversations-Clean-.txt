Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasin' fame and girls livin' they life on cruise control
But tell me, what do it profit a man
To gain a whole world livin' trife but then lose his soul?

I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreamin'
Kill every demon and snakes that make even Feds steamin'
Even though my star gleamin', man, my life ain't trouble-free
Homey, take it from me, Snoopy D O double G

It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leavin' to conclude that for them life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you peace of mind

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God, hey

So much drama on the ave, the coppers just laughed
Man, the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
'Cause out here, momma don't have and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own

And we struggle hard, suffer long, I'm feelin' like this life is a trip
Tryin' to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them that can endure it to the end and win

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God, yeah

Out here the only free psychiatrist, that's known throughout the world
Is fall in love by walks of all men and women, it's all boys and girls

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Whether it's soldiers on the cell block or homies on the run
With God, man, ain't no obstacles that you can't overcome

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

You're so frustrated, worryin' 'bout your bread
And some mornings, you don't even wanna get out the bed

When you lose too much too bad
Just go talk to God and pray

And you'se a good woman, but you can't understand
Why it seems like you ain't never gon' find yourself a good man

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God

Mothers on welfare or ladies that's strippin'
You under so much pressure, feel like your sanity's slippin'

When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
He'll never never let you down

You know that, don't you Snoop?
You know I know it, Uncle Steven
Oh I know that too, we know it
Yeah, we do

Thanks a lot, man
Nah, thank you, man, I appreciate that, you know I love you
And I love you for what you sayin'
God bless you

And you can catch me down on my knees, askin' the Lord please
Even G's pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There's disease, poverty and justice or oppression
I'm askin' for Your protection and thankin' You for Your blessing

Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates, now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin' too much
Now that's tabernacle, chuuch
