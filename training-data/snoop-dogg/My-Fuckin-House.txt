This is my fuckin' house, this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house

This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' house

This is my motherfuckin' house, eh, I'm by the front door
Hear about a blond haired bitch name Cisco
She'll do anythin' for daddy, man, the bitch go
Tell' em what the doormat read, baby, 'Big blow'

Uh, Pyrex and a DIJ scale
Fuck gloves, I got ya all in my fingernails
And I can leave a set of white fingerprints
Chris Tucker, Larenz Tate, Dead Presidents

Dead white boys spread across the coffee table
I don't know, maybe I'll start me up a record label
Fuck it, get high and call what's her name
She like to play this little game call fuck a brain

Lord, when you talk them numbers, sound sophisticated
It ain't nothin' even the Pitbull's affiliated
Yeah and trespassers getting' bust on
G shit even the Coupes got Chucks on

This is my fuckin' house, this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house

This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' house

I gotta whole house, trap house and a flat
I'm on parole, bitch, so I need my pistol back
These rap niggers is too soft
I built this from the ground up
Pound up until I knock your roof off

New boss, Snoop off and on
And heed him in the mornin', catch him while he yawnin'
My bitch is on the phone and my homies 'bout to zone in
Cracky, smacky, dippy, whippy, habitual, potential
Strip for your credentials

Mental, unessential, shit's official like a referee with a whistle
Nah, my nigger, shit's official, like a jihad Muslim with a missile
Catch me in the air, we close to the nickel block
Nigger went platinum but I still serve that nickel rock
Hard times, bad times, fuck doin' jail time
Cook it up, rock it up, bag it up and sell mines

This is my fuckin' house, this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house

This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' house

This is my house in the middle of the trap
Open this door, I'm sweatin' like I ran a fuckin' lap
Customers on hold, stressin' they keep comin' back
3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 7, I got Jumbo Jacks

Would you like your cheese with that?
Yeah, I like my cheese with that
Crack in the box round the clock
Open all night, pitchin' rocks

Servin' that doop, stuck in my loop
Pitchin' that tragic all in the traffic
Me and my group, me and my cabinet
Fillin' the coop, keep it and bag it

I got the key to this spot, break in, you gonna get popped
Fuck around and get molly whopped in here
Better not attract no cops
I got another round chopped up in her
Who want what I got in stock?
Not from Atlanta but I got heart

Chicken's birdies quails, bakin' soda scales
Heavy weights exhale 5 star hotels
I'm a grinder about my grit
Tryin' to increase my profit quick
50 thou' under the couch
This is my motherfuckin' house

This is my fuckin' house, this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house

This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' house

This is my fuckin' house, this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house

This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', this is my fuckin' house
This is my motherfuckin', this is my motherfuckin'
This is my motherfuckin', fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' house
