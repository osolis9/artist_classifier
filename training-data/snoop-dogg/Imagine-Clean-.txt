Yo Doc, what up my? Snoop Dogg, this what it is
This record is so motherf*** gangsta, man
And I think it's time for me and you
To just tone it down a bit, come on

Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin', imagine *** trapped
Imagine it havin' action
Imagine how *** could be actin'
If you never got this s*** crackin'

Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine, it's like livin' in the City of God
You feel me? Imagine life on the yard
Or tryin' get that dollar on some s*** ass job

Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' call pop 'bout one
Imagine a mother strugglin', dealin' with a system
That don't give a f*** about who shot her son

Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out the pen, you go right to the jenz
So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in

Imagine Russell still strugglin'
No Def Jam, just another *** hustlin'
And there no rocks on them fellaz
Just rocks on them fellaz, just tryna keep it bubblin'

Imagine *** dressed up
From the East to the West Coast, everybody *** up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know ***
Been blessed with hip hop

Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life

Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine bein' tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine *** at you when you done fo'

Remember how they asked you what you run for
And treat you like a ***?
When they kick you in your *** and take your s***?
We actin' like they hate to see you gung ho
But just imagine if the rappin' got the ***, no
But you already know

Imagine n*** in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg & D R E
And felt just like the *** in the 213
Then imagine that's what's comin' when you *** with me

Imagine you was up on top of this s***
Imagine if the *** could stay off this ***
I mean imagine we said *** this s***
Imagine if my *** got together and tow up this ***, yeah

You can't imagine growin' up in the jail, dunn
Happy just to be alive' watchin' all your people run
But you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records worldwide
Or *** off somebody's son

Imagine if these *** never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where *** kill each other?
All the drunk fool get is *** on ***
He *** off my niggaz, they gon' murder us all, imagine that

Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life

Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom, can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky, can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life

Imagine, imagine
Can you imagine? Can you imagine?
Can you imagine? Imagine, imagine

In the name of Allah, in the name of God
The benificiant, the merciful
The one God to whom all praises due
Regardless of land labor, of title

No matter what name you call God by
Whenever life seems hard
Everybody know that you must talk to God
