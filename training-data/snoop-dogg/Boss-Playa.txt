Boss Playa, Boss Playa
Big Snoop Dogg is a Boss Playa
This is the archbishop, Don Magic Juan
Skin and game, cheah

Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
And to me you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played

Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
(Go ahead)
Okay son, I'll tell ya like my nigga 'Pootie Tang'
I got that bounce to make her booty swang
That little cutie thang, 'fraid, she's a beauty bang

Rollin' with a player 'cause that's what he was
And dedicated to his paper, Jesus
On his bitches
(Hard as feeds, fuck)
And if them law boys pull him over, he won't freeze up

He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
With a pocket full of big faced visas
They say it's cheaper to keep her, now, baby, ease up
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up

Now sit your ass in the treesa
And do me a favor and turn the music up
Should I slap her or should I freak her
I'll take the stronga, you can have the weaka

Speak when spoken to, yeah, I broke a few
And by the way I was hoping you
Had a freak for me and a freak for you, I make 'em do for us
The thang you been wantin' her to do for months

Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
And to me you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played

Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
(Go ahead)
Okay son, I'll tell ya like my nigga 'Pootie Tang'
I got that bounce to make her booty swang
That little cutie thang, 'fraid, she's a beauty bang

This is the Chairman of the Board
The archbishop, Don Magic Juan
Big Snoop Dogg is a boss playa, as a matter a fact
I was there when he was crowned 'Boss Playa', cheah

I had three on my right arm and four on my left
Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death
Had to catch my breath, watch my step
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref

And call a timeout before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the 'Wizard Of Oz'
And tell 'em that you're tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart

A brand new start
'Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart, it's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state

See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it, homie, I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape
I say a prayer to the Lord, just to keep my faith, fuck straight

Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
And to me you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played

Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
(Go ahead)
Okay son, I'll tell ya like my nigga 'Pootie Tang'
I got that bounce to make her booty swang
That little cutie thang, 'fraid, she's a beauty bang

Will you steal for me?
(Yes, I will)
Will you kill for me?
(Yes, I will)
Would you lie to me?
(Never)
Would you die for me?
(Whenever)

Will you steal for me?
(Yes, I will)
Will you kill for me?
(Yes, I will)
Would you lie to me?
(Never)
Would you die for me?
(Whenever, whenever)

Big Snoop Dogg lets you know that this game ain't for no lame
If you got heart, you can play this game
But if your heart ain't right
We got a remedy for that too

You gotta go, see the wizard to get you some heart
And the archbishop, Don Magic Juan is the Wizard
That's got the game for them lame, Boss Playa, Boss Playa
That's what this gang is all about, Boss Playa

Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game
(Pimp game)
And to me you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played

Gangsta, gangsta, where you been?
Round the corner messin' with brothanem
Youngsta, youngsta, you at it again?
Poppin' gats for the fuck of it when you know you got ends

I don't think that you should be in the streets like that
You know you the fashion type of cat
Always in them stores with major whores doin' things, bling bling
West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin' smokin', always chokin' in the green

With the sticky in yo hand fo sho
Everybody round ya 'cause they know you got mo'
Wet Cristal, you like to get wild, you like to dip in yo sexy shit
Rollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT, L.B.C. rollin' with me, ohh
