Man, you got me goin' crazy, baby
I'm losin' my mind

Feels like I'm losin' control and I don't even know
Girl you hurt me, oh so, bad 'cause I love you so, hey
But it don't matter, now, bitch, I'm doin' better, now
Whatever you do, yeah whatever, will come back to you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

Now, who would ever think that I wanted her home?
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin' somethin' on the side? It didn't make sense

I'm a family man sportin' a wedding band
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, 'cause we gone make it through

The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker,
"Don't worry about what the fuck I be doin'"
We was makin' chemistry, but who is he?
And how this nigga know the deal about you and me?

I fell to my knees and asked the girl, "Why?"
She looked at my eyes with no reply
So I cried, I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

Feels like I'm losin' control and I don't even know
Girl you hurt me, oh so, bad 'cause I love you so, hey
  (I ain't loosin' you)
But it don't matter, now, I'm doin' better, now, cool
  (No, no, you could have my keys, take it)
Whatever you do, yeah, whatever, will come back to you
  (Hey, you have all that shit)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes

I was in love at times
They say game don't wait, ha Warren G?
Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin' my time while I'm writin' these rhymes

In the Hills for real, sippin' wines
Girl, you'z a dime, got me losin' my mind
Well, if lovin' you is a crime, I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key

I once told that "This was the way love was meant to be"
I see you with me forever, we can do things that you never
Thought you could've, up out the hood
Is where I took you, never overlooked you

I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin' to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

Feels like I'm losin' control and I don't even know
  (Take you for granted, shee, I'm cold now)
Girl you hurt me, oh so, bad 'cause I love you so, hey
  (What goes around comes around)
But it don't matter, now, I'm doin' better, now
Whatever you do, bitch, will come back to you, bitch

Hey, hey
  (I was in love at times)
Hey, hey
  (I was in love at times)
Hey, hey
  (I was in love at times)
Hey, hey
  (I was in love at times)
Hey

You know what girl?
I was in love with you and you did me like that
But you know what they say?
What goes around comes around

How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin' up my songs, now, a nigga must move on
Gave love, and you just, straight played on me
Had a nigga sick for weeks, now, I must begin my streak

I was in love at times
