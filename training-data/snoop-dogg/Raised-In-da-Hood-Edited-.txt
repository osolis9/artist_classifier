I was raised in the hood
(East side Long Beach, to be exact)
I was raised in the hood
(Where the grass is greener and the Crips are much meaner)
We got your back

I was raised in the hood
(I'll never turn my back on the hood, yeah)
I was raised in the hood
(You can take me out the hood)
(But you can't take the hood up outta me, you, dig?)
We got your back

Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves
The twins, yeah, I'm stealin' niggas, please
What you know 'bout that, I do it every time
Told 'em 1800 had 'em mixin' it with lime

Oh wee, my life is like a movie
I was thuggin' in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime and I held my first Uzi

Bitch, choose me 'cause I'm goin' to the top
Rap or the rock
Them hoes think I'm on, bitch, whenever will it stop?
I was poppin' like it's on, slammin' Chevy's up the block

East up, what it do though, now I ride 2 door
The Porsche lookin' mean, I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke
Plus a niggas still elope only 'cause I was

I was raised in the hood
I was raised in the hood
(We got your back)
I was raised in the hood
I was raised in the hood
(We got your back)

Raised by the monsters, the criminals, the G's
It was plain he had the niggas on the east
What you know 'bout that, Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss
I catch a nigga slippin' like moss

Ride with the realest, I've been on it since a young
And it's 200 bitches in the function
Lookin' cool, you know it, bitchy, I'm rollin'
And I ain't worried 'bout them niggas, we patrollin'

The hood and the city, rollin' on that dilly
2 Millys, 2 Bugattis, call 'em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, homie, I'm a vet
Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around, I'm a rep

East up, what it do though, hoes spillin' Nuvo
Doggy on his tip, I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke
Plus a niggas still elope only 'cause I was

I was raised in the hood
I was raised in the hood
We got your back
I was raised in the hood
I was raised in the hood
We got your back

Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them niggas on the spot
What you know 'bout that, turned up fully
The hood raised me, gang bangin' made me a bully, ya dig?

Burnt out
And any party we at, you know it's turned out
The people talkin' the rumors, now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou' gettin' purped out?

, I'm strapped up
I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets 'cuz
Like I don't come from the dub, yeah, I'm a beast, bru

What it do though, dickies for the dulo
Homie, you know skinny niggas sumo
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke
Plus a niggas still elope, only 'cause I was

I was raised in the hood
I was raised in the hood
We got your back
I was raised in the hood
I was raised in the hood
We got your back

I was raised in the hood

We got your back
