Motherfuckin place at the same aint nuttin but a gangsta party
Motherfuckin time, hahahahah
Yall niggaz about to feel this aint nuttin but a gangsta party
Break out the champagne glasses
And them motherfuckin condoms
Have one on us aight?? aint nuttin but a gangsta party
Verse one: 2pac, snoop
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intentions to get richer
With the s-n double-o-p, dogg my fuckin homey
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs
Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun, cuz they got me on the run
Now Im back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free tupac, is all thats on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin to take mine
So ima get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shits about to go down
Uhh, me and snoop about to clown
Im losin my religion, Im vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the grooves missin
Niggaz be actin like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nuthin but love, for my niggaz livin lavish
I got a pit named p, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to chino
And i, think I got a black beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like bugsy seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the gs and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the west side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dying for years, so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these, motherfuckin gs
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant
2 of amerikaz most wanted
Chorus:
Aint nuttin but a gangsta party
Aint nuttin but a gangsta party
(tupac) nuthin but a gangsta party... aint nuttin but a gangsta party
Nuthin but a gangsta party

Motherfuckin gangsta party aint nuttin but a gangsta party
Nuthin but a gangsta party
It aint nuthin but a
Motherfuckin gangsta party aint nuttin but a gangsta party
Verse two: 2pac, snoop
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatevers left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you try to fuck wit me
I bust a flea, these niggaz must be crazy what??
There aint no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the thugs
(hahah right) you thought it was but it wasnt, now dissapear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
Its like cuz, blood, gangbanging
Everybody in the party doing dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the guns kids
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throat of rage
Floatin in the black benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Keep a promise see if youre related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, try to get up on it
My nigga dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Chorus
