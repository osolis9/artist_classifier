Ohh, ohh, oh, ohh, ohh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, oh, ohh, ohh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop shit
Come on baby boo, you gotta get into it
Don't fool wit the playa with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit

Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, lemme put you in the mood and
Lil' cutie lookin' like a student
Long hair, wit'cha big fat booty

Back in the days you was a girl, I went to school wit
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl, wanna do it, I just might do it
Here to walk wit some pimp-pimp clue wit'
Mommy don't worry, I won't abuse it

Hurry up and finish so we can watch 'Clueless'
(Oh, hoo)
But everybody know who girl that you is
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it

I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow 'dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue
And have them hydralics squeakin' when we screwin'

Now she's yellin', hollerin' out Snoop
And hootin', hollerin', hollerin', hootin'
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long and black and curly like you're Cuban

Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in
Ohh, ohh, oh, ohh, ohh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ohh, ohh, oh, ohh, ohh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're my favorite girl
See I just want you to know
That you are really special

Ohh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
See I just want you to know
That you are really special
Ohh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in

You got my pictures on the wall in your room-in
Girls be complainin' you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you-in

You don't ask why I roll wit a crew, and
Twist up my fingers and wear dark blue-in
On the East side, that's the crew I choose
Nothin' I do is new to you

I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl you so beautiful
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
See I just want you to know
That you are really special
Ohh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
See I just want you to know
That you are really special
Ohh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
See I just want you to know
That you are really special
Ohh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
See I just want you to know
That you are really special
Ohh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
Ehh, oh yeah, there's something about you, oh, hoo
