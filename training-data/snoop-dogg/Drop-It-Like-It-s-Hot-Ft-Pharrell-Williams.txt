Snoop, Snoop

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot

An' if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot

I got the Rolly on my arm an' I'm pourin' Chandon
An' I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on

I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat

The Phantom exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead

Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street
Wit the steel that'll make you feel
Like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryin' to ask me shit

When my niggaz fill ya vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second
Matter 'fact, you should take four, B
An' think before you fuck wit lil' skateboard, P

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot

An' if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot

I got the Rolly on my arm an' I'm pourin' Chandon
An' I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on

I'm a gangsta but y'all knew that
Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side

Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ
Two, one, yep, three
S N double O P, D O double G

I can't fake it, just break it an' when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live

So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the pizzle, the dizzle an' the shizzle
Gs to the bizzack, now ladies, here we gizzo

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot

An' if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot

I got the Rolly on my arm an' I'm pourin' Chandon
An' I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on

I'm a Bad Boy wit a lotta hoes
Drive my own cars an' wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp

On the TV screen an' in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun ,so you wanna pop back?
AK 47, now nigga, stop that

C mid shoes, now I'm on the move
You're family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you an' now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you

Pistol whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this motherfuckin' music, we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get yo' issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot

When the pigs try to get at ya
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot

An' if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot

I got the Rolly on my arm an' I'm pourin' Chandon
An' I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on
