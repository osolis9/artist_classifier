Yo, Doc, what up my nigga?
Snoop Dogg, this what it is, man
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta, man
And I think it's time for me and you to just
Tone it down a bit
Come on

Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin'
Imagine niggas trapped
Imagine it havin' action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin'
If you never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in city of god
You feel me
Imagine life on the yard
I'm tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty-ass job
Imagine with his son
Imagine gettin' call pop 'bout one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just antoher nigga hustlin'
And no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas
Just try and keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas dressed up
From the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination
To know niggas been blessed with
Hip-hop

'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on

Before we go
Can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Oh lord mercy, I've been dreamin' all my life

Could you imagine bein' lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
We actin' like they hate to see you gun ho
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg & D-R-E
And felt just like the niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggas got together and tow up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run
Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' off somebodies son
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other
All the drunk fool get us pissed on balls
He fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving
Off and on
Eminem is on
Off and on
Dr. Dre is on

Before we go
Can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life
