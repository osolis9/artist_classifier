'Cuz I still can give it up on yizoo
'Cuz what is all I look fizzor
In the fizee where the papers lizzone
But as for mizee, I own gizees
(What)

When I'm bustin' rizzocks and ya know that
(Ticky, ticky, ticky, ticky, ticky)
I put down more hits than mafioso niggaz
And Lucky Luciano 'bout to sing soprano

And I know, I know the way it feels
And Baby Bubba we gon keep it on the real
Just to getcha caught up in amazement
(Yeah, what)

We talkin' to Cubans, so it might get dangerous
Now when it izzoo, people said oh dizzamn
And let the bizzow wizzow ride the trizail, ha ha
How you feelin', I'm on the ceilin'
Ridin like a villain makin' the killin's

Thrillin' the crowd with my new hairdo

Fifty dollar socks credit thousand dollar shoes
Man I give the blues to the Sucka MC's, who you be?
You know who I be, young nigga

When I step to the stage in my G-Boy stance
(What)

And say a few rhymes that make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove, I come from up above
You're trippin' on your girl 'cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat her, 'cause if you beat em', ya don't need 'em
Yeah, they gon' have your baby em',

Watch how fast they take your freedom
(What, uh-huh)
I believe em', and don't mistreat 'em, I stay up on 'em
(What)
But that's one to grow on nigga, let me flow on
('Cuz)
'Cause uh, you could rock to the rhythm you see
(What)

But you could rock to the rhythm on me, me, me
But when you do your thang make sure you do your thang
On the hang, and everythang is everythang
Man, I'm on this paper chase

Like them white boy D A's was on the case
But you know I ain't tryin' to floss but
Murder was the murder was the case that they lost
(Murda, murda, murda, murda)

Now do anybody in the house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg?
(Yeah)
There was no rappers hollerin' LBC, am I trippin' y'all?
(Hell, naw)

Now, when I grow up I wanna be
Like Snoop, mad pussy and women
As we do from the beginnin'
In and out of the Boz Hotel, they say
Your family don't know me

Hold on homie, thats phony, informal
Say, tell L's in jail, vest before test
No one in my click fell
(What)

The females with the almighty fatherly
'Cuz we thinkin' 'bout peeps, what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind
(Say what?)
'Cause you feelin' where we make it hizzot
But I'ma get back to the grizzats
Snoop D O double G comin' back for a remizzax

I'm the Doggfather
(Dogg dogg dogg, dogg dogg dogg, doggfather, father)
And ya know that, I'm the Doggfather
