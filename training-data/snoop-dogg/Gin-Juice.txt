He, ah, ha, ha
I'm serious nigga one of y'all niggaz got this ass motherfuckin' up
Aiy baby, aiy baby, aiy baby get some bubblegum in this motherfucker
Steady long, steady long nigga

With so much drama in the L B C
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D O double G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit like every single day

May I, kick a little something for the G's and, make a few ends
(Yeah, yeah)
As I breeze, through two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
'Cause my momma ain't home, I got bitches in the living room
Gettin' it on and, they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
(Six in the mornin')

So what you wanna do, sheeeit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But we don't love them hoes, yeah, so we gonna smoke a ounce to this
(But what)
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' ENDO
Sippin' on gin and juice laid back
(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind)

Rollin' down the street, smokin' ENDO
Sippin' on gin and juice laid back
(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind)

Now, that, I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups but they ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine

Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D O G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street

And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie
(Sadie?)
She used to be the home boy's lady
(Oh, that bitch)

Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N U T's, bitch you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Beitch, I'm just

Rollin' down the street, smokin' ENDO
Sippin' on gin and juice laid back
(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind)

Later on that day my homey Dr. Dre came through
With a gang of Tanqueray and a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down

Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top

'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the do'
And I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' ENDO
Sippin' on gin and juice laid back
(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind)

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
(Beotch)
Laid back
(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind)

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice
(Beotch)
Laid back
(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
