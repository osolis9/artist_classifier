Big Snoop Dogg

Can you be my doctor, can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down, so I can lick you up?
Make you give it up, give it up 'til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey, shittin' down the game

Be my head coach so you can put me in
And never take me off 'til you can taste the win
Do it again and again 'til you say my name
And by the way, I'm so glad that you came

Tell me, baby, are you wet?
I wanna gonna get you wet
Tell, tell me, baby, are you wet?
I just wanna get you wet
Wet, wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip for me, mami, can you drip, drip, drip?
(Would she, would she lay it down?)
Drip, drip, drip, drip for me, mami, can you drip, drip, drip?
(Would she, would she lay it down?)
It's the, it's the, it's The Cataracs

She's hot on a rainy day
Don't drown
Call me up
I can save you now

Lick your feet and kiss your mouth
Swisha sweet, I got you out
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me, take a trip down south

I can tell she's thirsty
I'm in the hole like a birdie
What you wanna do tonight, it's still early
Wanna get spewed tonight, she's all sturdy

I'm in between your lips
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit
But she wanna

Make it, make it, make it wet
I wanna get you wet
Tell tell me, baby, are you wet?
I just wanna get you wet
Wet, wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip for me, mami, can you drip, drip, drip?
(Would she, would she lay it down?)
Drip, drip, drip, drip for me, mami, can you drip, drip, drip?
(Would she, would she lay it down?)
It's the, it's the, it's The Cataracs

Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class?
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft
Would you like a paper plane, you know 'bout that paper, babe
But fuck them dollar bills, girl, make it rain

Holiday Inn, come and meet me on the 8th floor
Damn, it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
And, I apologize
But when I slip, slip inside, I turn girls into slip and slide

It's a flood in your heart, love
Girl, let me pop up in your hot tub, hey
Every night, every day, sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks different days, I do it different ways

Where you goin', what'd you say?
I want her river flowin' to another lake
'Nother ocean, 'nother ocean, on the beach, on the beach
I'm 'bout to take a swim, let, let me dip my feet

And get wet
I wanna get you wet
Tell, tell me, baby, are you wet?
I just wanna get you wet
Wet, wet

Drip, drip, drip, drip for me, mami, can you drip, drip, drip?
(Would she, would she lay it down?)
Drip, drip, drip, drip for me, mami, can you drip, drip, drip?
(Would she, would she lay it down?)
