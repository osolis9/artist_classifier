I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do
  (Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

They say it's escalate '64 on Vogue's
In the game pain, still the same
They knockin' at your door
You wanna only talk bad
It's a sad, sad thing, you dirty low down

I wonder
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

Wa la la la la la la, la la la la
(Won't you tell me now)
Wa la la la la la la, la la la la

Wa la la la la la la, la la la la
(Won't you tell me now)
Wa la la la la la la, la la la la
Snoop Dogg

Independent, I'm in it, been gettin' my cash right
Walkin' through the day time, holdin' my flashlight
Spliff-ted high as I can ever be
I'm lifted, driftin' on the memory

My style, my tone, my delivery
My maze is Frankie Beverly
Heavily influenced, I do it like you can't
I'm the weed to the Zag with the bag and a drink

Get live, that's five on the black hand side
Now try to stay fly with a piece of the pie
I heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
The baby gangsters, they get in the hood and on a mission

You pump 'em up, they fuck it up
Now what you need to do is toughen up
Now thug it up, what it do, dawg?
I thought you wanted to be like big

Snoop Dogg
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do
  (Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

When I get lost, I feel like a boss
She will be my salvation
When I feel low, with nowhere to go
She'll be my inspiration

She never spends time with her friends
Tells me she's mute without me
And when things go wrong, her faith is strong
I know that she'll never doubt me

Hey, Snoop Dogg
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do
  (Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

La la la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la la la la
