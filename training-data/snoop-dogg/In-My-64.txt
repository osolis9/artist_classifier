ft. Pharrell & Game

chorus

when you see me in my six 64
my niggers will be rolling on
you should see me in my six 64
when I make the bitch pop

I rather be on the block
With my 64 hop in
I ain’t for the video … hop in
I am the .. and patrol bottle pop in
So if get it popin roll it up and hop in

The game .. the opposite
So when I’m..drop in
So I can shine push the bottom drop in
When we are going to the candy shop we call it shopping for real
Got a girl locked in even the boll say we call it bolla blocking
