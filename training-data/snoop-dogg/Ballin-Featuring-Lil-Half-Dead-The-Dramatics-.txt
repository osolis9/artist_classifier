Like a star slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky
Tumbling through space
When you touch my hand

I swear I feel like I'm ballin'
  (Ballin', ballin')
Yeah I'm ballin'
  (Ballin', ballin')

Like a wheel, whirling round and round
Rolling down a hill
(Rollin' down a hill)
Spinning on the ground
(Rollin' down a hill)

Your kissing makes me dizzy, yeah
In the head and I'm ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')
I'm ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')

I love this game
'Coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac
Smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back
Banging the 8-track track
The dramatics and battle cat
And snoop like that

Big stars in big cars
We pull up at the big clubs
And sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are
Say it say it, 'coz they all deny it
Player play it, 'coz you can't deny it

As fly as it get
As fly as I spit you know its the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thang we do so original
I got to have it, lavish
Is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have

Like a rose
(Rose)
Flippin' down the street
(Flippin' down the street)
Lookin' oh so sweet
(Lookin' oh so sweet)
Bumpin' to the beat
(Bumpin' to the beat)

These streets they keep me busy, yeah
Makin' bread and I'm ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')
Yeah I'm ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')

Oh, here I go
Ballin making dough
Working for myself
'Coz it thrills me so

I keep women on my line
'Coz they know
That I'm ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')
Yeah I'm ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')

Oh here I go
Driving down the road
I can't help myself
Ballin' thrills me so

Yeah, you blew my mind
And I know, I'm ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')
Yeah ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')

Do that, who that, you that one they called on
Baller gets your ball on
It's all on now fall on to a new groove
Really ain't nothing to prove

We, set the mood
Or shoot some pool
Or blaze a cool
What? whatup fool

Now you can cruise if you choose
But I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my small kitchen ? Throw?
You know I gotcha, watch out
No need to pull your glock out
It's a players affair, now

Look at my hair and the girls wit me
They got the same thang on
Pimp pimp parade
My nigga gets your bang on
'Coz my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'
Keep it ballin'

He starts to mill
Just rollin' through his town
Stacking dollar bills
(Stacking dollar bills)
Raising dogg pound
  (He be raising the dog pound)

Because he's loved
Loved in every city
That's why he's ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')
Yeah he's ballin'
(Ballin', ballin', ballin')

There it is, 'coz it is there
Now have a seat
And come hit the game from a player
They say time brings change
And change brings time
It's so genuine and so divine

It's been so long, in fact it's overdue
Now tell me baby girl
What can d-o-double-g do for you?
I fell for you, I'll always look over you
There's really not much that a player would'nt do for you

So quit stallin' and fallin'
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'
Now quit stallin' and callin'
And come get yourself a bar of this ballin'

Yeah, thats right, this is radio station 187.4 DG
Sock it to your ass with something from the dramatics
And Snoop Dogg, let them spot that ok
It's another one of those world premiers
Doin' it to ya doggystyle, in ya air hole
For the 2000 plus 1, yeah
