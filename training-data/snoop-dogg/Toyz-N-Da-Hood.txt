Ah, check 1, bubba, yeah
We goin' back to the hip hop shower
Non stoppin', yeah
Well, the DJ's use the turn tables like gods
We're just havin' fun and nobody gets shot
Now, [Incomprehensible], where's my leading lady?

Now we're movin' forward
To hip hop and funk
Snoop and Bootsy is a musical lyric
Just like you're one strip

Holy, holy, man
Oh yeah, bubba

A heaven saw all our bitch
I don't know your name but, uh, I think I wanna kiss
Yeah, I know you're fine like the wine I drink
And you may not get a second chance
To make a first impression
So take the opportunity

Yeah, I pop these parties like I pop MC's
I never need a ride 'cause I carry my own keys
And if you wanna hang with us
Tell 'em it's all good, baby
All we do around here is, uh

Play with our toys, [Incomprehensible] wing down
And get that frown off your face
Yeah, all we doin' around here is
Party in the place

Swing down, let me hear you all say
Party in the place, party in the place
That's all we do around here, baby

Pull out those ties in his hands
Party in the place
You know it's our dance
Get that frown off your face
Party in the place, party in the place

I just sippin' on gin and juice
Tryin' to catch up with Mother Goose
Yeah, she got that golden egg
And now she trippin' all in my head

Uh, snoopadelic bubbas
