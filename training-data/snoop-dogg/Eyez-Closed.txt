And I can see it with my eyez closed, now
Feelin' like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

Sippin' Yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigger try to violate
Never goin' down, stay risin' like Andre
'Cause my corner back everythin' the Don say

Long Beach, yeah, I yell it out in every song
Every day, every night till I'm carried home
Forever known, big ballin', try it in the city
Then yellin' out 'swish' way before it in the net

And I ain't knockin' niggas hustle, it's all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in betweens
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame

And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags, soda pop, bitch, taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP

And I can see it with my eyez closed, now
Feelin' like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I do it 'cause I feel it, live it like I'm talkin'
Flow so straight but won't a nigger try and walk it
I'm so high, yeah, the weed, I'm still sparkin' it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparklin'

Got the competition shakin' like Parkinson's
Breads in the bag, call it good marketin'
Life's a bitch but I don't cartigan
That's what a word to the third letter

Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee's, I'm tougher than leather
Vietnamese eyez tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg, I'm bitin' whomever

'Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long left the Dogg has
'Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass

And I can see it with my eyez closed, now
Feelin' like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil, that's a crappy deal
'Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
'Cause they love you then they hate you
Then they love you again

Get away from me misery, get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks, I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring?

It's feelin' like hell rings, it's bringin' me back down
It's checkin' my background, it's ironic what's happenin'
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends

I'm spaced out, Dogg, I'd be on that moon talk
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma, wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visitin' around the time I was a sophomore

I guess everythin' I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pourin' out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyez closed

And I can see it with my eyez closed, now
Feelin' like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground

See it with my eyez closed
See it with my eyez closed
See it with my eyez closed
See it with my eyez closed
