Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'

Bitches lookin' at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin' my hair
Bitch quit talkin', quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet

Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the X you'll be relievin' your stress
