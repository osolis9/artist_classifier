King of California, California king
Face to face, wrist to wrist, toe to toe, eye to eye
This is it, kiss your lips but to no avail
It's like a seashell, I can hear you but I can't see you

You a wishing well, girl, I wish you well
Kiss and tell, I need your touch
I'm in the bed all alone, puffin' on a blunt
I guess I need to leave you but I know I won't
Frequently sleep with me, creep with me
Spend a week with me in paradise

California dreamin', skeemin', you got me gleaming
I need you on the teamie, you get my meaning
It sounds crazy but it's amazing
Lay down with meso, we can make some babies

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king

Eye to eye, cheek to cheek
Side by side you were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm, dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn

And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king

You and me, me and you, we can be, baby
All I want is you, you can be my lady
And I say that, let it go, lay back
Baby bue, you know we go way back

You and me, me and you, we can be, baby
All I want is you, you can be my lady
And I say that, let it go, lay back
Baby bue, you know we go way back

I make the bread, make love, make the bed
Girl, you got me taking my maze and shaking my head

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king
