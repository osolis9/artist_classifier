Mac Minister in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "Alpha" davit
In the game court with trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg tha dog father for 227 counts
Of flexin' his G's, poppin' his P's, dottin' his I's and crossin' his T's

The anti-player has filed and submitted an "Alpha" davit
In the game court with trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, tha dog father for 357 counts
Of verbal and reckless endangerment
From the million dollar mouthpiece and leavin' these super sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice

The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "Alpha" davit
In the game court, charging my client Snoop Dogg
Tha dog father for distributin' and manufacturin' game
Crossin' state and county lines
With the intent to pimp the system

Now if you wanna judge tha dog father
Bring him before 12 G's and open up his files
And you will see that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up, ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a hoe to a henchman about his pension

So all you jerks with them $11 words
Comin' out of your $2 mouth
About a multi-million dollar crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a Mack, I said

He's a five-star guerilla crip with bars and stars
While you suckers is lookin' for stripes
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle
And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the game court
To grant a motion, of 995 grounds of dismissal
