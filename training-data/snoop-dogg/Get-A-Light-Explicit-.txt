Say, man, lem-lemme get a light, homey
Yo, aye Timbo, this your Crippin' cousin Snoop Dogg cuzz
I told you we gotta get gorilla on this one right here, man
Take 'em to the zoo

To the L.A. Zoo, take these niggaz to the L.A. Zoo
Yeah nigga, 'bout to get ape shit crazy in here
One time, dig this

I need a light
Let me step up in this motherfucker 'til I get it right
I need a light
Let me lean, make it bright, everything is dynamite

Bust a bitch, tryna feel like a pimp would
It's Snoop D O Double G, I'm in your neighborhood
I make it crack-a-lack, do it just like that
Take a sip of this, nigga, have a puff of that

You had enough of that? Yeah, give it right back
Now lay your head back and roll in the Cadillac
How we do, what we do, what it is, where it's goin' down?

And the motherfuckers flip it
Rip it, get specific and dip it and then they drip it
'Cause you know we like to pop it 'cause you talkin' so different
Fix your focus and ride, I want the bangers to bang
Or get hyphy with my niggaz up north by the Bay

Tryna twist in my whip, I got the big body Benz
'Cause I'm rollin' with my nephew and we smokin' again
Turn your music down low, man, your shit too loud
What the fuck you talkin' 'bout? I put my gun in your mouth, nigga

Niggaz better get it right
Let me get a light, nigga, let me get a light
Yeah, better get it right
Nigga let me get a light, homey, let me get a light

To get it right I gotta get a light
Whoa, to get it right I gotta get a light
To get it right I gotta get a light
No, to get it right I gotta get a light

Hip hop, I ball like a split end
I'm all like I been in, I'm tryna put my bid in
Rip ride and try to keep it all hidden
Slide to the left and let your G homey get in

Gloccs of Velveeta, yep, I'm off the meter
Ride by and see you with my hands on a heater
Wanna be like the O but you act like a hoe
Gotta lot of Patron with a shot of the malt

Wannabes wanna beef like nine '99
You wanna battle me? You better learn how to rhyme
Boy, stop tweakin' 'fore I light up the place
What he say? Who you talkin' 'bout? I'm right in your face

Aye, aye, baby girl, you know we hit the coot a lot
Me and my nephews, yeah, we stayin' true to life
They get the party live, Dogg is the motivator
Rockin' the block socket and knockin' down the player haters

Yeah, nigga, you better know
It's incredible, unforgettable
Yeah, I bet I'm slow and I bet I'm low
We at the L.A. Zoo, I'm whylin' out like an ambulance

Niggaz better get it right
Let me get a light, nigga, let me get a light
Yeah, better get it right
Nigga let me get a light, homey, let me get a light

To get it right I gotta get a light
Whoa, to get it right I gotta get a light
To get it right I gotta get a light
No, to get it right I gotta get a light

Lemme get a light, nigga
Lemme get a light, man, real talk, man
It's your uncle, Snoop D O Double G
Bangin' down your do' with my nephew Timbo

You know how we be
I, indo, ooh wee, somethin' brand new, y'know what I mean?
Get it right, nigga, get it right, Dogg
Real spit cuzz

To get it right I gotta get a light
Whoa, to get it right I gotta get a light
