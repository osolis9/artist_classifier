Keep it shaking, Cali keep it quaking
'Cause the Ryders got me bringin' home the bacon
Show me love and it wasn't no mistakin'
That I would dedicate this melody, fuck the hatin'

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

Aiyyo, so what the deal dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg
Niggaz seem stressed to the brain, how you feel Dogg?
Nigga I'ma ride, set it up, let it spill Dogg
Anything you want, I can flip, got the skill Dogg
Baby girl you so sophisticated
Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearin' my name
Bad little brick house, go and do that thang

Yo, niggaz surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty, your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga askin', "Why he kissed me?"
Stop whinin', just to cry and get the mackin' daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin' crabby
That's why he bagged me, ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressin' over chicks, problem? Bet I solve it fastly

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

We gang bang on these niggaz like we 'posed to do
And I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted boo you, my one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs that's what I call love
All that pushin' and shovin', kissin' and huggin'
Thuggin', dig it, dug-in

I'm lovin' every minute of it boo
The way you stay true and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, no doubt
Ruff rydin', eastsidin', to the realest y'know
D O double gizze, you know how we get busy

Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin', I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my nigga strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

Yeah,  E V E, D O double gizze, y'know
Ruff rydin', eastsidin' foe life, ah yeah
And you thought it'd never happen
Fuck the haters, bow wow
Woof, woof, woof, woof

Beotch
