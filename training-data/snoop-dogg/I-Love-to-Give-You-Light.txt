Say, man, hey, ushers, deacons, lock the do'
I love to give you light

Geah, first of all, givin' honor to God
An' all the ministers on the pulpits, ushers
Deacons, an' my lovely choir, they sound so beautiful
Don't you agree? Sing it, sister

Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R an' G
Rhythm an' Gangsta, The Masterpiece, such a heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch

In the beginnin', as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin' the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin' the ball

As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin' the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin' in the city of jackers an' gangbangin' an' dope dealin'

Cold feelin' to be a product of niggaz around you
Once you get on top, they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin'
I found myself grindin' on the streets quite often

With a blue rag, bangin' the dub, fo' fifth coffin'
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a glock an' flossed the G ride
Niggaz throwin' up hands but it wasn't no peace signs

Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin' up
Disrespectin' my home, not carin' 'bout what mom was sayin'
An' then I found out that Mom wasn't playin'

Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga, be a man
Never be a victim of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light

I've grown, to comprehend the game
My name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg, just a block an' a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin' just what I practice to each an' all

I got a word from the beach to across the globe
Man, woman, young an' old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances, Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you

An' the people that is locked up, locked down
An' the people that's locked down
Also God should purchase the new Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin' thangs, ha ha

I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
'Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin to Heaven, huh? An' you ain't gon' go
So I need you right now to look at your neighbor
An' say, "Neighbor", say, "Neighbor, you ain't goin', you ain't goin'"
