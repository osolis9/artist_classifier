From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C.
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I served my cane

Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
But don't lose your grip, nine-trizzay's, the yizzear for me
To fuck up, shit, so, I ain't holdin' nuttin' back
And motherfucker I got five on the twenty sack

It's like that and as a matter of fact
(Rat-tat-tat-tat)
'Cuz I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Yiggy, yes, y'all in, Snoop Doggy Dogg in
The motherfucking house like everyday
Droppin' shit with my nigga Mr. Dr. Dre

Like I said, niggaz can't fuck with this
And niggaz can't fuck with that
Shit that I drop 'cuz ya know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a motherfucking cop

Tic-toc never the glock, just some nuts and a cock
Robbin motherfuckers then I kill dem blood claats
Then I step through the fog and I creep through the smog
'Cuz I'm Snoop Doggy, Doggy, Doggy

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay, bow wow wow yippy yo

And wave the motherfuckers like ya just don't care
Yeah, roll up the dank, and pour the drank
And watch your step 'cuz Doggy's on the gank
(Why?)

My bank roll's on swoll
My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With the Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in yo bitch is where ya might find me

Layin' that, playin' that G Thang
She want the nigga with the biggest nuts, and guess what?
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
What's my motherfucking name?
