My goodness, my gracious
Shell toe Adidas with the fat blue laces
Hand full of aces, trumped up, dump trunk, white wall paces
Drink till you drop, motherfucker cop

Old English, 800 on the block
Way before St. Ides came to the spot
Niggers used to hang out and do the pop lock
And if we got into some shit, we never pop shots

We'd squab scrap, whatever it was
And live to talk about it and we get old cause
And keep a pack of Zig-Zags for that good old bud
We do a house party, what the fuck is a club?

And the ese's, they sold most of the drugs
La familia, hell yeah and we, the thug
We get money, yeah and we do low ride
Represent it and talk nope, nope, not I

That's the code in every hood that you roam
Fastest way to catch a hot slug in your dome
O.G., the place that I call home
Black Lac like that and it's sittin' on chrome

Plaque in back, strap in Lac
Antennas wake you up for a rat tryin' to set a new trap
Swingin' the track, drippin' curl juice on your back
Breakin' hearts like Roger and Zapp, motherfucker

Back in the day, it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smokin' the reefer
And pound for pound, we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down
Some say we the next generation but we lack education

Crazy Horse, drinkin' mad dog 20/20
Silver satin blue Kool Aid saggin' in my Dickies
I got my locs on, sailin' through my neighborhood
Catch you slippin' on them bricks, it ain't all good

Front door kicker, Glock spitter
Black and gold flag across my face when I get you
3 wheeler tippin', turnin' up the Alpine
[Incomprehensible] while I listen to the grapevine

Goldie blue crips all by the front door
East side rip ridin', gang bangin' all I know
Heart break hotel, hush, puppy neck kicker
I grew up on that crazy one five, nigger

If you look from my block then hop somethin'
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no peel nigger block huntin'
Blue corduroys while I'm talkin' on my brick phone
14 years old had to bring the shit home

My uncle Sugar Bear showed me how to bag it up
Look at the block now, nigger, it's sewed up
I ain't playin' with you old grand pubas
Peace out, Rolando ran things with no cuz

Now take a picture of this 8 ball sipper
Look down at my shoes, blue strings, nigger
Goldie Loc will keep this motherfucker crack-a-lackin'
The only thing I wanna hear is gang bang rappin'

Some say we the next generation but we lack education
Hangin' with the crew of devastation
Yeah, but we one nation mama
Tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show

The way we funk around here ain't nothin' consensual
You know I funk so hard, you gonna need your parent's credentials
Now I'm in the street 'cause I lost my sheep
But now I know where to find that

Now how cool is cold when you're tryin' to compete?
Standin' next to me, son, you better take a seat
Can't none of you cutthroats funk like me
You better check with Snoop Dogg and get your pedigree

Why oh, why do I think like that?
If I am with the dog, you must be a cat
Now tally-ho and away we go
See you next week with a brand new show

I want the bomb, I want that O.G. back
There's a party goin' on in my head
While I think about the blood that we shed
Then party, uh, when the player play
There's a party goin' on up in here

Back in the day it was cheaper to keep her
Hang out with your friends and smokin' the reefer
And pound for pound, we were the baddest in town
You just had to get up for the get down

Some say we the next generation but we lack education
Hangin' with the crew of devastation
Yeah, but we one nation mama
Hangin' with the Snoopatronics bobba
