Get your motherfuckin' glass
'Cus it's a blast from the past
You didn't think would touch it two times nigga
Gin and Juice up in this bitch, yeah

Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor
You feel me, get your ice, get your cups
'Cus we about to get fucked up in here
Yeah, straight up

I'm still smokin', driftin', swifta than a mothafucka
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank

Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws
Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' nigga

To fucked up off that G-I and juice
C-I get loose, nigga what you wanna do
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low-low

Invertible top, spot for the glock, I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg
So toss out the soda spot
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

Rollin' down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin' down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Now trip dis', I'm on Interstate 10, fuckin' with this Creole
She said she knows Nino, now stop me loc
Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here

There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time
See I picked you up, now I'm gonna stick you up
And dick you up, give you what you need
Then bring you back down to reality with that California weed

She seemed trouble at first and then it got worse,
'Cus now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way

Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain
Now it ain't no thing, 'cus she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff, I said
"Look here bitch you've had enough"

Rollin' down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin' down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up
Say what, say what, come on, now
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up
What you say, what you say, yeah

I'm hopped by the ice cream shop
The cops saw me, stopped me, heard me
Were's Serv-D, well serve me, since you got that big bad ass dangle
Nigga you know I'm know for havin' that big ass bank

Tryin' to find all your dope, 'cus your a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
'Cus times gettin' hard on the boulevard
But I refuse to loose my Zippo

Lil' Jimmy's sent me something
I need to cop something, got some, I know you got some
Nigga stop frontin', get at your boy
Hook it up like Master P
Would it be a tragedy to fill me the best weed

Rollin' down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin' down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Bitch
