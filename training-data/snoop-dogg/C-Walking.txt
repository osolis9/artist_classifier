ike a shot through my heart, such a fool boy.
How you spin me down
Show me all of the stars in your world boy
Circling around

But I can't let go
Cause I want you so
And baby I'ma hold you tight
If you just say so
I'll be falling in your arms tonight

I am flying higher
I am flying higher

Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying

Fallen lights from the sky like a showdown
Lighting up the night
I'll be your satellite, take my hand now
Till the end of time

But I can't let go
Cause I want you so
And baby I'ma hold you tight
If you just say so
I'll be falling in your arms tonight

I am flying higher
I am flying higher

Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying

Woah oh oh oh...

Mind to mind, eye to eye
Talk it, walk it, in the sky
Yeah yeah, what a player
Cloud nine, in the air
Elevate that, celebrate that (Celebrate)
This feels good to me (feels so good)
Love is peace, sleeve to sleeve
Heart to heart, you and me (Heart to heart, you and me)
What's it gonna be?
What you wanna do?
I just got to find some time and space to be with you
Taste the aroma, all up on ya
She was the world, free as the bird
Slippin' down, slippin' town
Blastin' off in the clouds

Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying
Feels like I'm walking on air
Feels like I'm flying

(Walkin' on air)

Woah oh oh oh...
