In this times of hate and pain
We need a remedy to help us through the rain
Can't you see, I'm straight up G, Old Chief
Fuck you niggas, think you can fuck with me
(Oh c'mon)

Now, that pimp is gonna jump back
Bitch and fuck that shit
I'm qualify to knock a hoe no matter where ever I've go
Excuse me partner, this is pimpin', little pimpin' let you know

Break the bitch you sayin', "I will"
Separate the bitch but you sayin', "I will"
Damn nigga, shit since you but it like that
I'ma about lay some right now nigga and take them straight to the track

I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'ma stay O.G.
Fresh out the pen only 30 today
And every bitch [Incomprehensible] in a multiplied ways

Now since world, why did the little girl walk around
With a gold fish in her pocket? So she could smell like the big girl
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money if you have to knock her motherfucking ass out

I don't care whatcha do
Long's you don't fuck with mine
(C'mon sing y'all)
You think you can't be touch
Niggas disappear all the time

Oh, blue eyes, Dogg Sinatra
Make a nigga disappear like Jimmy Hoffa
(Where is he?)
The glock cocker, hoe hopper, show stopper
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth

I put you and a freak in a building
And separate you from your children
(Daddy)
I stay G'd up
All the G's from my set ain't never PC up

If you hit the main line, you gonna get stuck
Paying motherfuckers off 'cuz sucka duck
Me and my niggas go heart and pain
Putting pain where ain't making bitch niggas pay

It's a clear blue sky there on the Eastside
Throw your set up and wave it from side to C-Side
I'm talking big shit, hold my dick
Banging on you 'cuz, nigga this crip

I got so many tricks up my sleeve
(Ah you ain't knowin')
For you hoes to disbelieve
(Hoes to the basement)
You wanna fight let's bring it on
We's about a thousand niggas strong

I don't care whatcha you do
(I don't care what the fuck whatcha do)
Long you don't fuck with mine
(As long you don't fuck with mine)
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time

No, I don't love you, bitch, you a hoe, I never will
Can't tell you my feelings, scratch the fence and don't feel
Bitch, matter fact be gone
Fuck around and how you Mama saying, "Baby, he wrong"

Talking about he a real pimp
Bitch, It's jumbo lance with proper, proper jumbo shrimp
Since I'm prepare with my hoe, got it cracking with my hoe
Steady macking with my hoe, now, I'm stacking with my hoe

I pop a bottle of Mo, about to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving 'em and breaking you know
Did the weed, man get in, he taking it too long
But when he get it dogg, I'm taking us off
(Give it up nigga)

Niggas know how D-O-double G does it
Known for making that crip hop music
Don't abuse, just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass
Upper class, cold motherfucker

I don't care whatcha you do
Long's you don't fuck with mine
You think you can't be touch
Niggas disappear all the time

I got so many tricks up my sleeve
For you hoes to disbelieve
You wanna fight, let's bring it on
We's about a thousand niggas strong
