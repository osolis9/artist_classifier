Watch your mouth, never speak on what you not know
I'm from the west coast, I turn his face into a pothole
15 deep niggas creepin' in the Tahoe
Let's see you act macho when I pull the burner on ya

Sideways like a taco
Rap niggas we all talk like a Raldo
Trunk full of cargo, dry like Bar stow
Arsenal run up on 'em, get up on 'em

Drill 'em with the clips, niggas gon' respect mine
I run this whole shit, crip rag in my pocket
Three eighty on my hip but back to this hip hop
Who next on the list
Gangstas don't kiss, we get old and die rich

I smoke till I'm sleep, crush these niggas with my fist
Your daddy was a coward you's a son of a bitch
So back to the glock with the infra-blue clip
We hit licks and gang bang, you on some T-pain shit

Chop the pop and 20 crip, watch the flames hit his whip
Then I'm back to the block shit, rock shit, hot shit
Hit 'em in the chest, doggy run up in his pockets
Misrepresenting sock him in his eye socket

I sat back and let you little niggas make your profits
Nonsense, I'm watching, hoes out of pocket
You heard what they say, don't block it till you knock it
You stole my whole style

I'm 'bout to take you fools hostage, brah, bhrah
From the looks to the hooks
I'm looking at these new niggas flippin' through my book
There's only one king, is you a pawn or a rook?

I got hand machine guns and soldiers on foot
So beef with me it's none, nigga done south, huh
I throw a bullet at ya who gon' catch it nigga duck
Then send them goons at ya

Turn your weapons into dust
You against me, it's like trying to fight a bus
I'm at the BET Awards, sitting in disgust, it's still a
G Thang)
But yet they wanna be us, they wanna be Daz

They wanna be Kurupt
Cash on delivery money up front, yeah
Bubble kush out a purple blunt
Who's the best nigga circle one
Snoop Dogg, I'm large in the streets

My arms and my feets knee deep in the game
I'm the best on the beat, let you little niggas speak
And run for a treat, motherfuckin' geeks
All y'all niggas owe me until you rest in peace
And that's our D.P.G. motherfucka

That's real shit man, how the fuck y'all gon' keep
Having these award shows out here on the west coast
But ain't no mutherfuckas from the west coast
Winning no awards, nigga? It's like that, it's just like that

We showed you niggas how to do this shit
Bitch ass nigga, want some, get some
Bad enough, take some
