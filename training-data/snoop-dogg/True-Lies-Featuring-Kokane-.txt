Yo, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Stop the cameras, stop the press, stop the press
Now, Bill, this yo,' nigga, Snoop Dogg
Now, answer me this, did you fuck that bitch or what?

That's actually, not the first time that question's been asked
But, since, I believe and I think any person
Reasonable person would believe, that, that is not covered
In the definition of sexual relations I was given

I'm not going to answer it except to refer to my statement
I had intimate, contact with her that was inappropriate
I do not believe any of the contacts I had with her
Violated the definition I was given, therefore I believe
I did not do anything but testify truthfully on these matters

What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie?

Lies, lies, stories and alibis
Big Mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high

You tryin' to cover up the holes in your sneakers
You need to put your motherfuckin' face to the speakers
Quit tryin' to run from it, holla holla at me
And c'mere, you big dummy, dumb ass nigga

Don't you know you can't run from the Dizzogg
I'm down with Gizza, the long arm of the lizzaw
Y'all, niggaz know what's happening you turn your back again
And I'm bound to get it crack-a-lin', I'm back again

And everybody happy for me, ain't that the truth?
That's a motherfuckin' lie, fuck that fool
Black folks stick together 'til we die
That'll be the day

What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie?

Liar, liar, pants on fire
Smoke so much dope they call me Snoopy Prior
Well, goddamn, which way is up I'm tryin' to get higher
I won't stop puffin' 'til I retire

My bitches, my niggaz, they off the wire
They lovely, they love me, call me Sire
Movie star bitches the ones you desire
Angela Bassett, Tyra, Mariah, the flyest, the flyer

See most bitches like fuckin' with a rider
Slider, to the sider, invite her
To a gangsta, party, provider
With a lot of meat by-products

And beat the puddy-pot and got up
She licked the dick from the top to the bottom
That's a bad bitch
Then she grabbed me by my nuts and said, "Hmm, I got 'em!"

What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie?

Lies, lies, stories and alibis
Big Mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high

Oh, you do know what's the use if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
Ah, what's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
