Can you take me to a place I never been before
Let me wipe my Chuck Taylors on the [?] floor
Can you take me to a place where the ocean is blue
Toasting, coasting, real smooth, to the motion of Snoop
Can you take me to a place where they love like [?]
Can you take me to a place where they love to smoke
Can you take me to a place where it's easy to see
It's easy to G, the land of the dog's
Can you take me, take me, take me, take me, take me
Can you take me, take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me to a place I've never been before
Let me ride in a Benz I never drove before
Slide in a stolen car never stole before
Get a taste of some weed I never rolled before
Take me out the ghetto could I see another life
Eat some dinner with no bummer, that would be nice
Plus in crips with no drama, that would be tight
Trips to the Bahamas, that would be the life

My mind gone, smoke 4-5 blunts in a row
Let's take a trip, how far is you trying to go
I need to know, have you ever bee off the coast
In the ghost spot trapping, cutting up stones
Been on the block where the money is the trough
And for this paper, I break a motherfucker skull
Take me to a place where no one gets old
High on drugs and forever we will grow

Let's take a trip, around the world, on a jet
And live large I did it all with the pirates
Take me to a place where I ain't grind yet
Take me to a place where Jesus died at
Can you take my mind away, on the life wrath
I don't wanna go nowhere where people die fast
And this for my nigga who, die for the cash
Take me to the place where cars don't crash
So I can do a hundred and forty, miles on the dash
Smiled and I laugh, on a power full of [?]
Take me to a place where I don't gotta to stash
My weapon in my right cause I don't got my [?]
Can you take me to a place where all the [?]

Take me to a place where they love you cause you're black
Take me to a place where they make the money at

Take me down the path Doctor [?]
Take me to a place [?] far from [?]
Take me pass the go line, a place where we don't get weak
Keep a strong mind,
Yeah want to it though, tickets to the super bowl
Chuck Taylors cross the benz floor
Money falling off trees, let the wind blow
Like the wind in that Chicago
I'm in that S5, 54
Take me straight to fly code, you fin [?] out of 10, you clocked dough
Take me to the bentleys, a place where everybody g's
Put me on the big screen, been on my grind since 16
