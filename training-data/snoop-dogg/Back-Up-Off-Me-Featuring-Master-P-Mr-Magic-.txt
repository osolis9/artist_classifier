Now it's time for me to be good to you
I'm 'bout to give you your own blocks wodie

You do what you wanna do

We ship 'em, give it to the world, sell it to the fuckin' record stores
Tell the fuckin' haters to shut up, 'cause it still ain't 'No Limit'

I know they thought this was 'Tha Last Meal' but they don't realize
It ain't the last deal, Snoopy it's me and you baby, let's toast to success
