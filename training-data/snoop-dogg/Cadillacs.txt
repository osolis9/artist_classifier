I been missing that feeling and the vibe
Can you help restore that please?
Cadillacs
Crocker sacks
5-0-1 policies and golf hats
I go see, my homies is deep
Hanging out, hanging out
On too much drinks
Rules of the game
If you choose to break
You can't be a snitch,
Don't be a bitch, nigga,
Make your name!

I 'member when I was young
I had a whole lot of fun
My momma bought me everythang
Even a toy gun
Tell 'em what is this
I come up with the piece on
Playn quarterback is as much as I stake on
And I'm fool, all punk like a D song
And with the love, mammas, yeah, I'm bucking, the heat's on
You know time will tell
Half of my homies is dead or in jail
Stick to the script like OG golf carts
Get your scrap on
Stall me out, you got no heart

Fuck where, shit yeah, nigga, I'm in it
Authentic, (???) I'm representing
To the tibby, keep it so cribby
Smoke a hoe's bippy, flip bread to the skippy
Bow wow, yipy, low stokin' like dippy
Real G's fuck with me, rare breed, different cut
West Coast, motherfuckers, get up!
