[Hook]
Girl, you've got me fadin' away...
And I can't go another day
You make it hard to stay away
Girl, you've got me fadin' away...
Girl, you've got me fadin' away...
They know other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl, you've got me fadin' away...
Fadin' away

[Verse 1]
In my mind it's all about you
I don't know what to do 'cause you have got me confused
With talkin' on the phone, we fuss and fight, you 'bout that life
I just want to love you right, love you right...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Make time, make love - that’s what we made
Look at nowadays, lookin' like it’s gon' fade
Tea leaves, we'll see, he a G, so
If he lose, baby, he gon' gain another, though
What a brother know? Keep it on the low
That’s what my grandma said, it's supposed to go
Feels the same, we toast and post
And if it all work out, then we Casper the ghost
Me and DâM-FunK, we capture the funk
...unleash it and set it off, foe
Playin' with me, boo, you'd best let it all go
The Beach... and the wind you blow

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
It’s hard to stay with you, girl
It’s so hard to stay with you, girl
And even harder to play with you girl
It’s so hard to stay with you, girl
And even harder to play with you girl
Fadin' away...
Fadin' away...
Fadin' away...
Fadin' away...
Fadin' away...
Fadin' away...
Fadin' away...
