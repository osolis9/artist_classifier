Oh, good evening mister Sheen, are you winning
No he's smoking right now
Winning, winning, winning, winning, yeah
Oh, if you a motherfucker winner, if you a motherfucker winner
Put your motherfucker hands... right now, it's for all the winners
If you's a looser, get your bitch ass out here, strictly for the winners, yeah
Cause we gonn' win motherfucker, we gonn' win, yeah, yeah
Who, me? You know who I am
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/snoop_dogg/winning.html ]
I am intergalactic,... raw, uncut, but so pornographic
Measures so drastic, oh but a classic
Hit us on twitter, look at all the traffic
Never loose on the move fresh and clean
You are in the mind of the machine
Bling blang think back what it used to be
Shooting torpedoes,... walk like we do
... get left or get right cause it's show time tonight
And I'm winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning
Yeah, like I say it, this is strictly for the winners
You motherfucking looser, what you doing in here, you don't even know how to win
You see winning is all we know, winning is all we do, we win, win, win, 
That's all it is to it, nothing to it what you do it you did
Shit, that's some good shit right there

In it to win it, winning since the beginning
Shine and Sheen and win it, make seduce with the... 
I get it back and we're rapping and now they're clapping and tapping
They zipping and zapping and let... what's happening
Big stage big game, with the big names
See winning ain't everything, see winning is the only thing
I got a... to blame, you better know the game
With the shadow tiger blood now I need a lot of... 
Winning's on my mind, that's the only thing I'm thinking off
Winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning
How many times I gotta show you this shit man
You know I've been winning for a long time
That's all the fuck I do is win man
If you's a winner, put some smoke in the air, yeah, yeah
Blaze it up, come on, blaze it up come on, blaze it up, come on, come on, come on
Yaba daba-du mama, glory be the one, the one and only, I'm a winner
Winning
