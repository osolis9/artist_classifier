When we touchdown
In the Midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass
Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, Louisiana
Mississippi, Tenekees, e'ry muhf**kin state
When we touchdown
Go right from the plane to the range
When we touchdown
On the private plane gettin brain, 'till we
Touchdown, there aint no way to keep 'em quiet
Wit' T.I. and Shady baby we 'bout to excite a riot
When we touchdown

When we get in town, you know how we getting down
Pull up clean an hop on out, snatch all the freaks then walk on out
I'm livin what they talkin bout, shinin' if it dark or not
That One Hundred DX Double R, you'll find that in the parkin' lot
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for Zone 3
4, 5, and 6 as well as 1, Atlanta im forever son
Still be on watever coast, grindin' blowin heavy smoke
Em you betta tell em folk, wont hesitate 2 let him go
They know i put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin' me I'll put that beam right on your tater
(bow wow wow wow)
You dont wanna see T.I.P. he irate
Try to keep him in a cage but somehow he keep escapin'
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Islands I be takin'
Private planes out to Spain, my G4 flyin' I ain't fakin'
The money ain't a thing, think I'm lyin' your mistaken
You can find long lines, and all kinds of bitches waitin'

Welcome to the Midwest, yes
Where the Detroit players, ball like you have no idea
The boy is here
Got the whole place lookin' like it's candy painted, ain't it
Like we left the kids at home and just let 'em loose with the crayons
F**k, I just hit a jogger
People lookin like frogger
They hoppin out the way whenever they see Marshalls car comin
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin like they're crumpin', the way they're tumblin'
I gotta do something
But soon as I hit the carwash, to get the tar off
Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend
This is for the pimps, listenin' to MIMS, nail polish on the rims
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal when I touchdown

From my arrival, to my departure
I guarantee I put this D-I-C-K in somebody's daughter, ey
I still have my way with the ladies across the water
Flew to Paris from Haiti, just some shit that I thought of
It's ironic kind of shit that we buy man make us psychotic
Threat to corporate America, that why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant look at what Hip-Hop den done
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out the ghettos, relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey I'm sorry really I promise
But niggas, bitches, and hoes do exsist I'm just bein' honest
But why am I bein' punished? Why is you so astonished?
Now I ain't got a degree just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me I know millions o' folks that love me
Well you can tell how they yellin' and screamin' an waitin' for me
When I touchdown
