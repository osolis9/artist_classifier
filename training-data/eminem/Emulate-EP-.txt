[** Remix, Extended Version; feat. Obie Trice:]


[*10 seconds instrumental]*

[Intro: ~Eminem~]
Yeah!

[Obie Trice:]
Obie the person that came up and deverted
Cause of nervousness. - That was solely the homie's verdict.
It was worth it cause he changed, became so I observed it,
Certain such of a purpose.
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain.
That's why there's curtains in his murder if you gettin' worked up,
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher.
I had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doin' the same in school.
Now look what he became! A fool,
Cause he learned how to sustain his two and obtain fame from you?
Living hard, but still Julliard
A god walks in but ain't spent a day in a pew.
Regardless of this, I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents,
So welcome to the art department.

[Eminem:]
I stimulate the brain, mimick, emulate a saint
Cynic keep 'em thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't.
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, suck "Your-anus"! (Uranus!)
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say
He may seem as though he's plain normal if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say.
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say,
So he's vague. - So they mistake him for just bein' crazed.
You part ways, your impression of him changed; you don't think he's strange?
You turn around and tell him: "Peace and thanks."
Then you catch him flippin' you off with his pants down, hands around his Scrotum,
Tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs. (AAAHHH!)

[Eminem:]
It's all psychologic. - Why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick? (bllabllablaaabbbb!)
Or am I truly psychotic, or are my molecules just diabolical?
Cause biologically - I defy logic.
By golly, haul me off on a trolly
Pro'ly want a crack, I'm back on that wacky tobacco.
I'm a step away from Crack, Obie smacked the shit outta me!
I'm so slap happy, man. Snap me back to reality!
I'm a walkin' art gallery. - A science museum.
Elephantiasis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see 'em!
I pull em out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance; I can't just put 'em back in my pants. (HELP ME!)
