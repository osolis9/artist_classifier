Em, it's Paul, listen
Joel just called me and he told me
You're in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range

I told you not to fucking bring your gun around like an idiot
Outside of your home, you're gonna get yourself in trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home, you can't carry it on you
Leave your fucking gun at home
