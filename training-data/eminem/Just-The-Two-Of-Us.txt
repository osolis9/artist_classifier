Baby, your da-da loves you
(Hey)
And I'ma always be here for you, no matter what happens
(Hey)
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna
Keep you from me, I love you

C'mon, hai-hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys
And let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell, da-da musta runned over a skunk
(Whew!)

Now, I know what you're thinkin' it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it
(No!)

And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle?
(Yeah!)
And Mama said, she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat

It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt, her was eatin'
Dinner while you were sweepin' and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, isn't she? We'll, let her wash off in the water
And me and you can sway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I

See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson

And you don't want a brother do ya?
(Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad

But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryin' to climb out
(Wahh!)
I told you, it's okay, hai-hai, wanna ba-ba
Take a night-night, nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga

Her make goo-goo ca-ca, da-da, change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon, as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I

Wake up, sweepy, head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a whittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry ,honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear
(Mama!)

That's why you can't get her to wake but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock?
(Yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready, now, here we go, on the count of free

One , two, free, whee!
(Whoosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the wa-ta
No more fightin' wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother

Blow her kisses, bye-bye, tell Mama you love her
(Mommy!)
Now, we'll go, play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
And when we ride

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just you and I

Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us

Just me and you, baby
Is all we need in this world, just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you

Remember that, if you ever need me
I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask

Your da-da loves you, I love you, baby
