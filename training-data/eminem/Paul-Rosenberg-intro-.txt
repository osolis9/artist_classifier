Em, it's paul...
listen, joel just called me and he said you're in the fuckin back behind his studio, shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range.
i told you not to fuckin' bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home.
you're gonna get yourself on trouble.
don't bring your gun outside of your house you can't carry it on you.
leave your fuckin gun at home.
