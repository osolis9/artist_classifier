Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', dirty dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer

You wacker than the motherf***er you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then

My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic, hi, Marshall
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your a**

Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast, it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the f*** out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherf***in' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So, when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin', â€½F*** the worldâ€ like Tupac
I just don't give a f***
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck

So, put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is whack
I just don't give a f***
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a f***

I'm nicer than Pete but I'm on a search to crush a Milk bone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'

Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols

But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' s*** out of proportion

The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a f***in' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So, when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin', â€½F*** the worldâ€ like Tupac
I just don't give a f***
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***

So, put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is whack
I just don't give a f***
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finally get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a f****

Somebody let me out this limousine
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like 'Rage Against the Machine'
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion

F*** droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherf***in' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of b***hes
Sick of naggin', bosses b***hin' while I'm washin' dishes

In school I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team

Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me
Snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

So, when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin', â€½F*** the worldâ€ like Tupac
I just don't give a f***
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***

So, put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is whack
I just don't give a f***
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a f***
