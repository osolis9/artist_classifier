I hit harder than foreman
Landing both, both gloves to a low blow with no cup
Leave you speech less like when arrested development broke up
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge

Crack skulls through helmets
With the penetration of a screw nailed in
Return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge

Before battles, we pour blood
And toast, death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress' doorsteps
Slaughter lamb and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage

Bronchitis, lung failure language unfamiliar
Art through a flooded air brush [unverified] leave craft
Sentences joined with words holding hands
It's a tight squeeze from where your head will be landing
In exact time flight leaves

Who's arm is this? I must have cut it off of the pharmacist
And refused to renew my seventh prescription of darvocets
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
And never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed

I hate my life that's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich and just ate the knife
My mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to Christ'
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice

Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin' to shake the lice

Bugs fallin' out of my head I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm crawlin' out of my bed found it red
And my rash is returning I feel the sensation of burning
Occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine

Screamin' at my shadow, "Please quit followin' me"
These pills keep screamin', "Please quit swollin' me"
The devil keeps screamin', "Please get down on one knee"
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me
