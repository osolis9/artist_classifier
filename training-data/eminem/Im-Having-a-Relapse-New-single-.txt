Torture chambers, secret passage ways,
vats of acid... and deadly vaults.

Damn, it feels good to be back, like having a relapse.

How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
he's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic,
they compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
tryna to stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequins ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed,
Man, it's kick ass, the first thing I put on is the mask

Speaking of masked men, it ain't to late to have a change of pace
and take it off and show my face so you can see the things you facin'
Slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation,
thats bacon souffle you making aint you, well thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma,
just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for it mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
shovin' the vacuum nozzle down the bathroom faucet

It seems like every day I get a little flakier,
the medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that 18 month old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in 80 some places, baby, here shady comes lady
he's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chain-ch-saw baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dumb dumbs
yeah, here I come come, you hear the rumbling, vrum vrum

There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum drum
a head and torso of someone, where'd it come from? Who's it belong to?
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms
Clearly theres some(thing) wrong 'cause she didn't come home
shes missing -- where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
now everybody get your dance on to my damn song
c'mon
