Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(Dreamin', of fallin, Dreamin', of fallin)

[B.o.B - Verse 1]
Let's pretend like its '98, like Im eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A (A-Town)
Hoping for a record deal, to renew my fame
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (Ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sing
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Lets try to use imagination

[Chorus - Hailey Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

[B.o.B - Verse 2]
Ok, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all-good
Like I didnt live staring in a notebook
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should
But I ain't have neighbors thats why they call it hood
Now lets pretend like I aint got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
Im talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre

Before I ever got on Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So lets just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus - Hailey Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream, but those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream, but those days are gone)

[Eminem - Verse 3]
Let's Pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that was so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can rip stadiums he's just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You wont amount to shit, quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium checked you thinking like an alien
It just aint realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even name when hes pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and this WIC shit
Cause he never risked shit he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he aint even here it he pretends that

Airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
