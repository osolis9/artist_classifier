I remember the first time I came here, it's been a rough six years
And I'm just happy to not be that person anymore, and so is my wife
Thank you for letting me do this
That's all I have to share right now

Is there anyone else who would like to share with us tonight?
Uhh yeah
My name is Marshall
(Hi Marshall)
Yeah, it's my life, in my own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their Armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em

But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
Daddy look what I made, Dad's gotta go catch a plane

Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka by baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing she keeps screamin'
She don't want me to sing
â€½You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy crying?â€

Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more
â€½Daddy you're lying
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're mineâ€

She's piling boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
â€½Daddy please daddy, don't leave daddy no, stop itâ€
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket, it's got a picture
â€½This'll keep you safe daddy, take it witchaâ€

I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talkin' 'cuz man I can hear 'em
They're sayin' you got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show â€~em that you love â€~em for it's too late

And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone
And the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow, â€½And thank you all for comin' outâ€
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
â€½Daddy it's me, help mommy her wrists are bleedin'â€,
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin
It says, "Number 1 dad", that's all I wanted
I just want to give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'

But baby wait
It's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show â€~em that you love â€~em more than us
That's what they want, they want you Marshal, they keep
screamin your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep

Just take another, pill, yeah I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah word, keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me

I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream â€~Gosh Shady' and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes

That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin'
There's birds singin', it's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain, just smile back
