Shady
We're back

Nothing can stop and nothing can change
And you better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole

All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no [Incomprehensible] brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or damn get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best

I'm nowhere thought up as that, not even the same league
As Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
The name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z

Yo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radio
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily

And they very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which is amaze me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big b-b-big b-b-baby

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin' to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes gets better each day

Replay my relay race
When I was chasin' the Afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Shady
Stat Quo, we're back

This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs c'mon
I treat the mic like the block, **** with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve

I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves sure was a breeze
I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "Suck my ****" I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese

I find it hard to believe who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' **** **** I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E

Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it? Drink my ****
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail he

Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'ma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the **** they gon' tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady

Shady
Bobby Creek, we're back

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my **** I want 'em back
Like mic check, **** for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some **** that ain't right yet

No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all **** won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with 'em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a **** to the apparel of you and some of them

Stand a chance, at the dance, without a bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you **** to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me

To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a **** about ya **** I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track
****

Shady
Cashis

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand **** sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too

To the block, I'm the truth to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And **** still out there, you just gotta ****
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth

The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life,  **** run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach

You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof of the building, **** at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't **** me
I'm a walking obituary, death lived in me

I take life through the pen, by the way I'ma see
Or have you **** in the pen like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from ****
With S.K's, **** and Mini fourteens

I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a ****
On Pro-sac, D's and ****, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of ****
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back, ****

Shady
Ha! I told you we was back
We're back
