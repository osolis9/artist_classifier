Better In Time (Remix) Lyrics Eminem

I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

(Tupac)
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggaz tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
a lil', trick on a mission tryin to get (((him a peace)))
Me and my niggaz is thug niggaz, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggaz
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby

(Leona Lewis)
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
Oooh yeah(It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too oooooh(It'll all get better in time)

(Bridge)

Since there's no more you and me (No more you and me)
This time I let you go so I can be free
And Live my life how it should be(No No No No No No)
No matter how hard it is
I will be fine without you
Yes I Will

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
Oooh(It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really loved you
I'm gonna smile cos I deserve too yes I do(It'll all get better in time)

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too yeaaaah Ooooh oooooh (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really loved you
Going to smile cos I deserve too Ooooooh (It'll all get better...)
