'Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game

Woah, oh, shouldn't be difficult to explain just why
You came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game cold as ice, you remain
Fuck em' all, tell em' all eat shit, here we go again

You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack
I'm nuts, Michael vick in this bitch
Dog fall back your mutts, fuck your worms
You've never seen such a sick puppy

Fuck, it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble them up tric, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, yummy
You get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey

Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance while I diss you to the beat
Fuck the words you don't listen to em' anyway
Yeah, I struck a nerve sucka

Muhfucka might as well let my lips pucker like Elton John
'Cuz I'm just a mean cock sucka this shit is on
'Cuz you went and pissed me off, now I'm sittin' and pissin on
Everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So butt the Buddha light a bong but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song come on

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm as cold as a cold wind
Blows when it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why and man I just don't know

No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm as cold as a cold wind blows
I don't knowblo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh

Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon Bruce Banners back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle but I'm not fuckin' around

Muhfucka, I show your pussy footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt till' it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is it pushin'? You must have
Mistook me for some sissy soft punk

Lookin' for some nookie or bussum
Go ahead fuckin' hater push me
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cuz I hate a pussy

Man the fuck up sissy g's pull your car and just freeze up
Put your hoes down, shady ease up
Man, chill, nah I can't god dammit rap is a landfill
Drop that anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill

Shit the day that happens the world will stop spinning and Michael J
Fox will come to a stand still
During that earthquake, urine in your face cuz your fake
Ahhh, what the fuck that hurt, wait
Ahhh, what the fuck, I just got struck by lightning

Alright then I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do now forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you, you can repent
But I warn you, if you continue to hell I send you
And just then the wind blew and I said

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm as cold as a cold wind
Blows when it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why and man I just don't know

No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm as cold as a cold wind blows
Blo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh

How long will I be this way, shady, it's in my dying days
Till I hang up the mic and it's not for me to say
So long till then I drop the fuckin bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long

If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing a long slut, this slut that not the worst of this song
Oh, bitches don't like that
Homie, I'll be nicer to women when aquaman drowns
And human torch starts swimming

Man I'm a cold soul I roll solo so
Don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums
Yeah, I'm bananas pussy cut off the grapes and grow a pear

But I swear, you try to diss me I slaughter you
I'll put that on everything, like everyone does with autotune
The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm as cold as a cold wind
Blows when it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why and man I just don't know

No, no, no, no, no, no
I'm as cold as a cold wind blows
Blo, blo, blows blo, blo blows
Oh, oh, oh

I don't know, I don't know wat caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I dunno, I dunno but I'll probly be this way till my dying day
I dunno why I'm so, I'm so cold, mean things I don't need to say
I guess this is how you made me
