I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit

Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash whiskey and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to interscope?
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity

And bitches know me as a horny ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo)
That's what I said at my dad's funeral

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled

That's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill
We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with them too

That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibres here
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year

'Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen when a thousand bullets
Come at your house and collapse the foundation around you
And they found you and your family in it
God-damnit he meant it when he tells you

Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will
