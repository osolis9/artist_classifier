Everybody from the 313

Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free worlds got u all gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1pac , 2pac , 3pac , 4
4pac , 3pac , 2pac , 1
ur pac , hes pac, ur pac....none

This guy aint no muthafukin MC
I know everything hes got to say against me
I am white, i am a fukin bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy future is an Uncle Tom

I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all 6 of u chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
Im still standin here sayin FUCK THE FREE WORLD
Dont ever try to judge me dude
U dont know wat the fuck ive been through

But i know somethin about u
U went to Cranbrook, thats a private skool
Wats the matter dogg? u embarrased?
This guys a gangsta? he's real names Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage

This guy dont wanna battle, hes shook
Cuz theres no such thing as HALF-WAY CROOKS
He's scared to death
Hes scared to look in his fukin year book
Fuck Cranbrook

Fuck the beat, i go acapella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck yall if u doubt me
Im a piece of fukin white trash, i say it proudly
Fuck this battle, i dont wanna win, im outtie
Here, tell these people somethin they dont know about me
