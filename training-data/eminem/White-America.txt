America
Ha ha ha
We love you

How many people are proud to be
Citizens of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights of men
Who have died for the protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech
The United States Government has sworn to uphold
  (Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song)
Or so we're told

I never would a dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many mothafuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
Its like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched
So much anger aimed at no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays straight through your radio waves
It plays and plays till it stays stuck in your head
For days and days
Who would a thought standin' in this mirror
Bleachin' my hair wit some peroxide
Reachin' for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the fore front of rap like this
How can I predict my words and have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office
Cuz Congress keeps tellin' me
I ain't causin' nottin' but problems
And now they sayin' Im in trouble wit the government
I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumpin' it on

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like ourself
If they were brown
Shady lose, shady sits on the shelf, but shady is cute
Shady knew shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby
(Ooo baby)
Look at myself,
Lets do the math if I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No lables wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like 'Fuck it'
Until I met Dre, the only one who looked past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got was probably his in exchange
For every white fan that he's got like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like 'My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?'

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
These moms probly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
Till I created so much mothafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
Thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit me too 'cuz I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit a fine toothed comb
Its like this rope waitin' to choke tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
'I dont like this, no'
All I hear is lyrics, lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely 'Hip Hop' is never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch
And say faggot shit
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The mothafuckin' spokesman now

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get
Yea

(White America)
I could be one of your kids
  (White America)
Little Eric looks just like this
  (White America)
Erica loves my shit
I go to 'TRL'
Look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the damager aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it
With a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms Cheeney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freeness of speech
This divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Huh huh huh ahh)
(Oooh)
Ha ha ha
I'm just playin' America, you know I love you
