This motherfucker here, just won't shut up will you?
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me
I'm promoting you right now
Yo let's put the nail in his coffin

I don't want to be like this
I don't really want to hurt no feelings
But I'm only bein' real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap
(Nope)

And old men have heart attacks
And I don't want to be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An 83 year old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony
Without throwin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me

Please don't, you'll probably fall with me
And our asses will both be history
But then again you'll finally get your wish
'Cuz you be all over the street like 50 Cent

Fuckin' punk pussy fuck you chump
Gimme a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tryin' to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track that's how much you suck

Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at the source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can even get the clearances

'Cuz real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you, we hate you period
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand

Now he's a busta? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about incitements-bite me
Bitch I got two cases, and probation, fight me

What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists
Right in front of the only thing that you have in this world
A little girl?

And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no shoppin' rocks
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin' spots?

When you're the only white boy in that bitch just rippin'
Pressin' up your own flyers and your stickers stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinkos
Just makin' copys of your covers of cassette singles

To sell them out the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about bein' bullied over half your life?
Oh that's right, you should know what that's like, your half white

Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice, I'm eaten you alive inside
Jesus Christ, if you're that much of a gangster, put the mic down
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill 'em dead bitch

Shoot 'em in the fuckin' head, go ahead bitch
Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of you
'Cuz you're broke as fuck you suck you're a fuckin' joke

If you was really sellin' coke, well then what the fuck
You stop for dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make alot more money than you do from rap
You'll never had no security, you'll never be famous

You'll never now what it's like to be rich, lifes a bitch ain't it?
Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens
Terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this
And Canibus they usin' too many complicated fuckin words for you

Here then let me slow it down for you
So you can understand if I say it slower
Let it go dawg it's over

I don't want to be like this
I don't really want to hurt no feelings
But I'm only bein' real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap
(Nope)

And old men have heart attacks
And I don't want to be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

Haha
Talkin' 'bout I have motherfuckers callin' your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib
I love grandtheftauto liberty city stories for the PSP
Take it like a man and shut the fuck up
And fuck your little magazine too

I don't need your little fuckin' magazine
I got XXL's number anywayz
And y'all can't stand it 'cuz their gettin' bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the VMAs?

When you was watchin' me from whatever fuckin' TV
You was watchin' me from in Boston
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin' sissy

And you got us scared up in here motherfucker
Suck our motherfuckin' dicks
Oh, and for those that don't know, don't get it twisted yo
