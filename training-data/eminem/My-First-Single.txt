Ohh, yeah
So much for first single on this one

Shady's the label, aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of erra of course we're about to stir up
Some shit, thick as Ms. Buttersworth's syrup

It's the Mr. picked on Christopher Reeves
Just for no reason, other than just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest fan, he used to be Superman
Now, we're pourin' liquor on the curb in his name for him

Eminem, you wait till we meet up again
Fucker, I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said

It goes, one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo soldiers

I told ya, I'm about to blow so look out below
Geronimo, motherfuckers is dominoes
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know

Tryin' to pick up where the Eminem show left off
But I know, anything's possible though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game that shit is not gonna change

As long as I got Dr. Dre on my team, I'll get away with murder
I'm like O.J., he's at my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes in a safe, locked away
Better watch what you say

Just when you thought you were safe, them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God, you was playin' whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I coulda told ya to not do the same
'Cause one day, it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho

This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no

Erra, erra, Erick swallowed some generic sleepin' pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare naked
Jane [Incomprehensible] just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly, he, he, he, he, he, he

To be so young and naive
Oh, what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled
They cherish every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks

Hickory, dickory, Dirk Diggler, look at me work
Wizardry with these words
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken
Or jerkin' the chain?

22 jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle, jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
Allow me to run it back and rewind it
Let me ask you again

Am I just jerkin' the chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the damn camera?
Filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle

Just recently, somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin, videotapes of them fuckin'
When they were just musketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to the source with them

'Cause they coulda sworn someone said, â€½Nuhâ€
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it, you can hear the, uhh, uhh
And then they come to find out, it was Justin sayin, "I'm gonna cum"

And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho

This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no

Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics, I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker, I love to suck a dick

And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay, and make up with Ray

So, fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, ba, ca, ba, kawk
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick
In your mouth, I'm done you can fuck off, fucka, fuck off

And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho

This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no
