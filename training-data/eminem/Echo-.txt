Oh, all around the world
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know

All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Classical palms, battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron bad as I need a horn
Stabbing my clavicle bone, I'm at it or prone
First time I seen a Desert Eagle, I was letting the 44 buss
The 44 pop first time you seen one, you was eating Cocoa Puffs

Looking at Robocop, I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
In order to clean my things you need saline
I'm never refering to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang, vroom

Get respect from the get go, hello
Set to the echo, psycho, pen got a mind of its own
Gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song

As the echo follows the Maserati
As the petrol swallows
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
Check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant

I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep, right now I'm living a dream
Though we may be reckless, the ladies check us
They whisper Shady Records, baby echo

Oh, all around the world
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know

All the girls, the boys , they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling

I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time
I'm super human
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex, girl
You assuming cupid's looming
My mentality's caveman, stupid woman

My life is Truman Show, all I have is music, hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
'Cause you better put a fork in it
If you think I'ma lay here just spooning you
Oh, you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful

Diabolical, 'til the last molecule
Down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rhyming to the call, to the [unverified] all the way down to my sock
And the hair on my toe
Learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
'Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts
And saw my first pubic grow

I told these stupid hoes when I come back
I'ma set this bitch on fire
And this time I mean
I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her

'Cause this time, motherfuckers
I'm put my whole goddamn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hoe yet
I'ma go get tip and try to rip it wider

Oh, all around the world
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know

All the girls, the boys, they chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
