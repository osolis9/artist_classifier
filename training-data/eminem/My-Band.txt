I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous an' shit
'Cuz I'm like the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cuz once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby"
They're all like, "Oh, my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God dude, you fucking rock
Please Marshall please, let me suck your cock"

And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I  drop the beat and do my ocupellas
All the chicks start yellin', "All the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage"
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry

'Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryin' to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cuz I told him Jessica Albas my wife to be
This rockstar shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me
Because these

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cuz once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
MY band, baby

You just want to see a nigga backwards, don'tcha?
Hey man, how come we don't rap on Protools?
And smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in a van, and he in a tour bus
You want my autograph you's a liar
No, I'm Swift
(Oh, I thought you was Kuniva)

And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cuz our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
All I did was read a Russel Simins book
So I'm more intact tryin' to get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while gettin' whipped on my back

Look at 'em little punk ass, thinkin' he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself takin' all the pics
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for sound check
Man, I ain't goin' to sound check
But our mics are screwed up
And his always sound best

You know what man? I'ma say som'm
Aiyo 'em
You got som'm to say?
Man, nothin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man whasup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like and man shut up
You ain't even back me up and were supposed to be crew
Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
(I swear man)

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cuz once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers hot but the group is not
Once they've sold our arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut him mike off when the music starts
Aiyo, it's
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, 'Hey dude, I love your band"
We ain't a band bitch

We don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
Of these guys actin' funny over area codes
Proof carry my bag
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage security in the way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?

Goddamnit I'm sick of this group
It's time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack
Lose yourself video
(I was in the back)
Superman video
(I was in the back)

For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like who is D12, how we get started?
But what about Eminem? Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
Fitty told me do sit ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12 I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl, why can't you see you're the
Only one for me and it just
Tears my ass apart to know that
You don't know my name
(Punch)

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
(Haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
(Fuck Marshall)
'Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
(Yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer of my

My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
MY band, baby

I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance "My salsa"
Look out for my next single it's called, "My salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa"

My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa
Where'd everybody go?
