A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death, I don't wanna die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit

Look, I can't change the way I think
I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin' offa one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hop in the window, shoppin' the demo at gun point
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this

Livin' um up, never givin' a fuck, gimme the keys
I'm drunk and I've never drivin' the truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab

Come back the next week and reopen the scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Empty your four clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs

I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time

To all the weed that I've smoked, yo this blunts for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah fuck you too
To all the friends I use to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass

For all the drugs that I've done, yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended, ya fuck you too
Every time I reminisce, yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss
