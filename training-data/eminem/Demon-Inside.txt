[Intro]
uh huh. yo. alright, yo

[Verse 1] 
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleepin'
I keep dreamin' of death and I'm hearin' people screamin.
The devil's spirits trapped inside me and i want it out,
I'm on a couch, bleeding to death in a haunted house with both of my wrists slit
I'm lifted up in the air and suspended in animation like somebody's holding me there.
I feel somebodies cold hands wrapping around my neck, 
while i choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death. 
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches;
nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes. 
Trippin over O.D bodies of dead lushes,
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushies.
Doors open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves, 
the curtains catch fire; the house melts.
My skin blisters, and sticks together like twin sisters,
the wind blows, and shatters windows like ten twisters.
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple,
two cups of Holy water and I'm lookin' at em' half full.
But as soon as I go to touch em' they into red rum,
it got silent then all of these voices said...

[Voices]
"Come! Follow me into the pits of Hell!"

[Eminem]
I heard them yell

[Voices] 
"Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"

[End Verse]
I rang the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother,
covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel.
I said, "I need a room so I can try to get some rest." 
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag a cess
and told me that's just for starters;
Satan will be in to see me later, 
to see if I'm interested in being partners.
