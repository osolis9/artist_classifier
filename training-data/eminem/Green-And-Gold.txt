What would it take to push a man far enough?
To put somethin' material over a human life
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that?
The green and gold

I done filled my lungs up with so much of this crack smoke
My necks bloated, my techs loaded
I'm flat broke and I'm pissed off
Mad at the world, I've had it with girls
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop
Just made it and hopped on ready to drop bombs
On the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot John, a white collar worker in clean cut
Walked up to 'em, he was like, what?
Whatchu mean what? You know what time it is, man

At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch
With that diamond wrist band
Got his green and his gold, dashed it
Climbed in his van to steal it and seen a man holdin' a nine
And then shot him from the bottom up, stole his keys
Put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seat
