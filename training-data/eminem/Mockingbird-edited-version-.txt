Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not... always make sense to you right now
But hey, what'd daddy always tell you?
Straiten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone
But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
Cuz you're scared
I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it
Laynee, uncle's crazy ain't he
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
World we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mommy's always in the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together
Ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over
And that's what destiny is
Well no more worries
Rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up
Little lady, I told ya
Daddy's gonna hold ya
Through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy
Pretty baby
But I promise: momma's gonna be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em' under the tree
And said some of em' were from me
Cuz daddy couldn't buy em'
I'll never forget that christmas
I sat up the whole night cryin'
Cuz daddy felt like a bum
See daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time
Every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so that you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
Till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was starting to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' alot so momma moved back on the traumas on a falt
One bedroom appartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Navara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work
You and momma had to leave me
Then you started to see me on the TV
And momma didn't like it
And you an' Laynee were too young to understand it
Pappa was a rolling stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened to fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminising lookin' at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown it's almost like your sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty mucn are
And daddy's still here
Laynee I'm talking to you too
Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that cheer
It's got a ring to it don' it
Shh... momma's only gone for the moment

And if you ask me too daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'm gon' give you the world
I'm gon' buy a diamond ring for you
Imma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
Imma break that birdy's neck
I go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make em eat every carat, don't fuck with dad
