Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em "stick it"
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment

'Bout to go ham, yah, shout out to Kendrick

Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch!

Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch!

Take your shoes off
let your hair down and
(Go berserk)
All night long
Grow your beard out
Just weird out and
(Go berserk)
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke

So everybody, everybody (Go berserk), shake your body

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang - bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang dang
P-p-p pow pow chicka chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel toww
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh huh, how how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho...

Take your shoes off
let your hair down and
(Go berserk)
All night long
Grow your beard out
Just weird out and
(Go berserk)
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke

So everybody, everybody, get your vials
Scratches

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep
and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone,
car note!
Oh!
Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard! But don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Take your shoes off
let your hair down and
(Go berserk)
All night long
Grow your beard out
Just weird out and
(Go berserk)
All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go
Let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke

So everybody, everybody (Go berserk), get your vials

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go,
let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk), get your vials
