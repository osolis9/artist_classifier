Hail Mary 2003 (Ja Rule Diss)"(feat. 50 Cent, Busta Rhymes
[Chorus]
Come get me
If you mothafuckas want Shady
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na

[Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Miles like a .12 gauge shotti

[Chorus 2x]

[Eminem]
You ain't a killa, you a pussy
That exstacy got you all emotional and moushy
Bitches wearin rages in photos, Ja's words bein quoted
In the SOURCE, stealin 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouth, pray to god, hope that no one's listenin
See 50 comin for me, I'ma guard my, my position
No one will pay attention
To me, please Gotti, here I go
Gimme this pill, exstacy got me feelin so
Invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin mad man who screams
Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy
Actin like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fuck from this shit
I'm stuck, addicted from these drugs, I'ma quit
Sayin mothafucka's name's before someone fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you hell, fucker

[Eminem Sings]
Come get me
If you mothafuckas want Shady
If Pac was still here now,
He would never ride with Ja
Na, na, na, na ,na, na, na, na

Get off that E
Before you try to fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La, la, la, la , la, la, la, la

[50 Cent]
Temesentruries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time them bitch niggas is wastin
Insitutionalize, my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from the cell, G-Unit mothafucka, WE BALLIN
Catch me countin trees when I'm callin
Can you set my car, Ceo let me sip on Henessy, "Can I sips some more?"
Hell, I done been in jail, I ain't scared
Momma checkin in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Mothafuckas think they can stop 50... they losin it
Lil' nigga named Ja, thinks he live like me
Talkin about he left the hospital, took 9 like me

[50 Cent]
You lil fantasies nigga
I'll Reject your Deposit
When that lil sweet ass comin out of the closet
now he wonderin why DMX blow tha mouth
next time grown folks talkin bitch close your mouth
Peep me I take this war shit deeply
Seen too many real niggas ballin like these bitch niggas beat me
yous a mothafuckin punk and you see me with gloves
quit havin those fuckin kids with ya ulgy ass mom
and you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
but you and i know whats goin on Nigga pay back I know your bitch ass from way back 
Witness be strap with max You know I don't play that 
All these old rappers tryin to advance its all over now -- take it like a man
HAHA--Irv lookin like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
tryin to playa hate on my shit- made of fat dick
Lovin htis shit hats how you made me-feelin like I got you niggas crazy, i like
Against all odds up with my dogs mothafuckas now 
It'll be the realist shit I ever wrote 
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin blow to the truest shit i ever spoke???

[Busta Rhymes:]
Hey yo I'm one of tha most humble, rep the streets to tha core
Hey Jeffrey, What the fuck you come involve with me for?
You spent a long time comin like a bless and a check
you see 106 and park fans don't even fuckin respeck you
Its kinda funny when ya be pol fake like like you thug
runnin around talkin shit that he ain't even capable of
now let me OFF this cock sucka watch me handle you nigga
If i recall Violator use to manage you nigga then took a closer look and 
realized you was an empostor theres never been a Violator on a Murda Inc rosta. Dumb ass
now who shoop?-- Ah made you look, you said Busta in the same oh hook, You Stupid
if yall shoot I take a look at ya man tha bitch shot himself infront of Def Jam
chedda bar bass nigga start adjustin ya plan
you let the streets down nigga-(a) Pologize to ya fans
watch ya pull a lil stunt like we ain't know where you are ya lil fanny 
desperate be tryin while we establish a buzz I know tha shit is drivin you crazy You wonderin how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then i'm beefin with you
I think about tha game and what a slight AH--WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT YOU
You finished I ain't tryin to complete this just because I'm cool shouldn' 
take my kindness for weakness

[Busta speakin in background]
Ooh shit ha ha That was fun Next time you got a problem with me, Address me 
before you make shit a public issue and i'm gone, return back to my regular 
self and have fun again
-One
