Ayo, before I start this song man
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient
And baring with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

Yeah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away I guess to open up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
What I was going through growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins
On the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne

It's like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too

God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic
Thank god that I didn't do it
I would of had my ass handed to me
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it

Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying
Your health is declining with your self esteem, you're crying out for help

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin' self loathing and hollow
Bottoms up of pill bottle maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow

But I must be talkin' to the wall though
I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater I've put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not a egomaniac, that's not his motto

He's not a desperado, he's desperate, it's startin' to bottle
Inside 'em, one foot on the brake one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mc Donalds
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it

Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded you pouted long enough
It isn't them it's you you fuckin', baby
Quit worrying about what they do and do fuckin' Shady
I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

So I pick myself off the ground and fuckin' slam before I drown
Hit my bottom so hard I bounce twice suffice this time around
It's different them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come up to make it up to you no more fucking around
I've got something to prove to fans I feel like I let em down

So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you
For those of you who don't know
The new mes back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowin' up, pullin' up, blowin' up, all over no mo
My life is no longer a movie but the shows aint over homos

I'm back with a vengeance homie Weezy keep ya head up
TI keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up
Don't let up, just keep slayin' 'em
Rest in Peace to DJ AM 'cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I come from

Can anybody hear me?
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself
It feels like I'm going insane
Am I the one whose crazy?

So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one

So here it is, dang, this feels like I just woke up or somethin'
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, ma
Ay, yo, is anybody I thought about goin' at
'Twas never nothin' personal
'Cause of some shit I was goin' thru', it's everybody else
I'm back, ay, yo
