Once again it's the sinister cynical minister Shady
Grip the knife to Superman he's a dinister Amy
Administer of the pain just finished huffin the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin because it ain't
Anything in his way his enemies he just slays his venom he sprays breeches like pins of energy rays
Menacing stares he glares making the hairs all on the back of your neck stand like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep he's a tarantula gargantuan yeah Angela so I command ya to start dancin
Part Manson part Hannibal part mechanical sharp
Throwin animal parts at Scarlet Johanson
Into my gas chamber yeah gangster my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck he's set to strangle your ass hater you're facin the task raider
He's chasin your ass he's got his face in the mask and bloodstains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure of o-dosing me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing
Windows opening shutting doors opening closing
I think there's a ghost too much hydrocordone and codeine
I was only s'posed to swallow a half I took the whole thing
I'm not joking
I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink I'm standing over the sink posing
Myself self loathing cause I'm on the brink mostly
I don't wanna think this'll make everything rosy
Beverly sings screams while I'm severing three tosies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodeling "Rosy! Won't you come out to play? "
Illusions wasting time cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofins in my syrup and stirred em
You never heard him
Like this so don't encourage him the neurosurgeon
Coke beers and lyrics worsen
The kinda person to give Katy Kuric to Kirsten
80 spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turned him
Invincible he emerged and
Took over the world and
Reeled in all the children
Lured em into the buildin and killed em
Buried em in the mulch and mildew
And he will do what he feels
And still can spin straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk mulch into Tylenol three pills
The real Slim Shady's entered the buildin
It's nothin but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch Mildred he's I'll with it
He still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he MCs'll still get freakin seed on the grill then
