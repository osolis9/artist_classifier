Once you call my name out
Things will never be the same
They should have never let us
Get off foot in this game

Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin' a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it

So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode and
Have another episode where I let it go
As far as the one with Benzino did

I'm waitin' for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fuckin' pole vault with

Oh, shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name, it's a game
'Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame

Everyday, it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy, buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin' to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp

They after that Shady, aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally
Understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin' jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin' lottery

And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other?
In time we discovered that we have more in common
Then we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers

Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
'Cause we started thinkin' God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers
Who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause

Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives, he's gettin' dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin'
Even if I'm under the gun

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit

Still gonna conduct motherfuckin' business as usual
Ego's aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nike's, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats

Stompin', I been rompin'
Since Tim Dogg was hollerin' 'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin'
Back when they was still makin' Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet

That tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky Ticky Toc, Ticky Ticky Toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stop
