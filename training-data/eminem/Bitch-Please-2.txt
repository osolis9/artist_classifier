Yeah, what up Detroit
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh no he didn't
They didn't do it again
Wha-wha-wha-what?
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw ya smell that, this is special right here
Wha-wha-wha-what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Aww yeah, y'know, what's crackin' Dre

Just let me lay back and kick some ol' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard
When it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach?
Came a long way, to making these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre but I

Somehow, some way
Holla nigga, you know about Dogg-ay
Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where the fuck I'm coming from
I get the party cracking from the shit that I be spitting, son
Hit-and-run, get it done
Get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang
Damn baby girl what's your name
I forgot, what'd you say it was, damn a nigga buzzed
Hanging in the club with my nephew Eminem
What up 'cause
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the King of the motherfucking West Coast, baby

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with Gods
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standing over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shooting with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Aww naww, big Slim Dogg, eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby, he's Shady
He's so crazy
Gimme the mic, let me recite 'till Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right, I'm just a criminal
Making a living off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreaming at night of screaming at mom, scheming to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD using the "fag" word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
"Suck my fucking dick, you faggot", you happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a 44

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

2001 and forever
Slim Shady
Dr. Dre
Snoop Dogg
X to the Z
Nate Dogg
Come on!
Yeah
