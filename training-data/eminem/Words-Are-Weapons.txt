My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's stepping to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never did show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's stepping to me

Yo, the rage I release on a page
Is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fucking stick of dynamite

[Unverified] I get behind the mic
It's like the wick is lit, you bitches die tonight
My nine is like a guiding light at night, shining bright
My fucking grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych

These cock sucking cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon
Man, the shit's depressing
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
(Come on, Slim, let's go and teach this fucking bitch a lesson)

They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative, baby, hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfucking suckers you're a soldier get up
Stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathing
They jealous of you, man, that's the only reason they beefing

It's that Dirty Dozen renegade
You done pulled the pin out my grenade
38s'll move your shit up out the way
You niggas won't forget about McVeigh, you got something to say?
Let it out today or watch these bullets spray

From these ten black fingers hugging these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm 'Dirty', so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater

You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
You packing something special in your crib, then bitch, get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
(Uh huh)
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils

You get splitted and guess what? I'm blowing up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Finding whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents

I'm eating crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper
(Why not?)
I only fuck animals
(Oh, haha)
Stupid trick got my dick starting to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch

One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your honor)
Six times I been arrested, how would you feel?
If you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?
(It happens)

I'm smoking dank, drinking, drank
I can't have any kids 'cause I'm fucking shooting blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?
Nicole's a whore, I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut
(Uhh)

Responsibility, I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President
(Ohh, hey)
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi-zarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shitting diarrhea

My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
