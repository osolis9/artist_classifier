So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Feigned to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it

I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert

I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up like a sewin' machine
But I was losin' my freedom
There was no where for me, to not go and be seen
And just go and be me

And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest

'The Marshall Mathers' was a classic
'The Eminem Show' was fantastic
But 'Encore' just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be 'Ill-matic'

And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin' pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it and if you get it
Then you just might not know what to do wit' it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten fold

I said, be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it and if you get it
Then you just might not know what to do wit' it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten fold

I got a letter from a fan that said he's been prayin' for me
Everyday and for some reason
It's been weighin' on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But somethin' told me to go ahead and open it

But why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at

I've already told you at least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look nuts

And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it and if you get it
Then you just might not know what to do wit' it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten fold

I said, be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it and if you get it
Then you just might not know what to do wit' it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten fold
