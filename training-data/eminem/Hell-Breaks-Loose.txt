I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumpin'
I want them fists pumpin' in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?

Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs

Can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison

So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin

'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
Da dee da dee da da dee
He makes it look so easy
Girl you just hit the lottery

Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do

Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose

This is where shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Then chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say, and once it's over like a seance, it hums

It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smokin' something
You think I ain't smokin' nothin, stay off my nuts

Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse

D-R-E is on the loose
I'm like a goose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose

Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to extract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your man's like in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose

Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do

Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose

Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow, liquid courage up in the blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go

We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block with your hoe
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc
Can proceed to drop me and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

Yeah, so let us in before we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out your
Revenge is so sweet, move it 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably

Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, my sayings are sewers in the streets

Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce deuce in the seat, Dre fall off?
That's news to me

Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do

Everywhere we go, it seems we looking
For any excuse to just cut loose
So this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
