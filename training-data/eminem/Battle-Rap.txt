This guy's a choke artist
Ya catch a bad one
Your better off shootin yourself
With Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin up this mountain your weak
Ill leave you lost without a paddle
Floatin shits creek

You ain't Detroit, Im the D
Your the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks
Fuckin Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music

Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his asscrack
And when you actin up thats when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

Ill crack your shoulder blade
Youll get dropped so hard
Elvis will start turnin in his grave
I dont know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile
To the trailor park

This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
Its all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So Im a German, Eh
Thats ok, you look like a fuckin worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies

Talkin bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek
With paddles this deep
Your still gonna sink
Your a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit
This is a turtle race

He can't get with me spittin this shit
Wickedly lickety shot
Spickety spickety split lickety
So Im gonna turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!

{lotto}
I'll spit a racial slur honky sew me
this shit is a Horror flick but a black guy doesn't die in this movie.
fucking with lotto dawg you gotta be kiddin'
that makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'.
you think these bitches gonna feel the shit you say
i got a better chance joining the kkk
on some real shit though i like you
thats why i didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
fuck lotto call me your leader
i feel bad that i gotta murder that dude from leave it to beaver
i used to like that show now you got me in fight back mode
but oh well if you gotta go then you gotta go
i hate to do this i would love for this shit to
last so i'll
take pictures of my rear end so you wont forget my ass
and all's well that ends okay
so i'll end this shit with a fuck you and have a nice day

{B Rabbit}
Ward, I Think you were a little hard on the beaver
so was Eddie Hasko, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This Guy keeps screaming he's paranoid
quick someone get his ass another steroid
blah badi boo blah bah badi bloo blah
I ain't hear a word you said
Hipidi hoo bla
Is that a tank top or a new bra
look snoop dogg just got a fuckin' boob job
didn't you listen to the last round meat head
pay attention, you're sayin the same shit that he said
matter fact dogg heres a pencil
go home write some shit make it suspensful
and don't come back until something dope hits you
fuck it you can take the mic home with you
looking like a cyclone hit you
tank top screaming lotto i dont fit you
you see how far these white jokes get you
Boy's like how vanilla ice gonna diss you
my motto fuck lotto
i'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow(ohhhhhhhhh)

Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up and follow me
Now everybody from the 313 put your motha fuckin' hands up
Look look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The Free World's got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac 2 pac 3 pac 4
4 pac 3 pac 2 pac 1
You're pac he's pac You're pac none

This guy ain't no motha fuckin MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white I am a fuckin' bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screamin' fuck the Free World

Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook
Thats a private school
What's the matter dog?
You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster?
His real names' Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage

This guy dont wanna battle hes s'Cause there ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look at his fuckin year book
Fuck Cranbrooke

Fuck a beat I'll go a capella
Fuck a Papa Doc
Fuck a clock
Fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody
Fuck ya'll if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fuckin' white trash I say it proudly
And fuck this battle I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people somethin' they don't know about me
