Tell myself that I was doing alright<br />
There's nothing left to do tonight<br />
I go crazy on you, crazy on you<br />
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you<br />
<br />
Can't you see what you do to me baby?<br />
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac<br />
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick<br />
You're truly the only one who can do this to me<br />
You just make me get so crazy<br />
<br />
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic<br />
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanna sex<br />
You make me crazy, the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sack<br />
We fuck like 2 jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit<br />
<br />
'Cuz the next day we're right back at it in the same exact pattern<br />
What the fuck is the matter with us, we can't figure out if it's lust<br />
Or it's love is what's attracting us to each other<br />
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother<br />
<br />
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch<br />
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today<br />
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you<br />
Just 'cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you<br />
<br />
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby<br />
Because you stay with me, maybe, 'cuz you're as crazy as I am<br />
'Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes<br />
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side<br />
<br />
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises<br />
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators<br />
And dildos, you fuck yourself so much, you barely feel those anymore<br />
You're only 24 but you're plenty more [Incomprehensible]<br />
<br />
Sure than those other little hoes who just act like little girls<br />
Like theyre in middle school, still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'<br />
You play your position, you never step out of line<br />
Even though I stay in your business, you've always kept out of mine<br />
<br />
I wonder what's on your mind sometimes<br />
They say love is blind<br />
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye<br />
You ain't see the sign<br />
<br />
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved<br />
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love<br />
I go crazy on you, crazy on you<br />
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you<br />
<br />
You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad<br />
The moral, the very fiber the whole substance to my rap<br />
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence<br />
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this<br />
<br />
As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much<br />
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do<br />
You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire<br />
You're my entire supply gas, the match, and igniter<br />
<br />
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs<br />
To my table, if you were to break I'd fall on my face<br />
But I am always gonna make you feel I don't need you<br />
As much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage<br />
<br />
But you are essential to me, you are the air I breathe<br />
I believe if you ever leave me, I'd probably have no reason to be<br />
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you are the Slim to my Shady<br />
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Haillie<br />
<br />
You are the word that I am looking for when I'm trying to describe<br />
How I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind<br />
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me<br />
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me<br />
<br />
You are like the root to my evil<br />
You let my devil come out me<br />
You let me beat the shit out you<br />
Before you beat the shit out me<br />
<br />
And no matter how much too much is never enough<br />
Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love<br />
I go crazy on you, crazy on you<br />
Lemme go crazy, crazy on you
