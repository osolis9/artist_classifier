Yeah, yeah, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's all so cold, all so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

Fe fi fo fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target with my car and park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider
Hi there, girl, you mighta heard of me before
See whore, you're the kinda girl that I'da
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella, then open it up while that shit's inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, and now let's see her have triplets and I'll
Incinerate them babies soon as they're out her with formaldehyde
Hide in cyanide, girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin' I'd rather go vin-vin and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, ahh
Shit, wait a minute, I mean skull, my knife seems dull
Pull another one out, ooh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide and seek like Jason, I'm so hungry

She's naked, see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Close the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatantly but silently 'cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's wakin' me so violently and why's he on top of me?
"He's rapin' me", she tries to scream
"Somebody please get him off me"
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny"
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me
She's scratchin' like some dumb freak

Escapin' me, no die, she see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake

Better try to stay wide awake
Or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitches soul, I'ma try to take
Pray for light today, right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much
Might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how about now while you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours till outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement now?
Ya must've just heard the sound
Of my stomach growlin' from down there

Holler, there's no one fowler
Bound to the tub they found ya' face down in the tub
I drowned you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cowered
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' 'Star Wars'

Jaba the hut, be, de, ba, ba, be, de, ba, ba, it's time to die, die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazin' when grazin' skin with these razorblades he waves at ya'
Not your everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water

Nothin' like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt?
There's no fun in that, here I come with ax
Fun to act like lumberjack, when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 911, someone's comin' in from the back

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
Stay wide awake
