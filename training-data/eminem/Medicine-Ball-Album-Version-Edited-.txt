Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the TriBeCa
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector

I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I buy sex and erect ya'
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya'
I tantalize ya' and in less then 5 seconds I get ya'

They say once bitten and twice shy
Well, I'm next to the guy with 9 ecstasy pills and 5 extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities
Why? Yes sir, I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser

That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess, I'll dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

All my West Side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, quief and blow it up
Man, I think that Eggers fell off the tip, didn't show enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up

Man, you've seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no, you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole, you kiddin'?

I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I'll do what I wanna
Spray perfume in a sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man who would've thought I

Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man?
Grab a hold of this branch with both hands
Man, they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
This name rhymes with so many different words, geez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please

Eminem, I'm coming to kill you
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

The world is mine
