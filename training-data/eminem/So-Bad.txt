Yeah, you feel that, baby?
Yeah, I feel it too
Damn, you know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was, am I?

I'm the American dream, I'm the definition of white trash ballin'
I'm right back on 'em with a
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling

Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
Whatchu' mean we ain't fuckin'? You take me for a friend?
Lemme tell you the whole story, of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again

Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my momma
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word of Johnny drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I'm making a promise

There ain't nobody as bomb as me, I'm calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knee's, his legs, and his arms
I'ma superstar, girl, I'm ready for you momma
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo
First I'll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you ain't foolin' from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying, April

I'mma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake g's
Skip over the huggy bear and all the kissy face please
Initiate phase 3, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously

Take your time, baby, oh, you're the bomb, baby
Oh, you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I'm shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Relax, woman, you know that I'm only kiddin' with you
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't hit ya
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm just

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I can hold you in the morning but in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl and the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh

I got you caught up in the raps, yeah
Make you recap the feelings you had for your last boyfriend
Before he slapped ya, you never wanted someone so bad
Ya sweatin' but if I'm what you wanted
Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?

Girl, don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can't ignore it so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'

Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that you
Couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup

So stop with the store pick up line ups
Lets get the pineapple schnapps going
No one will knock as long as I hang a sign up sayin' 'Don't disturb'
Shawty, I'm so superb, I say the right things
Don't I speak the dopest words?

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I'm dynamite, dynamite, dynamite
I can hold you in the morning but in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl and the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

So bad, I'm so good, man, I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
