'Cause the more you, put me through
The more makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me
i just love you more
you dont want me
i just want you more
i buy you flowers, throw'em at me
i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
the more that you slap me
the more that it turns me on
'cause you love me, and i love you more
It's sick
but who could ever predict
we'd be doing the same shit
we say we do it for our baby
but we don't, we do it for us
it's lust,
'Cause neither one of us trust eachother so
we fuck, ti'll we bust then we cuss eachother
out
we know what it's about,
shout, till i throw you out the house
you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch
fist fight till we turn this mother OUT
and apologize after
laughter, pain, it's insane
we're back in the same chapter again

and its sad but its true

when im layin' here with you

there ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do
cause.
the more you
put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me
i just love you more
you dont want me
i just want you more
buy you flowers
throw'em at me
i know its sad but its making me happy
the more that you slap me
the more that it turns me on
cause you love me
and i love you more
