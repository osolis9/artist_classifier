I'll be

The way you shake it
I can't believe it
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

I don't believe it
It's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shakin' that ass to the new Nelly Jams
I think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying freeze, da-doing doing doing

What do you mean freeze? Please I'm a human being
I have needs, I'm not done not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mister officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer
I just like to pee, pee, pee

Yes I make R 'n' B
I sing song that go ringy chong
Ching chong chong chong ching
Psyche, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry please, please forgive
For I am triumph the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

The way you shake it
I can't believe it
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

Jessica Simpson
Looks oh so temptin'
Nick I ain't never seen a ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV
My pee pee goes
Da-doing doing doing

Mary Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they gettin' older, they startin' to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying freeze, da-doing doing doing

What do you mean freeze? Jeez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look I put it away my zipper zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman
This movie is P.G. mister officer, I demand to see my attorney

I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer is with Michael?
He's too busy, I'm triumph
Britney spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you laugh
'Cos there's a puppet on my hand

The way you shake it
I can't believe it
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

Hilary Duff is
Not quite old enough so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass
And she'll make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

The way she moves she dances like a gogo
In that video she sings 'Get out' you bozo
I need a new boyfriend, 'Hi my name is Jojo'
Police saying freeze, da-doing doing doing

What do you mean freeze?
My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just baked cookies
Mister officer, lookie, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me

I don't even know if I can say the word pee-pee
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psyche, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee
Quick get to the chopper, everybody get down
I'm not Triumph, I'm Arnold get down

The way you shake it
I can't believe it
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it
You make my pee pee go
Da-doing doing doing

So Gwen Stefani
Will you pee-pee on me please?
I ain't never seen a ass like that
'Cos the way you move it
You make my pee-pee go
Da-doing doing doing

Fuck is wrong with you
