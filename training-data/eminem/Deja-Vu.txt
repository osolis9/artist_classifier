As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate

Start off with the NyQuil like, "I think I'll just have a taste"
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, "Yeah, that's great"
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight

Now, I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
"Mommy, something's is wrong with Dad I think"

"He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car
Eating 'Three Musketeers' in the rear seat"

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I tried but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?
That's the devil in my ear, I been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me, he's all I can fuckin' hear
"Marshall, come on we'll watch the game
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"

And maybe if I just drink half
I'll be half buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale, man, I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine

Yeah, I know but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out 'cause I didn't feel the ground at all

Wow, what the fuck happened last night? Where am I?
Man, fuck, am I hungover? And goddamn I've got a headache
Shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please stand by

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I tried but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die

Oh ya, there's an excuse, you lose proof, so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducin' a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?

Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps

Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Okay, so now you see the reason how come he

Has taken four years just to put out an album B
See me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath
'Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
It was bologna, was it the methadone ya think?

Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide, ain't it? So you can lie to Haley
 I'm going beddy, bye Whitney baby, goodnight Elaina

Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
And wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door

Kinda feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I tried but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why I just don't know
