Shady, Aftermath
G-G-G-G, G-Unit!

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hanging on the edge of your seat, get on down

Times up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you going crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you

We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playing the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissing and moaning, whining and bitching
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond

Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbing

First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk
(Get it crunk, crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it

I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
(We keep the party rocking off the hinges
We ain't showing off, we just going off popular consensus)
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressing?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessing
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)

We gon' have this mutherfucker hopping in a second (Bump bump)

That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers

Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap, maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the, back
And forth all day like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

First we came here to set this party off right

Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without

At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

50 Cent, come on!
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sundays
And palm trees Cali, every day it's just another party
From the valleys, all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
(Let's rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week)
You could catch me in the studio banging out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady/Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the. the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better, we tear the club up
And leave without a shred of evidence and uh

First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Yeah, still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry 'bout that Detox album
It's coming, we gon' make Dre do it
HAHA!
50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leaving, let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out, peace!
