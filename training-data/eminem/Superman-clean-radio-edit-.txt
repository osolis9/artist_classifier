You high baby?
"Yeah"
Yeah?
"Ha ha ha, talk to me"
You want me to tell you somethin'?
"Uh huh"
I know what you wanna hear

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Oh boy, you drive me crazy"
Chick you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it prick
Babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' spit
Girl you can jump on Shady's "ohhh"
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell a mo'fuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, chick why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' sh
Wouldn't pss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Chickens they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that empty runway, oww

'Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman

I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these girls
It's no secret everybody knows
Yeah we fd, prick so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
You'll never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what girls do
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fd you

But I do know one thing though
Chickens they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that empty' runway, oww

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too

I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me, baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you

I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Oh boy, you drive me crazy"
Chick you make me hurl

First thing you said
"I'm not phazed"
"I hang around big stars all day"
"I don't see what the big deal is anyway"
"You're just plain ol' Marshall to me"

Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
"Hailie Jade? I love that name"
"Love that tattoo, what's that say?"
"Rotten pieces?"
"Aww that's great"
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll pump you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave footprints all across you
Good lordy-wody, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Oooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put on a Tampax
And you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Chickens they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass
On that empty runway, oww

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby"
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl

You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
"Oh boy, you drive me crazy"
No, chick you make me hurl
