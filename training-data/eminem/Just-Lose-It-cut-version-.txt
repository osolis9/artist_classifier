Encore
Just Lose It (cut version)
Eminem making sounds) 

ok.. 
Guess who's back 
Back again 
Shady's back 
tell a friend 

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright Stop...Pajama time 

Verse 1: 
Come here little kiddies,On my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And i don't mean rap as in a new case of child investigation accusation 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
now worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
what else could i possibly do to make noise 
I'd an touched on everything, but little boys 
That's not a stab at Micheal 
That's just a metaphore, I'm just physco 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good god, dip, do a little slide 
Band down, touch your toes and just glide 
Up the center of the dance floor 
Like teepee from my bum hole in the school if you let one go 
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little "poot poot", it's ok (Fart Sound) 
Oops my cd just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip 

Chorus: 
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
It's your chance 
Yeah boy shake that thang, 
Oops i mean girl girl girl girl 
Girl you know you're my world 
Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah 

Verse 2: 
It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to sunday 
Maybe till monday, i dunno what day 
Everday's just a holiday 
Crusin' on the freeway 
Feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where i'm goin' 
All I know is when i get there 
Someones gonna say "touch my body" 
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomache and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...ewww 
What's your name girl 
What's your sign 
Dr Dre: Man, you must be up out your mind 
Dre aah aah 
Dear god 
Goes blind 
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm

Chorus: 
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
It's your chance 
Yeah boy shake that thang, 
Oops i mean girl girl girl girl 
Girl you know you're my world 
Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah 

Verse 3: 
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and i don't know what happend 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
boy we got you on tape 
yelling at old lady, touch my body 
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It's really intense, no one makes a sound 
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
A step back to reality 
Look it's B.Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle 
I'm a grown man 
Duba duba duba duba duba duba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Duba duba duba duba fella's what? fella's what? 
Grab you left, make right one jealous what? 
Black girls 
White girls 
Skinny girls 
Fat girls 
Tall girls 
Small girls 
I'm calling all girls 
Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romentor 
But squeezin it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah 
It's so appealing 

Chorus: 
Now I'm gonna make you dance 
It's your chance 
Yeah boy shake that thang, 
Oops i mean girl girl girl girl 
Girl you know you're my world 
Alright now lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Just lose it 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Go crazy 
Aah aah aah aah aah 
Oh baby 
Aah aah 
Oh baby baby aah aah
