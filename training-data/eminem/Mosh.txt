People, it feels so good to be back
Mosh with me now

You scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'ma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a father-less past

Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin' and jugglin' both
Perhaps mastered his craft slash entrepreneur
Who has helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure
Movin' past that Mr. 'Kiss his ass crack'
He's a class act, rubber band man yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form this stomp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
No matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same 'cause no matter the weather

If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now, more then ever
They tell us, "No", we say, "Yeah", they tell us, "Stop", we say, "Go"
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, c'mon, just

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on

Imagine it pourin', it's rainin' down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryin' to tell us somethin'
Maybe this is God, just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward that we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this
Without pumpin' our fists, now this is our final hour

Let me be the voice, and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it and multiply it by sixteen million
People are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a high anarchy
Strap him with a AK 47, let him go fight his own war
Let him impress Daddy that way

No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare to trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, its all lies the stars and stripes have been swiped Washed out and wiped and replaced with his own face
Mosh now or die, if I get sniped tonight
You'll know why, â€~cuz I told you to fight

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I wont steer you wrong
Put your faith in your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
Come on

And as we proceed to mosh through this desert storm
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ as we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army to disarm this weapon
Of mass destruction that we call our President
For the present and mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard, Mr. President, Mr. Senator
