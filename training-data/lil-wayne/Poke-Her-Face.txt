She said, said she can fuck me right
I made her fuck her friend
She say don't call her a dike
Well, that's gay

I met her on Monday and fucked her all week
'Cause every time she leave she come back to the tree
She know I love brain so I treat her like a geek
She love the way I spit so I made the pussy gleet

Wildin' with my niggas and I don't give a fuck
So I circle the bitches, we rounding them up
I treat her like I need her, I'm knowing if I eat her
She gon' tell Quieta and Quieta like the media

Woopty woo to the bloods
Her lipstick match my flag that swag
Weezy F baby, got lust that drag
I put 'em in your mouth till you choke and gag

I poke her face off
And now she faceless
I poke her so much
I deserve a bracelet

So that relationship is over once I poke her

So I gave her a tour of the tour bus
It was all lust on the tour bus
'Cause she did all us on the tour bus like
