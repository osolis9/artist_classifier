This is 4 the hood
This is 4-tha ghetto

That Cash Money, that 100 million Dollar money

[Rick Ross]

Rydin big, getting mine
2 microwaves cook a brick at a time
Bandanna on the handle ready 4 the whip (whip it)
When I wet it while it's soft watch it disappear (boss)
I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear bet the boss looks so bright (so bright)
4 life (4 life) dope boi (dope boi) mo strips (O boi)
Rydin low, getting high
80 round drums lets u know the time
When u c the maybach nigga know its mine
Rydin on two 4Â's im ahead of my time (watch)
1 of a kind, another 1 on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand is you hoe on the line
In the hood hoe nigga act funny
Only real nigga can touch cash money

[Cool and Dre] [Chorus]

I spent about 100million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto, ghetto
And I came from the ghetto, ghetto
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto

[Birdman]

#1
Everyday a new whip homie
So you know I get my shine on
Flip after we flip homie
So you know I get my grind on (bird call)
Birdman daddy, pullin up
In the brand new caddy
Got money living lavish
Got bitches shippin packages
Move them thangs, get then thangs
Switch that lane, get that chain
Flip them thang, get your money homie

See I got like 10 times (bird call)
Spent money got like 10 times (bird call)
Flip that got it like 10 times (bird call)
Got money like 10 mo times

[Cool and Dre] [Chorus]

I spent about 100 million dollars
100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto, ghetto
And I came from the ghetto, ghetto
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto

[Young Jeezy]

I from the ghetto, bottom, tha hood, da slum
Its money out here what you trying to get sum
Cool like Dre, A like K
When you talk about me better watch what you u say
Don't ever keep them thangs where you lay
Because them p***y as nigga sho the feds where u stay
You thought your dog said he was a G
Sound like another codefendant to me (Ha, Ha)
Stop it I really donÂ't like him
Run and get everybody inedited
Saw da s**t coming
You thought I was psychic
Fuck around and fight it

[Lil Wayne]

I all night it (all night it)
I everyday it (everyday it)
When it comes to my dudes
I over pay it (paid it)
Rated hood b***h
Bitch im hood
I aint asshole but im on sum hood s**t
I wish I would switch
I don't know how
Blood gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't cost 100 thou

[Cool and Dre] [Chorus]

I spent about 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto, ghetto
And I came from the ghetto, ghetto
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto, throw your hood up
If your ghetto

[DJ Khaled]
