Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Uh

Hollygrove, Hollywoood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

Find out where your parents stay tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the bible's a comic book
Bitch this is Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name
Call it milk, because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist, so somebody better monitor the thermometer

I just eat pussy and pussy ass nigga's all day and I ain't even kinda full

Hollygrove, Hollywoood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits, I'll show you my weapon and grill, and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom, she lay down and say "let's make a film"
I be like action, I hold her head down by her neck this breath-taking film
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop close range hold that gun like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch ridin' my dick, she swerve cuz another bitch grabbin' the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me say shut up, I say my lips are sealed
I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in heaven when hell was a pile of wood
I run through hell, with gasoline drawers won't stop tell the devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop is off, vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, everyday Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing wallabees
Well paparazzi, I need my privacy, fuck yo photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get the good side of me, Lawwwd
I come from Hollygrove, Hollywood should make a movie about Hollygrove
Whoo, whoever play me should get a Oscar and a golden globe
This ain't no movie, this is real shit, I don't need a script cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed, thought she could snort more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets but got superstar written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove, I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bapapapaapapappa I ain't finna shoot and tell them don't check the gate
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots, wake up and smell the emabalmic fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her, she say "Hallelujah"
Hollygrove to far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
I done went way far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
Lord please don't let this car break down

H-Town! Lord, Ive done went from Hollygrove to H-town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th ward bitch that be boostin
Sometimes she doze off, that's the lean I excuse it
She said "If it ain't chopped and screwed, It ain't music"
She say I never take her out, We went to eat at Houstons
Sometimes I doze off, that's the lean, I'm just snoozin
I still got actavist, nigga thats exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life had to do this for Houston

Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying the car don't break down
Oh, Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don't give police no names or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught, they gon put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with the chopper leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper, protecting my livelihood, I'm so good, I'm so straight, I'm secure
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
