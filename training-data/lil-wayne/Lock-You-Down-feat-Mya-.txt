Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, sir
What it is?
See this right here is automatic man, understand that
See what you know bout Scott Storch got torch
And Weezy F got fiyah, yes
And we bringin' back Ms. Mya, get it

If I had a dollar for all of the times
I thought I found the right one
I'd be a billionaire and then I could probably ride out
And go and find the right one
I wouldn't mind a dude that could take my attitude
And take the time to listen
Someone that understands when I need a lil space
And when I need attention
But I'm lookin' for a real

Somebody with direction (direction)
Somebody with affection (affection)
That knows how to put it on me
That's what I need (that's what I need)
Somebody who could read me, check me, when I need to be (oh yeah)
Pick me up when I'm fallin'
That's what I need

So when I find you, I'll never let you get away
Neva let you slip away
I'mma lock you down, lock you down
When I see you, I'll never look the other way
Neva let you slip away
I'mma lock you down, lock you down

Uh uh uh
I hope she throw away the key too
Got me tied up like a three piece suit
Uh Mya's back gotta sweet tooth
Miss Caramel I need three scoops
I could see you in ya beach suit
Walkin' round my beach view
Three bedroom penthouse see through
Just windows rich as nemphos, hey girl
I can tell where ya need to go
Where you ought to be
On the charter comin' to young carter
You need direction, I could take you further
You need affection, I could crush you harder
You need protection, protection?
Sweetheart I'm fresh off election
And if you checkin' I won't be far
I'll be right on yo radar

So when I find you, I'll never let you get away
Neva let you slip away
I'mma lock you down, lock you down
When I see you, I'll never look the other way
Neva let you slip away
I'mma lock you down, lock you down

Like an anchor in the water
I got my priorities in order
It means you be the only one love in my life
I will vow to never leave ya
Rub ya back boy do anything to please ya
All you gotta do is come around
And I'mma lock you down

So when I find you, I'll never let you get away
Neva let you slip away
I'mma lock you down, lock you down
When I see you, I'll never look the other way
Neva let you slip away
I'mma lock you down, lock you down
