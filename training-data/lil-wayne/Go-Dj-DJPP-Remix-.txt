Murder one on one, the hottest nigga under the sun
I come from under the tummy, bustin' a tommy
Or come from under your garments, yo chest and your arm hit
Pow, one to the head now you know he dead
Now you know I play it, like a pro in the game
Naw better yet a veteran a hall of fame
I got that medicine, I'm better than all the names
Ay it's Cash Money Records man a lawless gang

Put some water on the track, Fresh for all his frame
Wear a helmet when you bang it man and guard yo brain
'Cuz the flow is spasmatic what they call insane
That ain't even a muthafuckin' aim I get dough boy
And you already know that pimpin'
18 how I'm livin young'n show that Bentley
Stunna my Pa so you know that's in me
Gotti my mentor so don't go there wit me

Rush hour GT Bent' roof is absent
Ya bitch present wit the music blastin'
And she keep askin' how it shoot if it's plastic
I tell her you see if ya boy run up
She said back and cut the Carter back up, oh fa sho
Ay Big Mike they betta step thangs its already up
Before they step to a sergeant's son, I got army guns

You niggas never harmin' young
Fly wizzy my opponents done, I'm done talking
And I aint just begun
I been runnin' my city like Diddy ya chump
I fly by ya in a foreign whip
On the throttle wit a model bony bitch
Pair a phony tits, her hair is long and shit, to her thong and shit
Well here we go so hold on to this, uh lets go

Hold on, let me hit the blunt
So go, so go
This is the, this is the, this is the

This is the Carter

Birdman put them niggas in a trash can
Leave 'em outside of your door I'm your trash man
I'm steady lightin' another hash and ridin' in my jag
You will need a gas mask man
You snakes, stop hidin' in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it knock the blades in yo ass
You homo niggas getting AIDS in the ass
While the homie here tryna get paid in advance

I'm stayin' on my grizzy I'ma bonafide hustler
Play me or play wit me then I'm goin find your mother
Niggas wanna eat 'cuz they ain't ate nothin'
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone, leavin' out
Leavin' behind just residue and bones
In your residents with Rugers to your dome
Like where the fuck you holdin' the coke, holdin' your throat, choke

This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this
This is the Carter
