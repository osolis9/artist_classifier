Hey, hey, hey!
Because the cops is watchin', the streets is soakin'
Ya hoes is unfaithful, ya family ungreatful
Ya niggaz ain't loyal, ya niggaz ain't lawyers
And everybody saw you and ain't that a bitch!

And this here is the Carter, oh! Yo!
And this here is the Carter, yo! Oh!

This one here is just to clarify
The fact that I'm a muthafuckin' mack
This one here is just to verify the fact that
I got straps on my back
This one here is just to clarify the fact that
The boy is back! Oh!

Slick as I wanna be, born to be hustla, gonna be rich till I'm gone
Gonna keep spittin' this shit for the hustlaz
Gonna keep livin' this shit, I'm gutless
Bet I'm gonna reap this when I'm gone defeat this while I'm here
Gonna keep beatin' this street shit in ya ear
Gonna speak in every single street this year
My shit beat in every jeep on every street this year

Wizzle F Baby y'all niggaz can have the Weezy
I'm the Birdman Jr. junior
I'm a man to another man, to a bitch I'm a pimp
In the whip I'm a hundred grand
And in the streets, I'm a money man
And I'm a hunt it with the streets I get money in the streets
Like a hundred men
A hundred proof in my other hand
If ever fall spring back like a rubber band, know what I'm sayin'

The cops is watchin', the streets is talkin'

Ya niggaz ain't loyal, ya niggaz ain't lawyers
And everybody saw you and ain't that a bitch

Now all the bitches got me strollin' wit' my dick in my hand
And these niggaz got me rollin' with my clip on my hip
But this is my land so prick don't trip
'Cause K's don't jam and a nigga don't miss
They tellin' me I'm the shit like a nigga don't piss
But nigga don't slip 'cause I'll kill a punk bitch, word up!
And I don't affiliate with niggaz, I don't love neither bitches
Just money and drugs, nigga

Leave ya bitches, ya money and drugs, nigga
Three to ya wisdom five more to ya mug, nigga
How many more do ya love, nigga?
'Cause I got plenty more to give out
I ain't never been a mouthpiece
Ask ya reverend 'bout me, I'm the young god
Aim the shotgun at ya frame and bust boy
Brain and guts leak in the drain and such pour
Plain yuck at a fuck boy, fuck boy!

The cops is watchin', the streets is talkin'

Ya niggaz ain't loyal, ya niggaz ain't lawyers
And everybody saw you and ain't that a bitch

Or the tech meet ya ass, son, the tech heat ya ass, son
Put ya fuckin' chest beneath ya ass, son
Blooka blook blap bleep ya ass, son
Nigga tryin' to see his grandson and we got niggaz in the pen
Tryin' to see me wit' a Grammy
Wanna be me and don't even understand me
Couldn't see me even if you was standin' wit' me

I'm that damn convincing not invisible
That man's invincible
And advance a little due to the pine
My niggaz call me little Russell Crowe for my beautiful mind
And I let you do the time, I do the crime
When the crowd call my name I bring my crew to the line
Nigga that's S.Q. and we fine, nigga
That's S.Q. and we firin', nigga!
