[Hook: Future]
 I'm on that good kush and alcohol
 I got some down bitches I can call
 I don't know what I would do without y'all
 I'mma ball 'til the day I fall
 Ball, ball, ball, ball

 [Bridge:]
 Long as my bitches (yeah, yeah...)
 I could give a f-ck about no hater, long as my bitches love me
 (Yeah, yeah...)
 I could give a f-ck about no n-gga, long as my bitches love me

 [Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
 Pussy-ass n-ggas stop hatin'
 Lil' Tunechi got that fire
 And these hoes love me like Satan...
 F-ck with me and get bodied
 And all she eat is dick
 She on a strict diet
 That's my baby
 With no makeup she a ten
 And she the best with head
 Even better than Corinne
 She don't want money
 She want the time we could spend
 She said "cause I really need somebody,
 So tell me you're that somebody"
 And girl, I f-ck who I want
 And f-ck who I don't
 Got that A1 credit
 At that Filet Mignon
 She say "I never wanna you make you mad,
 I just wanna make you proud"
 I say "baby, just make me cum,
 Then don't make a sound"
 Tunechi...

 [Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
 Real n-ggas, f-ck these haters
 These hoes got pussies like craters
 Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man...
 Pussy, money, weed, codeine
 She say my dick feel like morphine
 I hope my name tastes like sardines to these n-ggas
 She wake up, eat this dick
 Call that breakfast in bed, 69.96
 I feel her heartbeat
 I chest to chest with this bitch
 Now turn around, face down, I'm arresting this bitch
 Yeah, all my bitches love me
 And I love all my bitches
 But it's like soon as I cum
 I come to my senses
 And I would say these hoes' names
 But then I would be snitchin'
 And these haters try to knock me
 But they can't knock me off the hinges
 Tunechi...

 And kiss my ass if you hatin'
 I'm getting' ass while I'm skatin'
