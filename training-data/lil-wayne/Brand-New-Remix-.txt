Ridin' round tha city wit some brand new heat
Brand new car, brand new feet
Brand new seats, brand new smell
Put out tha roach light a brand new L

Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new

I'm cold like a midnight in Aspen
I am tha president and tha assassin
Cameras on big lights, action
Welcome to the show, I am tha main attraction

Money in tha mattress, money in tha attic
Money on my mind, money is my habit
Stay on tha grind until money's automatic
Bitch, I love money, I'm a fuckin' fanatic

Always strapped, gripped tight graspin'
Say what? Who me? Click clack, blast 'em
Chrome 24s, tires thin like napkins
Gotta ride big 'cause I am like a captain

You know I'm a boss, chillin', relaxin'
Probably in my office doin' my taxes
You little niggas so not in my bracket
And I don't even have time to practice

Ridin' round tha city wit some brand new heat
Brand new car, brand new feet
Brand new seats, brand new smell
Put out tha roach light a brand new L

Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
(Brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new
(Brand new)

Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new
(Brand new)
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
(Brand new)

Ice, ridiculous price
Ya camera has never seen a picture this nice
I'm fishin' and tha bitches will bite
It's probably 'cause my game is Fixodent tight, right

I'm fuckin' every bad bitch twice
And if she doesn't wear panties then I fuck her on sight
I'm nasty like spice, I know what she likes
I could make a black women scream like she white

I can make a white woman scream like Mike
But before she start singin', she gotta check my mic
Niggas just hatin' and I done lost sight
It's like I don't see 'em, I only see tha light

Talkin' that shit but you boys just hype
I hope you bring ya gun to tha fight, aight
Louis V tennis shoes, big brown stripe
You think you fresh shit, nigga, I'm ripe

Ridin' round tha city wit some brand new heat
Brand new car, brand new feet
Brand new seats, brand new smell
Put out tha roach light a brand new L

Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
(Brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new
(Brand new)

Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new
(Them too)
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
(Okay)

Brand new coupe, drive it crazy than a motha
Sittin' low in tha seats wit tha burners sittin' under
Got my tank top top down, it probably ain't summa
But I ride like that 'cause I'm hotter then the others

Damn, it's no keepin' up with tha brother man
I could spell my name in burnt rubber
I'm gone, leave me alone, all tha doggys at supper
You could wash my plate and put it back in tha cupboard

Uh um, I'm so far ahead of them suckers
I'ma hafta start rappin' in numbers
I promise tha flows don't stop, they come rappin' like thunder
I bet you hide under your covers

Ridin' round tha city wit some brand new heat
Brand new car, brand new feet
Brand new seats, brand new smell
Put out tha roach light a brand new L

Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
(Brand new)
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new
(Brand new)

Fuck you bitch my shoes brand new
(Them too)
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
(Yah)
