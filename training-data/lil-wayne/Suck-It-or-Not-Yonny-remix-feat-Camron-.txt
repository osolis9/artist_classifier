[Chorus: Cam'Ron]
Ma, I been hugging the block
That's right! hustlin rocks
I know, I been pufffin alot
But a nigga wanna know
Babygirl, are you gonna suck it or not?

[Cam'Ron]
Huh? My dick hard as a motherfucker
You don't what?! tell that shit to another sucker
I ain't no sucker mama, come on fuck the drama
And kiss it down, lil pucker-rama
I'm so active, you being so drastic
Got something for ya face, fuck pro-activ
I'm a pro at this
Round the globe, atlas
But I need to know ma, are you gonna suck it or not?
Babygirl, I'm in love with the twat
Missionary, back shots, pop it off, rock it off
I tell you right now if my cock is soft
But I want head before and after, top it off
On ya knees, show you how to top a boss
Lick, suck, deep throat, stop, cough, hop on, hop off, lollipop off
I know it's white, but here come the hot sauce

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron]
Lookin light skinned, mami was tight slim
Fat ass, big tits, I noticed her nice chin
I approached her, slight grin, white Timbs number you can type in
Said she don't like men
I just laughed
Ma, if we link, we link
You don't like men? me neither, what a coincidink (what a coincidence)
Ms. Jiggy, Ms. Piggy, Pinky mink, pinky ring blingin'
Ma, are you gonna suck it or not?
I ain't the type to diss you, kinda like to hit you
That's the situation, bring wifey with you
Would you like a tissue? (Why?) You gon' need it
for the cum up in your nose babygirl cause you suckin my cock
Ain't a question now, it's a guarantee
They say I think I'm the shit, well apparently
But you won't hear words like "Marry me"
Only thing you gonna hear is, suck it or not

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
I get head in the strangest places
2 at the same time, call it +Changing Faces+
I tell a bitch "we ain't trading places"
Now stand back and catch my amazing graces (hehehah)
Taste it, savour it
Vanilla Ice Cream, she say "ooh, my favorite"
Do you know who you playin' wit? Wayne
Chillin' like a scarecrow, looking for some brain
Drivin' in the range or flying on a plane
Her head is crazy so she's insane
She know the game
Get in and get right
Every bitch in the industry wanna rock my mic
I'm hot like light
I'm tough like Ike
I don't fuck with dog hoes cause them hoes might bite
Yeah, and if she follows
In the back of my mind, I'm hoping she swallows

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
