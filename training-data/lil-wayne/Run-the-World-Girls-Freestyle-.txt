Verse 1:
Some of them men
Think they freak this like we do
But no they don't.

Make your cheque come at they neck.

Disrespect us, no they won't.
Boy, don't even try to touch me.
Boy, this beat is crazy!
This is how they made me.
Houston, Texas baby.
This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest.

Who would buy it for themselves and get more money later.

I think I need a barber(barber).

None of these b****** can fade me (fade me).

I'm so good with this

I remind you I'm so hood with this.

Boy I'm just playing.
Come here baby.

Endless power our love we can devour.
You'll do anything for me.
