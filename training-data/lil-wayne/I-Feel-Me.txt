I say
I got so much money man
I don't know what to do with it
I was thinkin' about gettin' some and lettin' you spend it

Hey, I do it way bigger than you did it
I'm sittin' on them Jordan's
Must be the shoes in'it
I get rude in'it
Crude really crew
When it rains it storms get in the pool silly
Who really want it with us
Homeboy, you trippin
You gon fall and bust your ass
I can rap fast but I like slower better
Why? cause bitch I'm on the four
We better fly with no feathers
And if you don't know good you gon know better

Yeah, I'm talkin young money army
Weezy aka I got enough money on me
Yeah and ya'll niggas phony
I got some bullets with ya'll pictures on them
Ya'll don't really want me
And I blast off on three

She make you leave
And you just do you
And she just do me
Told cha
