[Intro: ~Tupac~]
I'm a buy a Benz cause that's what niggas do*
I'm a smoke weed cause that's what niggas do
I'm a pack a gat cause that's what niggas do
I'm a get drunk cause that's what niggas do
You understand I'm not gonna change cause muthafuckers got money

[Chorus: (2x]
I'm a buy a Benz (I'm a buy a benz) cause that's what niggas do
I'm a smoke weed (I'm a smoke weed) cause that's what niggas do
I'm a pack a gat (I'm a pack a gat) cause that's what niggas do
You understand me you yo yo you understand me

[Verse: ~Lil Wayne~]
Uhhh, they wanna lock me up and throw away the key
I wanna pop em up and throw away the heat
I don't play and when I do I play for keeps
I'm from the jungle where the lion eat the sheep
Yeah bubba just came home from the penitentiary
When I see him I'm a put him in a Bentley
Young Carter what it is, what it isn't
D Porter my sign say gone fishing
I'm a wizard, pooof! my top missing
Let the sky in and tell the bitch kiss it
Sip pink Mo, I drink pimp C
Never put the cup down (never put the cup down)
Bitch I'm from uptown
I say uptown
My lifes a nasty bitch ask bus down
Ask what now
And an ass never differs
Lil Weezy is... dat nigga

[Repeat Chorus:] (2x)
