Yeah, we on cloud 20, that's high
(High, high)
Wheezy F baby and the squad followin' the boy

Lexus, Benz, I'mpala's wit' the top down, drivin' careless
Swurvin' through from left to right and I'm dress so supa tight
Baby girl, shake it like Beyonce
I dun' forgot about Beyonce blowing smoke up in da' air
Table dances by my chair, get something now

I'm hot from New Orleans, wheezy F Baby
Way above ballin', stay above y'all and
I got da A and da K if y'all want it
I'm making way for my homies

Bet not sleep, stay awake for the mornin'
It's young Carter come and get it order, oops, hotter
You six feet in the six, I'm snuffed in the Bentley
Ooh, shawty stop playin' wit' me, I'm da heart of the SQ mobbers

Mobbin' wit my black Madonna, get my back momma
Got that Mac persona, I'm a P.I.M.P., I'm the uncrowned K.I.N.G.
I'm from uptown never tempt me 'cuz it's life in the battle
I'll leave my desert empty oh, oh, bezzle yellow is pee, yeah
Ain't a fella hotter than me, ain't another better than me, ooh

Lexus, Benz, I'mpala's wit' the top down, drivin' careless
Swurvin' through from left to right and I'm dress so supa tight
Baby girl, shake it like Beyonce
I dun' forgot about Beyonce blowing smoke up in da' air
Table dances by my chair, get something now

Hole in the door fa' show ya boy rollin'
I'm cold wit' da flow no boast but y'all boring
Hole in my coast by myself never bowling
Throwing the squad up lettin' em know what whizzle

F toatin', floating, notice the stroke in my motion strollin'
Toe and a poe and a smoke got me loaded
Put a purple ocean in my soda, make potion
Pull a rover over by some hoes in Magnolias

Roll ya body like a snake slow for all my boya'z
Whistle hotter than ya hottest gat but so poised
Bodies flying in the air while I whip the Harley
I'm hardly seeing you playa you can't see me

I'm a gangsta I supposed to be on TV Really
And the rose gold bezzle show clearly
V where you at? You gotta feel me, Daddy

Lexus, Benz, I'mpala's wit' the top down, drivin' careless
Swurvin' through from left to right and I'm dress so supa tight
Baby girl, shake it like Beyonce
I dun' forgot about Beyonce blowing smoke up in da' air
Table dances by my chair, get something now

See, I look to my side and Lil gutta say peel ya
Weezy F get familiar, y'all boy's gonna get peculiar
I'ma's kii, kii, kill ya, I'ma kit kat dealer
I'ma Mabac wheeler, I'ma get them millions

Like a slick big William hater, Big Willy like I fuck's wit Jada
I ain't got nuttin' but ya ya man
Nuttin' but flavors man, nuttin' but wages man
Nuttin' but paper

I'ma fuck it and tape it and show all of my homies
Drop 20's on the rari, scratch off at parties
I'ma make yo hoe grab all her shorties up in the escalade suburban
Snatch off that laundry, I'ma make y'all boys back off the army

Put that hammer to your dome, now, come off that arm piece
And I like that chain, I'm feeling that hat
My papi's Ozzy Osbourne and I'm feeling like Jack
Gimmie dat

Lexus, Benz, I'mpala's wit' the top down drivin' careless
Swurvin' through from left to right and I'm dress so supa tight
Baby girl, shake it like Beyonce
I dun' forgot about Beyonce blowing smoke up in da' air
Table dances by my chair, get something now
