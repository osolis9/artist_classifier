Y’all know me, cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentleys Coupes
Got no need, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop
Right there in the floor
Y’all know me, cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentleys Coupes
Got no need, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop

Okay, swimming in Polo, sleeping in Jordan’s
I bought a cell phone and I don’t even much call it
New imports make her feel important
No bullshit, nigga no Ben Gordon
Get her information, take her on vacation
Give her dope dick, now she under the sedation
Wake her in the morning, breakfast where she slept at
Tell her go shopping, I can’t wait till she get back
Louis flip-flops and a pair of pink sweat pants
She wear that on my jet, I fuck her after jet lag
I take her to the Vet, cause she a bad bitch
You can’t be broke and happy so me I’m mad rich
I’m talking Young Money shit, she love the way I think
L’Oreal all over my bathroom sink
Betsy Johnson all over my bathroom counter
My pockets too deep, I fuck around and drown her
Weezy

Y’all know me, cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentleys Coupes
Got no need, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop
Right there in the floor

Okay, fucking on Versace, napping on Satin
I love to hit it backwards, call it pig Latin
I bought her ass a Mac, now we be iChatting
Nigga swag jacking, but I got my patent
Fre-fresh out the salon, I took her to Milan
I speak a little French, and hers is no better than mine
I pass her the blunt, she probly’ hit it one time
Catch us at the game sitting on the baseline
We can call a timeout, take a little time out
Pockets too deep, shawty you going have to climb out
Fabiana prom dress with your spine out
And I live on the beach, you can get that panty line out
She wants to own me and I ain’t trying to fight it
She said it’s her dick, she got it copyrighted
And I don’t pay for pussy because her pussy priceless
I go fishing in it, and I ain’t a Pisces
Uh, Gucci only to the grocery store
Stop playing bitch, we ballin’ like Okafor
Ha, and now we headed to the dealer
I’m going to cop my baby something with no ceilings ahhh

Y’all know me, cause all I do is
Ride around in Bentleys Coupes
Got no need, she got me
Buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop
