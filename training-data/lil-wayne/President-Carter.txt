God bless America
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter

President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as god as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pocket pissin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Told tools like mechanics, mechanism
Uh, Detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu

I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no mother fucker harder than (Carter)
I President Carter Pres President Carter

President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died

Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives

When shit get deep I'm never afraid to die
Let the money pile up and tell 'em buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell

Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses
I president carter Pres (Amen) President
President Carter Pres President Carter so now
President Carter instead of pledge
we pray President Carter
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Realitys a bitch and I'm a dance with her

140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth hahahaha
thank you thank you all
i am president carter
