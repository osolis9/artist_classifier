From New Orleans, guns bangin', homie
These lil' niggas is retarded, puttin' testimony over sanctimony
All these niggas tryna sank the homie
Bitches tryna put gangster on me
Feds tryna put sanctions on me, doctor tryna do maintenance on me
Guess that's why I take meds on 'em, poppin', sippin', goin' bed on 'em
New Ferrari, no head on it, nice new carpet, you bled on it

You run your mouth like a marathon, I just run out of them styrofoams
The CI that's givin' me testosterone, now she got her legs on my collarbone
All on my neck like a herringbone
I had to sit down with Bizzy Bone
I had to sit down with Tity Boi, and told him how I'ma just kill his song
It's not a remix, it's just me, my comeback and shit
I deserve out a brick, put it on the scale, it come back thirty six
It come back thirty six, and that's when we whip, we master the wrist
Then that's when it flip, then after it flip, that's when it flip
You know what it's like when the feeling gone, I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
I know what that's like when the ceiling gone
