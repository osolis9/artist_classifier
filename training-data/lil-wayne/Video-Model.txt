We be up all night, up all night, this is love
We be up all night, up all night, don't give a fuck
Got my hands up high, so high, in the club
All my girls turnt up, cups poured up
All the boys wanna touch, they can't get enough, this is love
Think I'm in love
Turn up, don't turn me down, just let my body go
I'm about to work right now, like in a video
I might make you twerk right now, like in a video
Like in a video Like in a, like in a, like in a video, video

(We gon' get on down now)
(She pop that, pop that) video model
She turnt up, sippin' right out of that bottle
She pop that, like a video model
She turnt up, so I hit it from the bottom
She twerk that, and I'm putting in dollars
She turnt up like a video model
She throwing that ass like a video model
Stay twerking that ass like a video model

We be up all night, up all night, this is love
We be up all night, up all night, don't give a fuck
Turn up, don't turn it down, just let my body go
I'm about to work right now, like in a video
I might make you twerk right now, like in a video
Like in a video Like in a, like in a, like in a video, video

Uhh, I run this bitch
Girl I let you run your mouth
She say 'but I don't run from that dick'
Alright, I go so hard, I put it down
I put it down I leave a dent
I am just tryna get my fucking mile, out of an inch
My ho a psycho-pathic, with a fashion habit
Shake that ass, bitch, shake that ass, bitch
You a video model?, Action
And cameras don't lie, you the truth
Christina Milian you the truth
So if you man screw up, you need a nigga like me I'll knock every screw loose
I'm just saying, I'm not playing

She turnt up like a video model (Turn up)
She turnt up, sippin' right out of that bottle (Tunechi)
She pop that, like a video model
(Yeah, got a couple screws loose)
(I Got a couple screws loose )
She turnt up, so I hit it from the bottom
She twerk that, and I'm putting in dollars
She turnt up like a video model
She throwing that ass like a video model
Stay twerking that ass like a video model
