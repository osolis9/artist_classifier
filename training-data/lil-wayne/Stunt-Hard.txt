(feat. Nutt Da Kid, Drake)

[Chorus: Drake & (Wayne)]
I did it all on my own, turned a check to a throne
I'm a king and that's why I stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things that they never would of known
If I didn't, stunt hard
And everynight is a premiere, if I ever dissapear best believe I'm coming back (yeah, I'm leanin)
Stunt hard
Got rich, went broke and got rich again (alright)
On the same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hard (ahem, ahem)

[Verse 1: Wayne]
If I don't do nothing I'm a stunt my ass off
Money sitting in the pocket bout to get a pass off
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take ya cast off
And I got them beach bitches like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm a acrobat, sweety I'm a stunt devil
You can't get on my level cause I am so unlevel
I'm a young rebel and I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles, I need a stunt double
Yea me, Drake, and Kidd and you know it's trouble
We got em drowning in the flow you see em blowing bubbles
I stick my laning ina free draws
I have her bouncing back like dominique doors
Yea but I ain't stuntin these hoes, I been pimpin since Hulk Hogan was in NWO
Yea I'm Wild, Drizzy tough and the Kid vicious
The three horsemen, we just need Sid Vicious
Yea I'm on a cup of that tilt
And if you hatin on me I say fuck ya like Will
Yea I'm a WILDerbeast, you just a wilderbeast
My two fingers make a gun and shoot and kill ya peice
Yea talking big big shit, I am rude I take food from a kid picnic nigga
Yea and we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit cause I write all stunner bars haha

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own, turned a check to a throne
I'm a king and that's why I stunt hard (Young Money)
I put my whole city on to some things that they never would of known (King weezy f)
If I didn't, stunt hard (Drake)
And everynight is a premiere, if I ever dissapear best believe I'm coming back (I see ya nigga)
Stunt hard (stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke and got rich again (Ugh)
On the same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hard
