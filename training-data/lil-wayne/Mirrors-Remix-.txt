YMCMB, Double M G
We rich forever
Maybach Music!

Walkin through the crib you can hear the waterfalls
Like the projects out in Philly bumpin "Im a boss"
If im feelin shorty you know ima floss
Did my thing in the summer my money summersault
Now im at the dealer with the worst credit
Got a yellow carat now I smoke lettuce
Let her count my bread she a bank teller
Can you keep a secret Im a rich nigga?
Got the new ghost in the drop 2
Thats 800 racks when I stop through
Dealin with the same team talkin wade back
Now I deal with big cream theme maybach
Shes a thoroughbred, so her bags new
Welcome to the fam that's a 100 rack move
All in a duffel baby you could call it yours
Countin all day now I call it chores
You inherit real estate when you stay in line
Can you imagine even livin in my state of mind?
Strawberry swisher sweets with my a\Aston ..
Bumpin slim dunkin tryin to live this life of mine

I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself I'm lookin' at the

Lil Wayne- I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your windowpane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne I'm looking at the

Lil Wayne- Looking at me now, I can see my past Damn
I look just like my fuckin' Dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my Mama's smile, that's a blessing I see the change;
I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the
