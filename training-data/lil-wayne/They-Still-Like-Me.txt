Niggas say they hot but its really not seemin.
If these guys bad then I gotta be a demon
Waynes getting money like Damon and Kenan

Bangin and leaving
Stains on the cement
Slide the cracker something so they tame the police man
Left in a Porsche came in a Karnish
And I'm fresh yeah the Gucci sweats came with the creases

Trying to put some cheese on my pieces
If your lookin for ya nigga

Huggin on that money tryin to put it in a sleeper

Leave your whole head empty like a strained pumpkin

Name still buzzin even when I'm doin nothing,
But im never doing nothing

Just a young ass nigga
With some old ass bread

And my nigga (tas pope)? been ridin wit me since pegs
And my right wrist is lookin like a cracked open egg
That's white and yellow diamonds
Adjust your lighting
