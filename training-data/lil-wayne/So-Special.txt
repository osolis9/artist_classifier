So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special
So special, you're so special

Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader

I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, rat-a-tat her

I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said, "Thank you"
I said, "You're very welcome," I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana

Baby, won't you spend the night
Darling, I don't want to wake up and you are not by my side
(So special, you're so special)
(So special, you're so special)

And if you promise me tonight, girl
Baby, that you'll let me in then I'ma make you feel so special, girl
(So special, you're so special)
(So special, you're so special)

Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off I'ma run it back
And then she say my name like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt

Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep

Baby, won't you spend the night
Darling, I don't want to wake up and you are not by my side
(So special, you're so special)
(So special, you're so special)

And if you promise me tonight, yeah
Baby, that you'll let me in, then I'ma make you feel so special, girl
(So special, you're so special)
(So special, you're so special)

Yeah, thinking 'bout you girl, got my mind on E
You know them other niggas, they ain't me
Girl, I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya

I put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse

See we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now she's on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
'Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz, buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug

Baby, won't you spend the night
Darling, I don't want to wake up and you are not by my side

And if you promise me tonight, yeah
Baby, that you'll let me in then I'ma make you feel so special, girl
(So special, you're so special)
(So special, you're so special to me)
