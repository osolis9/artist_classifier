A shorty,
A shorty,
Yea,
I'mma New Orleans gangsta after tha storm,
boy it took 'bout 3 million to rebuild ma home,
but I'm back on defense, back in ma zone,
I eat rapper and go in my yard and bury they bones,
huh, my pockets on Raven Symone that's FAT,
what you know 'bout huh? See I'mma keep it goin',
keep it movin', we can do it, I ain't trippin',
so far ahead of them niggas we got a time difference,
don't confuse me with them, I'm different,
tryna holla at T.I.P. For a movie audition,
I push that Mazerati to tha limit zig-zaggin'
though that traffic like Emmitt,
I tell them niggas hurry and buy,
and if you try and snitch you get buried alive yea,
and I don't chase em' like you do
I keep a bad bitch skatin' like Nu-Nu
