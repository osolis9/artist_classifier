Damn she bad, damn she thick
And I may not know perfect but damn she eat
And she thick and she right, damn she nice
You can be my judge, baby, yeah, I'll do life, gimme life

And I know that you'll be dancing 'til your toes hurt
But I can make your toes curl, I can make your soul jerk
We can soul search and I also got that street credit
I got more work than any dude you knew
Girl, I am a blood su wu

I hear you want somebody you can call, Boo
I will change my name to Boo and fuck around
And call you, now what you wanna do?

Because whatever that maybe, baby, I want do that too
And oh, I will G P S you, now what you're going through?
And like a pair of wet n' sticky vickies, girl, I'm on you

Okay, ma the mood is so right
Light to and take flight
My nigga T I. is the king, I am your prince, you're knight
You don't need a superman, you just need a man like Weezy

Baby

And I can make you feel the same way
We can postpone and stay home like a rain day
She'll have the salad, just put her on Wayne's plate
What you know 'bout having syrup poured on that pancake?

Nasty as I wanna be or nasty as you like me too be
I hope you like me too but now you know I like you too
3 a.m, room service, serve you

You can be my dessert, my caramel sherbet
Call your mama, we can make a baby
And the way you work that mic in your video is so

Crazy

And the chair or stool move was cool
You make me wanna, oh
But I'm be cool
I need a moment

I think you are the finest human on earth
We can get together, I can help you with that homework
Take your ass to school too, Boo
Teach you all the rules you never knew
We need a moment

I can be your future, I can be your teacher
Be your professor, write down this lecture
You want some extra credit? Lemme check your homework
I can be your tutor and help you with exams

No feelings? Or it's summer time for you
You got them goodies and I got a sweet tooth
Now can you all blame me?
Shit,  hov got B and I just want C

See, I just want to see if you're taller than me
Naw, really, I just wanna see if you are Mrs. Carter, to be
Yeah, I know this is pretty awkward for me
But I just act like you are talking to me when you say

Oh, I mean everything that I say
From the bottom of my heart
I would never, never, ever hurt you
I open my heart, open my heart

Believe that and I agree that
Open up your heart to me and you won't get your key back
Miss Ciara, you are colder than blue
And baby, I ain't talking to nobody else but

You, there's nothing I won't do, baby.
To spend my life with you
I give my life to you
I promise that I will never lie, oh

Ay, sweetheart, I don't care what nobody say
Real niggas gonna show respect, ya dig
Ay, darling, you are all that, whatever that is
I'd sure like to know, ha ha
Let me cut that out but straight up, mama
I just did this, ma because you deserve it, I'm out
