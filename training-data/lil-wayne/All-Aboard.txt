Hey...Escucha las palabras de Romeo
You need this in your life (yeah) ven aqui

[Romeo Santos]
I ain't gonna give you instructions
You just gotta follow my lead
Your body's making sounds like percussion
I'm orchestrating your fantasies

[Chorus]
And when you wake up feeling like a dream
You ain't gon' believe it...
And everything u need...
Girl you're gonna receive it tonight
And I know your condition
I'ma make you feel alive
Relax and feel the ride

So act like it's the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left
And girl it's for you baby
The last ride, girl you wont
Find this feeling nowhere
You better hurry 'cause the train is leaving

All aboard

Come on...montate mami
I ain't using words as persuasion
I don't got a reason to speak
It's always a special vacation
Every time you're laying with me

[Chorus:]
And when you wake up feeling like a dream
You ain't gon' believe it...
And everything u need...
Girl you're gonna receive it tonight
And I know your condition
I'ma make you feel alive
Relax and feel the ride

So act like it's the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left
And girl it's for you baby
The last grind, girl you wont
Find this feeling nowhere
You better hurry cause the train is leaving

All aboard

[Lil Wayne]
She want to ride that wayne train
So I'ma bag her like baggage claim
We smoke that mary not plain jane
And everything is just fine
I keep a picture of her smile
In the back of my mind
I grab the back of her head
She throw it back like rewind

I put her face in the pillow
Taste it a little
Shorty said she feels like
She sitting on a missile

I say 5, 4, 3, 2
The 1 can only be you
Shorty said oh lord I'm coming
I say me too
My love has no equal,
Get on top
And if you ride this train
Get off at your stop

This is the last time
The last chance for you to go there
There's one ticket left
And girl it's for you baby
The last ride girl you wont find this feeling nowhere
You better hurry 'cause the train is leaving
