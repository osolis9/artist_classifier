Uh, with everything happenin' today
You don't know whether you're comin' or goin'
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it

Whoo, look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You lookin' at me but I'm lookin' through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise

I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm lookin' at the

Mirror on the wall
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend

You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we, here
Talkin' to each other again?

Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong

I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the

Mirror on the wall
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
(My only friend)

You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
(They can't understand)
So why are we, here
(Misunderstood)
Talkin' to each other again?

Lookin' at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fuckin' dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror

I see my momma smile, that's a blessin'
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could've been any clearer
So I'm startin' with the man in the

Mirror on the wall
(MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
(Take 'em to Mars, man)

You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talkin' to each other again?

Mirror on the wall
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
(Any questions?)

You told me that they can
(I come to you)
Understand the man I am
(You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talkin' to each other again?

Mirror on the wall
Ay BP
Looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time
So why are we talkin' to each other again?
