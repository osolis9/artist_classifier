Cut the music up, please

Yeah, I should never leave hip-hop
Controlled by my two hands, they go tik-tok
Around the clock, yes, it's my time, my throne
Better know the time of day in any fuckin' time zone

I'm feeling like I'm on top of the rhinestone
Pullin' the ladder from heaven, about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than the pinecone
In this world of numbers, I keep my nine on

And I don't go to church because they lying low
And the preacher, he be gettin' his shine on
But I know my Lord, I am God's own
Banks on my hands, tick tick, a time bomb

Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
I'll be here 'cause I won't quit, yeah

You can try to lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now 'cause that ain't me

You can try to lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now 'cause that ain't me

Try to stay afloat on my inner tube
When they turn my city into a swimming pool
Before that, it was a living cesspool
We got get on our shit like nats do

Police's be on my tip like hats do
But I just stay strong like blacks do
Never saved by the bell in a black school
And I stay in trouble like Zack do

And in this game nobody's on my plateau
Therefore my name remains like a tattoo
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots
B-I-R-D man junior or Weezy F Baby

Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
I'll be here 'cause I won't quit, yeah

You can try to lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now 'cause that ain't me

You can try to lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now 'cause that ain't me

(That ain't me)
You see, I won't stop
(That ain't me)
Ooh, I won't quit
(That ain't me)

No, I won't stop
(That ain't me)
'Cause that ain't me

Alright, alright, alright, alright
I'm in their conversations
The titles up for grabs, I'm into confiscation
Punch, shot or stab now you're the doctors patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation

I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hating
And these niggas ain't shit like they constipating
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light, that's when I be heading

So far ahead of them, I feel outdated
But I feel electric like I'm Raiden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I'm coming out with faders, no homo

Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
Yeah, don't you know I'll be, I'll be
I'll be here 'cause I won't quit, yeah

You can try to lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now 'cause that ain't me

You can try to lock me up
You can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now 'cause that ain't me

(That ain't me)
You see, I won't stop
(That ain't me)
Oh no, I can't stop
(That ain't me)

'Cause I won't quit, no, I won't quit
  (That ain't me)
No, that ain't me
