No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down

Undisputed, Tunechi

Let's talk some sports, baby
I know my sports, baby
From the field arena
Octagon to the court, baby
The new kids on the block
Over here at Fox
Dominating the debate
Now they take a second take, uhh
Hold up, wait, it's time to skip all the other stuff
It's time to sharpen the sharp that's why he cutting up
You don't know Skip Bayless
Rock, you been under one
Eyes don't lie, just hope you see where I'm coming from
Numbers don't lie, this a Fox Sports One on One

No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down

No
Let's go face to face, I embrace debate
I don't make mistakes, I just make my case
Drops mic when I'm done, what more can I say?
I bite to my tongue, I don't like the taste
I'm on in the morning, I own my opponents
I'm always in the zone, need to zone out to zone in
And we could get it popping, pick the topic if you want it
Skip and Shannon, skip that hopping
Took these fours and made a posse, alright
You are kidding me, woah

No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down

No feelings, relentless
Feelings, relentless
Feelings, relentless
Feelings, relentless

No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down
No mercy, no mercy, no mercy
And I won't back down

No feelings, relentless
