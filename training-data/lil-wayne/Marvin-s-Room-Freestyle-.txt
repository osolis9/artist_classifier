Dana texted me and say she wanna see me
Than sent a picture of her in the mirror
No clothes on, of course
And she want that dope dick
Hello, world, I'm the dope dealer
I love it when she talk crazy
That dick make her walk crazy
That last time was awesome
All the lines we crossed them
I ain't a killer but don't push me.
I OJ Simpsoned that pussy
That's the shit, pussy taste so good
Make you smack your lips.
I don't know bbout you, but I'm a beast with mine
She said she wait for the Carter 69
I told her "Sorry 4 The Wait"
I value her time like an Audemars-Piguet
And we gonna stay
