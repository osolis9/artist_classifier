Yeah, hit me wit the snares Fresh
Just the snares Fresh, I like the snares Fresh
I'ma ride the snares all the way
Throught this thing right here man
I'm sexy Weezy baby
Test once again' what up
This is what they call me bitch

Eagle Eagle Carter Man
In a 96 Regal contraband
On my way to the east to the laundromat
Gotta wash that money and get on my ass

Gotta flip them bricks it be gone so fast
I gotta do somethin' I done blown my last
Dollar holla at ya boy on the ave
And that cheaper eagle is what I'm known to have

Shit tend to be slow I put on the mask
And make it halloween and take all ya bags
I say Holly Holly Grove wount you gon on and stash
Fuck it make these mutha fuckas understand

I say look coach ya pitchin' at me underhand
But I'm a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Y'all been designin' woman I'm a womans man
I'm the Cash Money prince blow the trumpets band and

They say they want the drugs to stop
But I'ma major set back when my album drop
I got that wet crack flow out ya mammy's pot
I got that jet black 4 at ya mammy's spot

I'm tryna get back door I demand it now
Yeah, panic now you better pan it down
Fore the neighbors sen me over here tearin' it down
Here's Weezy F. Baby and his crown, The Prince

This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

And the handgun is so included
Don't get it confused I want no confusion
And keep ya hoe I don't want yo contusions
I make my hoe stop and let the dough keep movin'

A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
It's money over bitches that I'm gon keep provin'
Yes it's Weezy F. I got ya mama groovin'
Out of all the Hot Boys she say I'm the coolest

I bought my bag of oranges this time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm tryna seduce it
I floss a awful lot of haters tryna reduce it
But the laser on the 45 is eyein' ya stupid, oh

One shot to remind ya who is
That fly lil nigga thats behind the trigga, wizzle
I'm off chronic combined wit liquor
But nigga will never see me like mama tigger, oh

A 80's baby a fightin' nigga
I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I'm somethin' ya culpepper like a Viking slick
See me over the Viking stove and I'm whitin' bricks

Or in the middle of the shootout untightin' clips
Pop another one shoot back while lightin' this spliff
I do this, you catchin' my drift
Representin' wit my section on my belly and shit, I am the prince

This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own
Let's get it on

So roll the carpet out
'Cause you fuckin' wit a nigga from the royal south
See ya either in or ya out
And if ya out stay in 'cause them warriors out

Them vultures the cops and them lawyers out
I just open up the gate and let my hoyas out
Nah, nigga I never call ya house
I'm probably somewhere takin' Toya out

Not answerin' my phone man ignorin' ya spouse
She leavin' messages about me enjoyin' her mouth, aye, stop
I'm ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name nah better yet point em out, aye

Me and the streets got a joint account
I'm from the streets that ya need to be warned about
New Orleans woadie put the gat in ya mouth
And we tote a lot of iron that'll flatten ya out

Few roaches but never have no rats in his house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler move my packagin' out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out

These niggas talkin' sweet I get them cavities out
I got graveyard flyers man I'm passin' em out, aye
Bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground
And bow down to ya majesty now I am the Prince

This is my town my home, yeah
This is my crown my throne
(The prince)
This is me on my own
(The prince)
Let's get it on
(The prince)

This is my town my home
(The prince)
This is my crown my throne
(Weezy)
This is me on my own
(By my self so niggas guess what)
Let's get it on
