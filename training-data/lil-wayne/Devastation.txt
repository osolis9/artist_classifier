Bitch,
(Hook)
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga

(Verse)
I got the 2-2-3 cocked, I point it at yo melon
Loose lips ain’t ships so ain’t no motherfuckin tellin
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
Gas up the minivan, put the pumps in the trunk
Now I be sippin on something, they got me tilted to the side
All black ski mask red chinese eyes
Now I’ve been home for years, I’mma take yo plate
I’ma eat yo steak dead in yo face
I woke up on a mission, I got 2 women I ride with
One named Nina and that yapper my side bitch
We sign niggas up so wisely choose who side with
Got something on my side, that pack of kick – that’s my sidekick
I’m about that paper, roll the dice and get paid
And they can’t bite the hand I’m feeding with, I’m holding grenades
So I’mma talk my shit, I’mma live my life
I’mma nail yo girl, shit I did that twice
Gudda!

(Hook)
I’m a east side nigga
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown

(Verse)
Money don’t make itself
These niggas gonna make me kill em
I should probably see it shrink but I’m afraid he’ll make me little
I’ve been a beast since I could remember
I got too many hoes, that’s my dilemma
Chop yo fuckin head off and put it on the front of my car like the emblem
Get em liite banger on the beat, I got this banger on display

I just test-drove a new Lamborghini and got a A
Got a billion bitches, I’m lookin for the one that got away
And since all these niggas watchin, have some fun the time of day
Fuck yall niggas I’m skatin
Got yo hoe at the skate park waitin
That dick keep on comin back, motherfucker reincarnation
I don’t want that pussy this spatious
Just give me fellatio
My bitch named Gigi give me head, I be like goodness gracious, fuck
Hi, my name is Tune, it’s nice to eat ya
I still keep that gun like a secret
Another one bites the dust, would you like to eat it
Boy I have the people lookin for you like a reason uh
Get over here with my blunt cuz I’m been eat the pussy all day
This gun got a head trigger, I pull this bitch til it’s ball here
Ye ain’t got no bars nigga
Recharge, you gona dead
Can’t kill me, I was born dead
Crowned of thorns head
Devil horns red, have my barn head
I’m a serial killer, yo lucky charm dead
And that trash bag, they find yo arm leg leg leg arm head
Oh what a tangle where we we bout feel like daddy long legs
I bought that Ferrari Spider from my boys at Rykers in all my lifers
My bitch say my niggas great
But I make er say it like Tony the Tiger
I own a riffle and I’m on the edge
I pop pop and I’m ridin off
I’m devastation, I’m Freddy Jason, Dedication 5, 5 stars
Tunechi "What up 5"
