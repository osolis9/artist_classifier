[Intro:]
I Wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you cant see my eyes unless my head is bent

[Lil Wayne:]
We stay high on that 5 0 4 shit (New Orleans)
Some day I all the time and you know this
We stay high on that 5 0 4 shit (New Orleans)
Some day I all the time and you know this

[Verse 1:]
Look straight out of the garage on a hog and you know i redo the insides like the morgue (x3)
The coup blue like that dude on mars
Ridin with the bitch prettier than the da barge
Mommy want a soldier baby im a sarge if you cant have me but cant have a menarge
Now rub me wrong and fuck up my massage and these flowers for the dead better get them a cizarge
Yea, head nigga enlarge and every thing i do i San Deigo charge
While you niggas just starve, im eating so much imma fuck around and barf
And red is the color of my scarf, and understand to a giant your a dwarf
My flows goin off, im so sick all i gotta do is cough

[Chorus:]
We stay high on that 5 0 4 shit (New Orleans)
Some day I all the time and you know this
We stay high on that 5 0 4 shit (New Orleans)
Some day I all the time and you know this

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
I got a thing for them big trucks, big fine bitches with good jug and big butts
5'4" mommies with nice head and fake tits
That dont get loose off goose and proly act up
5'7" bitches with bow legs that take dick
All they really need is 2 pills and 6 blunts
Wake up in the morning, and count money, and make grits, she dont really know no English so we dont say shit
Chea, Wayne said let it rain on em, mother nature with the paper doin the mack maine on them
Yeah, like their one thousand like whoosh, like there go two thousand, BALLIN
Now shake that ass like you came, pay your cable bill and your tryin to watch the saints on your sixty inch hitachi, livin like Liberachi, sportin the latest versace, shotty and mazaradi, dodgin the paparazzi, A.C. Cole like the heart of nazis, this years classic like old school herachees, you get your grill cooked like it was hibachi, word the cousin rod need us
