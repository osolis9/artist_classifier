[David Banner]
Hello itâ€™s Mr. David Banner, your bitch eater
I suggest that you donâ€™t kiss or hug her and donâ€™t eat her
I Run DMCâ€™s in this bitch in my adidas
I was chose to expose when you chose as a leader
Yes Iâ€™m fresh like a rose picked from the garden of Eden
Iâ€™m stepped out the rose my game rose like Easter
I got a couple bitches thatâ€™s painted like Mona Lisa
Now I fuck â€˜em at my leisure and i never touch my visa
so ghetto, my kicks so retro, got nuts like a rhino, call them Mark Echo
You know I ainâ€™t bragginâ€™, Iâ€™m just sayinâ€™
I know yâ€™all said it too, cuz yâ€™all niggas playinâ€™
Bitch

[Chorus]
And bitch Iâ€™m tall as Yao Ming
And bitch Iâ€™m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)

[2 Chainz]
Lets make a toast to the breadwinner
I am so damn hot on the scale winter
Life a bitch, Iâ€™ll dance with her
All up in the sand with her
Try to get up in the bed with her
And put my third leg in her
Oh Iâ€™ve been pumpinâ€™ pussy like gas, nigga
Got my foâ€™foâ€™, youâ€™ll get 8 like math nigga
Still use a shoe box for my stash nigga
Money so tall you gone need a drug round with ya
self esteem high like 26
You can catch me gettin high with like 20 bitches
Takeinâ€™ plenty pictures, yea you know Iâ€™m camera ready
Iâ€™m about to wax that ass I got my camera ready

[Chorus]
Look at my daddy (x4)
and bitch Iâ€™m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
and bitch Iâ€™m tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy (x4)

[Lil Wayne]
Ok, traffic on Mars, smokin in a spaceship
Bright red flag stickin out like fake lips
Iâ€™m forever young, forever Young Mula
Bitch, cash money is an army, oorah
Tunechi be what they call me
Iâ€™m everything but sorry
Get a bad ass high yellow bitch to come and ride my horse
I named it Charlie
No cream in my coffee, donâ€™t bleed on my carpet
I falls in love with all these hoes, but its money over bitches regardless
Iâ€™m so high I wonâ€™t come down, boy my pack be dumb loud
Waiting for one of these niggas to cross the line, like a touchdown
I gotchu, Iâ€™m Piru, bitch Iâ€™m out there by you
Blade on the AK, cut your ass like high school
David banner on the beat, bitch, dig it like a deep ditch
I got the world in my hands Iâ€™m about to make a fist
Ha, I stand tall as Yao Ming!!
blocka pow pow pingâ€¦ must be New Orleans!!

[Chorus]
