O-okay, I got this chrome on this Buggati, I'm strong in this Buggati,
Two V8's, ain't no such thing as driving calm in this Buggati
Bitch, I'm bad, I'm worse, I'll pass the purp
Don't fuck with me 'cause right now I'm higher than Captain Kirk

I swear I be the sickest nigga, you can ask the nurse
And if you throw it in the bag, I bet I'll snatch her purse
Ok I spazz, I curse, you last, I'm first
I'm on your ass like dirt, behind that cash, get merked

I'm talkin' big shit nigga, join my hit list nigga
What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga, hold court in the streets
And convict this nigga, oh, dickless nigga

Man, I'm runnin' with the Blucka, Young Money, motherfucker
You bet we gonna do our thing, well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the comers and whoever among us
And you know I'mma bust my ass until my crew very humongous

I said T.I. hold ya head, and Mack, hold ya head
Wish I could, but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, Cold Red, man, you know how we plead
And if it cost to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay

I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip, now it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promise tomorrow
Now when they kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra

Few rollin' killer plants, lil' tune shop of horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make them look like Toccora
Man, I'm too much for these niggas, and three much for these hos
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed

I love my baby mommas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I love motor island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard

Quarterback shotgun, you don't get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breakin' all the backboards
Pretty boy floored, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House we pull up at the back doors

Walk around like I'm thirty feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hos tryin' to birdy these balls
And the Porche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chillin', I'm cool like Lou Rawls

Young money in the building, I'm puttin' up new walls
Nigga, take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbin' two logs
Young Moola, we the new shit and new drawers

Now get off my dick, I ain't fucking with ya
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Red bone do me good, then her friend, her sister

I mean her bitch, she never met her best friend, her sister
I leave her pussy Microsoft like Windows Vista
Young Tuche, pop that cucci for a goon hoe
Bullet in you boys memory, now you act like you don't know

Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out, but couldn't fuck with Holly Grove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But heaven or hell, I hope in that debut where I'mma go

Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still long hair, don't care, like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smashed this verse, and I swag and surf
No ceilings
