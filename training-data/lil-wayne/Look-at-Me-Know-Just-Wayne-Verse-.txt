Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how yâ€™all doinâ€™?
Iâ€™m Lil Tunechi, Iâ€™m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the 3 stooges
I donâ€™t eat sushi, Iâ€™m the shit, no Iâ€™m pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ainâ€™t eatinâ€™, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot â€˜em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then Iâ€™m like olay
I donâ€™t care what you say, so donâ€™t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
Thatâ€™s word to my flag, and my flag red
Iâ€™m out of my head, bitch Iâ€™m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ainâ€™t hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and Iâ€™m not even trying
Whats poppinâ€™ Slime? nothinâ€™ five, and if they trippinâ€™ fuck â€˜em five
I ainâ€™t got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and sprite on a private flight, bitch Iâ€™m enticing
Guiding light, and my pockets white, and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddyâ€™s dead
You faggots scared cause Iâ€™m too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
Iâ€™m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now bitch

Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, Iâ€™m getting paper...
