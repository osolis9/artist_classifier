Look, beat the beat up till the beat get punch drunk
Drown in my flow, muthafucka, bring ya swimmin' trunks
Everybody say they just do it, well, I just don't
Times do change, muthafucka, but the gun don't

Woke up this mornin' with my dick to the ceilin'
Fell asleep with another chick from my buildin'
Kick her ass out and have breakfast like a mu'fucka
I'm with another bitch by supper

Yeah, me and hate, that's an odd couple
You niggas fake, you wouldn't pop bubbles
You can act stupid, bitch, I'm dumber
And T Barker is my muthafuckin' drummer, let's go

I'm fallin' down a landslide on a one way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride, well, let's see what you can do
And it feels like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and I know just what to do
'Cause I'm fallin' down a landslide on a one way trip to you

I been doin' this shit
And you know what they say about the shoe if it fit
Have a ball till I fall though
And if I die today I bet the world end tomorrow

It's fucked up how you ain't never me
And I got blind money, money you will never see
And only in the mirror's where you'll find a better me
I make money and my fingers make the letter B

I'm very sick, very sicker than you
And when I play sick I'm Jordan with the flu
Yeah, then I become a muthafucka
And my nigga, Travis Barker, is my drummer, muthafucka, let's go

I'm fallin' down a landslide on a one way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride, well, let's see what you can do
And it feels like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and I know just what to do
'Cause I'm fallin' down a landslide on a one way trip to you

I get better with time and time is forever
So just sit back and watch my time get better
So check your watch, I'm strong as scotch
Poppa was a rollin' stone, I was born to rock

Tell it like it is, shit, I don't know when it isn't
To be or not to be, shit, I don't know my decision
I don't know how I made it for this long in this condition
'Cause my flow so sick I shoulda died in the first verse

Mr. Doctor Carter with my hand up a nurse skirt
Suck me like soup and I'mma eat you like Surf and Turf
Just let me know when you are comin'
And my muthafuckin' nigga, T Barker, keep drummin', let's go

I'm fallin' down a landslide on a one way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride, well, let's see what you can do
And it feels like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and I know just what to do
'Cause I'm fallin' down a landslide on a one way trip to you
On a one way trip to you, one way trip to you
