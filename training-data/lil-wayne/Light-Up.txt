Haters temporary
Love is necessary
I went from eating p-ssy to eating commissary

Damn… I need therapy
You can buy the answers but you can’t afford to question me
First off I don’t need you second guessin’ me
Jail is like third base I’m comin’ home eventually
Still got shooters like hot tubs man im anemic, still got blood

I’m in my cell readin’ fan mail
Wish I was in Amsterdam sippin’ Amstel
Thinkin’ ’bout all of that pussy I can’t smell
Man they did me wrong I feel like Nelson Mandel’
I shine too hard my lamp fell

My name still ringin’: Alexander Graham Bell
I know you met damn ’cause you know Damn Well
That I still got you open open like a clam shell
Yeah, still fly on my hawk shit
My conversation stinks ’cause I talk shit
Stay in your lane you’re on that double talk shit
We eatin’ at the top get a spoon and a forklift
I got rap wrapped up like a gift
I’d be sober if gift was a fifth
I’m feelin’ like Elvis–jailhouse rock
I’m not Tupac I’m the New Pac
Behind bars but the bars don’t stop recordin’ over the phone
I hope the call don’t drop
Drizzy got the ball and I know the ball won’t drop

And I pray none of my kids never wanna be cops
Young Money get ‘em, Young Money got ‘em
The boss got his feet up, vacation on an island
Yeah and tell your girls send the kite up
And even if you don’t smoke motherfucker you gon’ have to light up
