You're going to love me, baby

Fresh checkerboard Vans and a t-shirt
And it's going down but she first
My flow sweet, make my teeth hurt
I spit ice cream bars, that's dessert

To me there's no such thing as a G-1st
Ya, my feature price high like a mink purse
I smoke a whole reef of the reefer
Drugs are bad but I beg to defer, sir

I just take a look at her face
So she can see that
My shades are Versace and she purr
'Cause I'm a cool cat per say

So I give her my life and now I got 8 word
She asked me to go over her place, I said sure
She said shes been horny all day, I got the cure
I'm on her like turf
Now bring that ass, bring that ass
Bring that ass hurr, ya digg?

I, I, I don't know that you been told
But I can tell you something 'bout me
I smoke weed, I drink and I roll

Now is you fucking with me
Now I can't tell shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothing on me
'Cause after a pill and half and a shot of PatrÃ³n
I'm a pussy M.V.P.
