Out of sight, out of mind,
 Out of time, to decided.
 Do we run?
 Should I hide?
 For the rest, of my life.

[Verse 1:]
 Dear Anne
 My number 1 fan
 I write with the light from the lamp on my nightstand
 With my pen in my right hand
 And that's also my mic hand
 Codeine in the sprite can
 Ink on the white pad
 And I'm thinking of life, Anne
 And wrong and right, Anne
 And sometimes I'm right
 And sometimes I might
 Ca-can I find the light?
 Still my rhymes are bright
 So I continue my plan
 And I'm sure (shore) like white sand
 That they'll be price payin'
 Before my flight land
 But still, I want to see more than my sight can
 Adore, so I can't ignore
 What I want anymore
 So I just go, you can call me the Gore
 And oh yeah
 I got a girl, she act like I owe her
 And um, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
 And yeh, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
 But I really hope I'm not starting to bore

[Chorus:]
 Out of sight, out of mind,
 Out of time, to decided.
 Do we run?
 Should I hide?
 For the rest, of my life.

[Verse 2:]
 Dear Anne
 My number 1 fan
 I write you this letter
 I hope everything's grand
 I hope everyone's good
 I hope everybody's praying
 I hope â€“ hold up baby, let me switch hands
 See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit and
 It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
 And every time I look there's a problem with this man
 But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
 But your support held me up like kickstands
 And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
 And I'm tryna stay up out them chick's pants
[Laughs] but, I just can't
 But, on another note, this ain't just another note
 This is more than a rap
 This is more of an oath
 And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
 And I'm just hoping that you read this far

[Chorus:]
 Out of sight, out of mind,
 Out of time, to decided.
 Do we run?
 Should I hide?
 For the rest, of my life.

[Verse 3:]
 Dear Anne
 My number 1 fan
 By now you probably think I'm portraying who I'm sayin
 And sometimes I wish I wasn't him, but I am
 And it's people like you that make me part of what I am
 But hey, you are the shit
 Damn, pardon the gram (grammar)
 But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
 And shit, when my life be like some sort of exam
 It's a jungle out there- lions, horses and rams
 Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to began
 I just think of you, then I'm rewarded again
 And, with you, is where my artistry can
 And, so with you is where a part of me stands
 And, I hope I see you in the stands
 Anne, because you know I understand
 And, and I'm sorry about Stan
 So I wrote this to say I'm your number 1 fan.

[Chorus:]
 Out of sight, out of mind,
 Out of time, to decided.
 Do we run?
 Should I hide?
 For the rest, of my life.
