Then we get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position
And that's when you change position, shit

But you got famous and shit

And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click
And I ain't even from the 3, my hood was angry at me, shit

But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waitin' for a nigga to jump
See I was patient but was ready to duck
'Cuz you my brother chump
Real Gs never buckle up

But every family ain't filled wit gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down
Even if you turned around muthafucka

You was my nigga, my nerd, my joy, my herb
My main muthafuckin' man Turk
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left

Remember how we played to the left
And we stayed out of trouble 'cuz we stayed to our self
Remember Slim and B were leavin', handin' the ki's over
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the stunna
Yeah those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I honor my brother
Yea nigga sub mage my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The nigga you left behind is my brothers
