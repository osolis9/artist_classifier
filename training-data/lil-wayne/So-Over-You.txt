[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
No regrets allowed
I'm high and I hope you can catch the fall
Welcome to my lecture hall
You can't shake my infection off
Take me to your leader and
I promise I will be the man
Swim until I see the sand
Then die soon as I reach the land
The water's over our hands
What happened to our plans?
Swim until I see the sand
Then die soon as I reach the land!

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
This is my resurrection, so fuck your resolution
I don't need no protection, I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe
Don't care what you believe
Cause I'm so over you, yeah I'm so over you
Yeah I fly over you, cause I'm so over you

[Verse 2 - Shanell]
Ohhhhh 
I did everything by the book, book, book
Scribbling all over all of the notes that I took, took
Find that you're no better than a crook, ooh!
Set and developed I felt I could trust you, struck
Showed them a picture of my ID
That's not enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror, now who should I be-lieve? 

[Chorus]


[Lil Wayne:]
Ha!
Don't know what to believe (huh)
Don't know what to believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (huh)
Don't care what you believe (yeah)
Don't know what to believe (huuuh)
Don't know what to believe (yeaaaaah)
Don't know what to believe (huuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaah)
Yeaah!
Huh!
