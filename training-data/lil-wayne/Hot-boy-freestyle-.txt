Fuck wrong with you

Come through looking like the old me
White t-shirt and Girbaud jeans
Smoking og, I'mma og
Sippin' coedine, I'm a whole fiend
Been a hot boy since 14
Gotta get my money for my army
You can see my right by the Walgreens
I was 14, having orgies
I work hard, real-real real hard
And a broke ass nigga, just steal his broad
She ask me 'bout the tear drop in front of my face
I told that bitch these tears of joy
I gotta big ass house, got cameras everywhere
Big ass closet, I don't know what I'mma wear
Even in my chain, the game don't change
A pimp gon' be pimp and a ho gon' be herself
These niggas must think about it
Cocaine cowboy, nigga like howdy
Codeine drop, tell them boys I got it
Nit picky bitch, don't [?]
Hot boy Tunechi, all the hot girls love me
My clique brazy, everybody clutchin'
Everybody cuffin, everybody muddy
Stunna not around but everybody stuntin'

Bitch I'm ballin' like a hot boy
Hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy Juvie
That's still my big brother, always told me I was best in this music
Yeah, ballin' like a hot boy
Hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy nigga Lil Weezy
I'm still the best rapper, I ain't hungry, nigga, I'm greedy
Ballin' like a hot boy, hot boy, hot boy
Hot boy, hot boy nigga free B-Gizzle
That's still my big brother, been gettin' locked up since we was little
Ballin' like a hot boy, hot boy, hot boy
Hot boy, hot boy nigga Young Turk
That been my brother since day one, like January the first

Oh yeah, you know, you know them niggas owe me
Like Scarface, that's okay
I'm going OJ, OJ, go DJ
I want my bands nigga, like Coldplay and Green Day
I'm talkin' crazy, I'm hot, bitch I'm blazin'
I'm wavy, the hot boys, I was the baby
Your favorite, when they vacated then I debated
I delayed it, now nigga we made it
Yeah, I been paid since them days
I invest, I stock trade
From Eagle Street, to Wall Street
To ya'll street in that drop head
In that hot summer, on that hot leather
With them tiny wheels and them shiny thangs
Bad bitch that's into trying things
I'm too hot, call me Johhny Blaze

And you, hot girl and my hot girl just sittin' by the Bayou
And my hot girl told your hot girl, I got a hot boy that's on fire
She talkin' 'bout that hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy Tunechi
5 Hunnid degrees, nigga 5 hunnid degrees
Hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy nigga Lil Weezy
From hot boy to fireman, I think I hear someone screaming, hold up
I pull up, Mula baby, yeah, hold up, hold up

Bitch I'm ballin' like a hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy gangsta
That's my OG, always taught me how to use my thinker
Lord, I'm ballin' like a hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy, hot boy Elvis
