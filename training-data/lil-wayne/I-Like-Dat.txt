I Like Dat
(Lil.Wayne)
listen up princess...
i wake up in da morinin take a knee and thank god
den go to da mirrior look myself in da eye
today I didnt wake up wit a woman on myside
yesterday I didnt wake up wit a woman on myside
neither the day befor dat not befor dat
i just remember da moments call me kodak
and know dat I do miss you
but its your denial that I must hold against you
sine youve been gone I've been all alone
but alone is steriods cause it made me strong
grr... her gone in da wind
you cheated on god son baby girl dats a sin
but I forgive you but I cant give you
another chance ma your in my rearview
and I put dat ring on your finger I was all in
but now its just a symbol of wat could have been gotdamn

(chorus)
And now Im by myself but.. I like dat
she left me all by myself but.. I like dat

(Lil.Wayne)
look..
I love my niggas no homo I swear I hope dey all get chees like digornio
its something bout da hot boyz dat you dont know
I got alot of love for them that I dont show
and BG been my nigga since da fornt door I hope choppa city records blow for show
and me and Juvi never really got along
but you still will let your nigga come get on your hottest song
damn I fuck wit you foe dat
I fuck wit you lil.wet

when you see a real nigga you got to tip your hat
and since Im a real nigga I do just dat
I had my own lawyer workin on turf's case
after I heard him dissin me on the mixtape
cause hes locked up and Im free
he got a lot more to worry bout then me I aint trippin

(chorus)
