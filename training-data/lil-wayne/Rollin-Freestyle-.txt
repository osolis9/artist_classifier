G5 sitting on the runway
Big ass chopper call that bitch Beyonce
This for my dawgs locked down all day
Money, power, respect 3 the hard way
I put some real n-ggas on their feet, boy
So they’ll kill anyone for me, boy
Yeah, YMCMB boy
Young Tunechi fresh to death
Rest in peace, boy
My Gat bang your hat hang
Gotta ride of with Mack Maine
I drink Patron straight
You n-ggas keep that champagne
My pa is the Birdman
I’m rich as a white man
I come to your show and kill you
And your hypeman
We roll in let’s roll out
My b-tches don’t hold out
They got Marley G
I gotta burn my lil bro out
Let my dreads grow out
My b-tch got a blow out
Mi casa, su casa
My house is, a ho house
Only f-ck with, real n-ggas
Polo, f-ck that Hilfiger

Feed you to my little n-ggas
Shout out to my big homies
Fifi and T-Streets
Scope on that AK make me take a sneak peek
T, roll another one
Razor blade on the tongue
You ain’t never seen this watch
N-gga, this a wonder one
You n-ggas is honey-bun
Your girlfriend a ton of fun
Chopper with a drum muthaf-cker
Give the drummer son
Cut that like my blunt is done
Suck a n-gga’s dick or something
Put that p-ssy for me then wild out
And then give my n-gga’s some
I’ma do my thing
I put that on Nicki Minaj, I need a bad redbone
To come give my dick a massage
I’m talking big money
I’m talking heavyweight
I cut down on the syrup
Now I’m in better shape
I’m from New Orleans n-gga
Where you ain’t never safe
Who f-ck with me I drop you off
In front of Heaven gates
OK, jump off a building
Jump out a window
Smoke like a donkey
And f-ck like a nympho
Drink like a goldfish
That’s right you know this
Hold up click-clack
OK, I’m reloaded
F-ck with Lil Tunechi
I’m good I’m Gucci
Wild as Ryu
I hit you with that Hadouken
My money too long, n-gga
My weed too strong, n-gga
F-ck everybody
I’m in my own zone n-gga
And every time you see me I’m wet and I’m rolling
Tunechi rest in peace, fresh to death
And I’m rolling
About to f-ck a b-tch

N-gga we rolling, n-gga I’m rolling
Gotta keep a title
