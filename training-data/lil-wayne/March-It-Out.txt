Look, I Bought It Out Like Stunna
I Hope When We Dis It We Make Ya Sick To Ya Stomach
Stuntin Like My Daddy And Ya Mamma Eat Rubbas
I Bet That I Can Do The Mouth To Mouth With Ya Woman
My House Is A Dungeon
Yellow Diamond Ring Lookin Like A Little Funion
Stand On My Toes You Can Call Me Paul Bunyan
Switchin Up My Floors Like A Nigga Do Construction
The Microphone Wet Cuz My Words Like Seduction
N Wen We On Tha Jet Ya Dont Come Up In The Discussion
And If Ya Say Ya Ballin We Prolly Dont Trust Ya
I Got? That Prolly Wont Fuck Ya
Even If Ya Bad Boy They Prolly Wont Fuck Ya
Only If I Say She Can Touch Ya Like Busta
But She Mite Touch Ya N Burn Ya Like Usha

Granddaddy Purp Or Bubba Kush Crusha
Explode In A Bitch Mouth Like A Gusha

I Am Just A Martion Get Prepared For Abduction

I Walk It Out Like Cruthches
Two Girls Jump Me Like Double Doutches
My Nigga T-Streets Know A Girl Named Doutches
N Everytime We See Her In The Streets She Be Cussin
I Told Her She Need To Wave The Black Flag Cuz She Buckin
He Say The Pussy Good
He Say Ya Dig So I Dug Up
