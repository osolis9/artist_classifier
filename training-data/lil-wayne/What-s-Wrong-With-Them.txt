Uh, life on the rocks, too hard to swallow
So we get high till it feel like the sky low
Y'all boys just a bunch of pussy cats milo
Money is the song, pockets on high note
Do, ra, me, fa, so

I rock like a fossil, big ball shit, Paul Castellano
Shoot ya ass up, now crawl out the condo
That's that nine nigga, 'lil rando
Sleepin' with the enemy so I fuck the world
To Miss Louise Anna, the sweetest southern girl
The sweetest southern girl, the sweetest southern girl

This is times up, put your signs up
Made 'em pick my dude, I be line up
Baby, what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?

You see money you call, very few are chosen
Lookin' at the wall you can feel them close in
Baby, what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?

Uh, mind over matter, money over all
The world is on my shoulders
Shall I dust my shoulders off?
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knockin' over walls

Fuck the bullshit but just don't fuck it raw man
Pussy has a pattern and I know where I'm goin'
And if you got beef I turn into a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life

I wonder if you'll pay attention, if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part
Man I'm fly as fuck, you ain't even next to depart
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art

This is times up, put your signs up
Made 'em pick my dude, I be line up
Baby, what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?

You see money you call, very few are chosen
Lookin' at the wall you can feel them close in
Baby, what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?

Steppin' on the bullshit, you can be my doormat
Y'all ain't goin' nowhere with that hatin' shit, four flat
Disrespectful on the beat, Borat
Fuck the system and the pussy wasn't all that

Yeah, now time's gettin' shorter
Life on ya head like fuckin' read Carter now
Don't you cross me, you do better crossin' the border
So much money piled up, I'm a motherfuckin' hoarder

This is times up, put your signs up
Made 'em pick my dude, I be line up
Baby, what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?

You see money you call, very few are chosen
Lookin' at the wall you can feel them close in
Baby, what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
