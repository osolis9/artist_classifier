I'm in the kitchen over the stove with pots and pans
Triple color with the platinum jam
50 birds, homeboy in the back of a van

A hundred grand in rubber bands
We got them birds in the coffee cans
We got the whips wit the extra clips
Got bit**es outta state, ni**az flippin' them bricks

Been in the caddy, been in the alley
Ni**a been on the block
Right in front of Mrs. Gladdies
Ni**a know about hustlin', know about stuntin'
Did the curb servin' shyned every summer

Been on front, been in the back
Ni**a roll wit duck tape and ride wit the mac
We see these haters like fu** them ni**az

Yeah, kick my bit**, tell her open the blinds
And I'm, over the stove at 9
Yeah, I'm cookin' breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine

Yeah, quick line in the bathroom before we bounce
Not me, I mean her she go a day a ounce, damn
Y'all pray for her while I'm at the bus station
In the Bentley sittin' low as I wait for her

I'm gettin' dough, I'm a paper boy, I will take ya
For the right paper boy, I will take her
Shake her, tape her, waist up
Send her to the money, she be back before I wake up

Get cha cake up, y'all ni**az lame ducks
Ya probably get ya game up when I'm givin' the game up
My name Wayne what? Hot boy flame up
You ni**az tryin' to change up and I'm gettin' my change up
