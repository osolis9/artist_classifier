But I ain't speaking to 'em, I call my guns Jumpers cause my bullets just leapin' to 'em
All you boys bustas, so soft, bet the wind blew 'em, I claim flame I am just re-kin duel in,
My intuition is get payed, but this glock will knock you back to 5th grade, I school you niggas but none of yous will get A's
Got a bitch who won't stop till everyone of us get laid, lotta of you niggas is son of a bitch made
And if your girlfriend utter, I cut her like switch blades, yeaa, we ridin' like roller blades
Now gon give me head 'till it fall off-a your shoulder babe, I smoke a O a day, that's why I'm so away
Mentally mind blown now gon & blow away, yea, ya'll niggas is super fake, I put you niggas on mute then I mutilate yeaa
Imac like the computer say, my hoes coperate, I mean cooperate
I don't know how to say, oh but I gotta say, I just 4-5 away till ain't no one alive to say
That I 4-5'd away, then I drive away, paper chasin' money runnin' like andale
Better find a way, better not be in our way, I'll take you farther than Zimbabwe
I make it harder for these wimps I stay on their necks no lettin' up, and I tote that can but don't make me bust your 7 up
Heaven up hell down man down gal down and I keep that hammer do you wanna get nailed down
Better kneel down, cause I am the god, I am the har-dest motherfucka to try it before, my diet is ya'll
I riot and war, fightin' them all, bitin' them all, giant or small, I am a dog, I can smile at them bitches and brighten them all
I am a hog (writin)them all, I just lay that pipe and I'm off, call me plumber, and give your girl my number, (humber)
I am a bumblebee on a (humba), your girlfriend want my pickle and my cucumber
Tell your boyfriend I'll turn into to a vegetable, break a nigga down to a decimal
I'm tellin' you I'm very cool unless a fool, fuckin' up my revenue, I tote that whatever dude, I shoot at whatever dude
Just bought a Lamborghini Murcielago, and my girl from the bay say it's hella cool
Where's the helipad, my helicopter land, I shot the man, if I'm not the man, hmm
Do I go in, or I go in, I'm not your friend, I'm not your (kin), I make your brain come out your chin
Been in the game since the beginning, I'm all about winning. I look down I see them, when I look up I don't see any
You pooh like Winnie, do I diddy, and I just left but your boo right with' me
And I'm from never do right city, but don't get me wrong, Young Money I'm gooone
Yeaaa, Young Mulaa Baabbbyyyyy
