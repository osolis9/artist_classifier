Heart's what it is
Watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
All for the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost when I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Doing nothing but mothers stacking pussy coffin again
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cook it and I'mma serve her
Further, guess what I'mma go do with this women when we're eating Gerber?
Mama said to kill 'em all, and I heard her
Thank you, Baby, for what became Lil Wayne
It's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name it's been a change in my lane
I'm a cluster-fuckin', lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
When they be bussin' 'nough, they thinkin' they thugging tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the game, you bang
You drugging, touching everything, you lame?
Sucka, you cannot sustain the rain
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Baller nigga, Strange Music, coupe through swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo business

Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga all those flows are borrowed, it’s the phar-oh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cai-ro, lookin’ at stars so bright in the sky I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those? A whole carload of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender, please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s a symbol like nobody, he’s a symbol of what’s safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body, she’s the only girl that was smart enough to call me Mr. Benjamin in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon, I pound it harder, how come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well, tonight, then, we gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than welcome to the Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head, and I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead
Out
