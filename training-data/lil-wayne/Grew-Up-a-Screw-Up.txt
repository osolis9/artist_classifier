[Chorus:]
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
[Lil Wayne:]
I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game now I'm at the head like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up it's war time
It's Weezy baby no cryin no lyin
These mothafuckas is slippin' they betta hold on
They trippin' like Cedric and Solange
I flow like I'm headless no mind
I can say dont rhyme and it's gon rhyme
I'm so fresh I should be smacked like D. Bonds
And you get smacked like a baseball by B. Bonds
I'm to the point I could kill a nigga with three lines
Watch this... with three lines
We got the tuss and the blunts is dipped three times
We light them mothafuckas up and get tree high
And in the game im manning up like eli
R.I.P. B.I...
[Chorus:]
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fuckin' blew up
