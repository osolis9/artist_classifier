Lil Wayne]
I walked up to her, walked off with her
Them other hoes trash and Weezy dont litter
I told her I'mma rapper, I used to be a killer
Beat the pussy up, Thrilla in Manilla
Im fresh to death, where the casket at?
When she walk, watch her booty do the cabbage patch
Picture me all in it, yeah Flash and Snap
Im outta this world, Globe, Atlas, Map
This is spaceship love, Neptunes on the beat
I got a priceless flow but I can show you receipts
My bitch so bad Im so stress free
But she know I'mma dog and that's her pet peeve
And I . talk to the girl dont beat around
She asks me how it going and I say its going down
Now Tunechi is the name, Young Money on them bitches
This is for my mo'fucking hot shine bubbalicios
