[Lil Wayne]
Uh, fresh out my Bugatti, Polo on my body
I’m jumpin’ in this shit like a pogo on a potty,
So she come and talk to me like Casey, JoJo, and Devante
I say hi my name is Weezy and I know you know Omarion
Haha, I get it in like parking spots
And they say money talk, so don’t ask me why I talk a lot
Girl I’ll kiss your softest spot, I’ll buy your apartment out
Actually I just bought a house, I get it in and walk ‘em out
I done got the dreads braided up, hair long long
And I’m with a redbone, that don’t want leave her thong on
It’s too big, it’s too wide, it wont fit
But I get it in
[End]
