I'm with a hundred and one niggas we dalmatian doggy Deep
And fly with the tongue so if you feelin froggy, leap
Kermit you better think before you ribbit
Don't be murdered over your song before add libit
I pop up like exzibit
Forget it I'm at your krivitz
Not to put no fuckin' fish tanks in your civics
Fuck getting your ride pimped
Ull get hard tyed wimped
Have u in da trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year mayb I shud ride with limp
Cause your boy jus stay above the game
They tryna tag em, spray a brotha frame
But your shots can't reach me I'm way above your aim
Go 'head nigga, say another name
Take dis family for a joke I had Wayans brotha games
And I'm a get u sucka I've been scheming with dis keenan
Aimin with dis Damon/I'm puttin dat major pain in
My lil man zonia marlon and shawn ya
Lay da beef on dis noodle
Make some noodle lasagna
40 cal fetticine tres pound pasta
You reach for dis medallion you must like Italian, nigga
You only see me pushin if the drivers side
I work da s6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop top, dey say the social drive expired
So you could call a cab once your bitch fall for fab
