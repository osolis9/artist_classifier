I hear your steps when you walk,
And I love the way you talk,
Just can't forget your smile,
Baby, I like your style,
Come and stay for the night,
Everything will be alright,
My devotion never stops,
Take it to the top.

I've been crying in the rain, Deep down feel my pain,
Are you longing for much,
Girl, I'm burning for your touch,
All I need is just a smile,
I can't wait a while,
You love it, I live it,
I take it to the limit

Give me Passion,
free me, heal me,
hear my body talk:
so take me to the limit,
take me to the point,
take me to the limit, take me to the limit,
take me to the point,
take me to the, take me to the, take me to the limit.

No love like yours,
In the whole wide world,
It's precious like a pearl,
It's turn me up and down,
And in and out,
Makes me feeling strong and proud,
So take me to the limit.

When I'm turning off the light,
My body starts to shiver,
I've been searching for you,
All around the world,
And now you're mine - you're mine.
