Hey, dipset, weezy holla at me

Welcome to the concrete jungle
Got snakes, got bears, got lions, no muzzles
And they all tryin' to cause me trouble
Got the big tre-8 long nose no muzzle

Aight, aight, hold up, drummer
Where you get that shit form nigga
Man, that's exclusive
Run that, they fuck back, aight

Welcome to the concrete jungle
Got snakes, got bears, got lions, no muzzles
And they all tryin' to cause me trouble
Got the big tre-8 long nose no muzzle

Back up off me shorty, if not, surely
That piece'll come off me shortly
My hood breed ganstaz boy
You wanna be down
Let's see now, no thank you, boy

My niggaz'll fish fillet you, boy
Than go and tell ya moms to get the paper boy
Ya son is just no longer a paper boy
He's front page on the paper boy, read about it

Extra, extra read about it
But we get twisted laugh and smoke weed about it
And can't nobody do a thing about it?
'Cuz they'll be in the same boat, literally the same road

Floatin' across the same sea
Through the same water, don't fuck wit them same G's
Don't fuck wit that man, please
Don't fuck wit his money, don't fuck wit his gang breed

Aim squeeze, Wayne be on the back street
Shotty on the back seat, fuck 'em if you ask me
Make 'em look but them niggaz can't look past me
Past the weed to the next nigga, that's me

Let's see P E N C A M G
21 inches and I got them bitches skindy
Temp me and any thing can happen, I ain't rapper
I ain't shootin' at you, soldiers, bitch, I'm goin' for the captin'
I ain't shootin' at yo' shoulders, bitch, I'm goin' for ya cap

And  I won't stop cappin' to yo' wings, start flappin'
And you, you're just angel in the streets full of gangtas
And me I'm from the home where murder make ya famous
And I think, I'm 'bout 2 get that trech off the hanger
And the mask out the door but I'll neva have to bang

I'm a straight playa, if you love her, don't bring her
I'll tell her lil' shit like I can make her ass a singer
And she believe that we back at the crib
She like, how it shoot if it's plastic fo' real
I'm like fall back, ma, ya ass can get chilled

Then she rolled on my dick like an ecstasy pill
I smoke Beverly hills what eva that kills
And leave a nigga wit that heavenly feel, yeah
Step and I will step in ya grill, yeah
And leave a nigga wit that heavenly, field
