You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living
I tell em' I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it
If she steal it, I'mma kill her
I bulletproof the ride
Now I feel like armadillas
And fuck your hospital
Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis
Self-made G and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five
My favorite movie was the Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this
But I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a little intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean swimming with the pigeons
See my World is Different
Like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch I want the same thang

And you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
â€˜Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high, you see that I'm gonna be in it
The sky is the limit

Buck Ten in the coupe and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap
Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me
My flow is art, unique
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is: eat
By any means, and you're just sardines
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my P.R.Ps
What do you expect
I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, Ima grind till I get it
And Ima tell all my niggas that the sky is the limit

And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulders
Run up in your house
And shoot everyone that's sitting on the living room sofa
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Mom with a dozen of roses
And I'm a G
That you ain't got to know the alphabet to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the streets

You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry about mine, Ima grind till I get it
And tell all my niggas that the sky is the limit
The Sky is the Limit
Hands up in the air because the sky is the limit
Can you see me up there? the sky is the limit
