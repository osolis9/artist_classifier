Lately I've been trying to stop lying
but I be lying if I said that I wasn't blinded by that ass girl
and I would go to hell as well if I say you didn't smell like Victoria's secret when you pass girl
and that plain skirt you got on lets a n-gga know that you just might have some class girl
so you gotta have you some brain
and with all due respect you gotta pass it to Pain
gots to pass it to Wayne
and then the Wayne pass your organ, you pass it to Mack Maine
or I can take you Solo for Dolo
have you getting out of the Lambourghini in slow Mo
but I aint trying to butter you up
I'm trying to f-ck you in the kitchen let me butter you up
where's my manners, which one you like
butter or syrup?
let me show you what Mrs. Butter is worth.

[T-Pain: Chorus]
Ohhhh, what it is,
baby don't act stupid (ohhh noooo)
come on now lets do this
got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
and she already know what it is
baby your so perfect
so I know Im bout merk it
got the waist of a wasp and the ass of a horse
and she already know what it is

[Lil Wayne]
Shorty want a real n-gga
construction hat Weezy Imma build with her
she be my meal after I have a meal with her
then I deal with her
now wont ya shake like a dog
hop like a frog
ride it like a horse
scream, holla till ya lose your voice
lyrics courtesy of Killerhiphop.com
promise I know how to love, know what to do with ya heart
shorty you so much of a target I hit you with a dart
ooh bullseye baby, ooh ayy baby
can I stick my finger in your apple pie baby
now I know everybody want a piece of pie
but you know that they aint greedy as I
now wont you do it like I told you
send a pic I download it
cos I promise in my sidekick you got your own folder
if you keep f-cking with me you gon get your own chauffeur
first put your legs on my shoulders

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
And usually I don't want a whole first time with a girl on the very first night
but you got the power to make a n-gga feel like you
supposed to be a n-gga's wife
and technically I don't believe in falling in love
if the love don't, dont even love
so with you Im gon be giving love yeah
and really I don't be goin out like that no more unless it's a show
but you only go to the top
now whatcha, whatcha think about that
whatcha think about that
whatcha think about that
whatcha think about that
