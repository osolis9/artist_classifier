Wake a nigga up in his bed when he sleep
Tear the nigga up from his head to his feet
Then I light the nigga up from his head to his feet
Put his body in the water and his head on the beach
Light another blunt just to save me the grief
I don't give a fuck I was made for the beef
I don't give a fuck I'm straight from the streets
But I'm crooked as a bitch, bitch wave to the thief
Lie to the bad guy, hi to the good though
Ride with the bad guy, try and get smoked
Lie and get smoked, lie for a nigga though
Try for a nigga though, die for a nigga though
Why would a nigga go to new Orleans?
This is Katrina-land
The president flew over, and he ain't even land

We ain't even mad, we ain't even playin'
It's duck tape season in my region and you ain't leavin' until
We eatin', and I want my piece and I want my peeps
To get they piece, and they want they peeps to get they piece
And until then tell yo peeps no piece
I'mma beast and I feast every beat I seek
And I freak every mixtape CD I leak
I need to be at the t-o-p-o-f-h-i-p-h-o-p
And I'm I-n-d-a-c-u-t-w-i-t-h them Uzzi's
Who me? yes me, call me Weezy West B
Cause I'm wilder than the motherfuckin' wild west be
I'm so ready, are you ready for me
Young-Young Money, Young Mula baby
Break in a nigga car at the light
Put the gun to his head make him park on the right and
Then I tell him don't talk
Make him get out and walk
And then I tell my goons to get right in
When you fuckin' with a nigga like me
No homo but you fuckin' with a rider
They ain't heard me when I tryda

We can do what you want I don't care
Anyhow, anywhere, anytime I swear
As sun up on a nigga, I will run up on a nigga
Put the gun up on a nigga, now I'm one up on a nigga
Yeeahhh
I will run the clock behind the guap
And if my leg broke I will hop
Bitch I will hustle til I drop
Bitch I will throw you from the top, of the world
I got myself a Boston girl
She my gypsy I'm her genie
Ride my magic carpet girl
Flow so sick you cough and hurl
I'm so twisted I walk and swirl
I'm so lifted I walk on clouds
Please please please don't shoot me down
Fuckin' right I put it down
Buy it white then cook it brown
This is how great lookin' sound
KY bring the hook around

Uh, Hollygrove U-S-A, parlez-vous fran-Ã§ais
Hot as picante
I am a zombie, what more can I say
Cause after all I
I told ya'll I tote it
Put the bullet in the Glock and blow that bitch
If you know like I know you'd put money way before that bitch
Everyone got they hand out, so I drop my drawers and let 'em hold that dick
I'mma roll that stick and I'mma roll it thick
And I know I'm cold and when it's cold as brick
And I ain't that old I'm just 26
All in yo mouth like I'm a dentist bitch
Fuck you and yo interest bitch
We on some shoot the entrance shit
Better find the exit boy, my Nina is so sexy boy
And she feelin' desperate boy, don't make her molest ya boy
Pressure pressure boy, what will make you test the boy
I'm great with no effort boy, yo face will get severed boy
I'm breakin' yo level boy, I'm takin yo medal boy
Weezy F Baby and the F is for forever boy!
