I'm the f**kin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya.
Go uptown, New York city b**ch
Some Spanish girls love me like i'm Aventura.

Clubbing hard,f**kin', there ain't much to do
Wrist bling got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang a shhh changed
How you feel, How you feel?
25 sittin' on 25 mil..ok?
I'm in the building and i'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team bad we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "light one, pass it like a relay"

Shout out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout out to Gibbo
We got Santa Margarita by the litter
She know even if i'm f**kin' with her, I really don't need her
That' how you fell, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these b**ch's wanna chill
