(feat. Jay Sean)

[Jay Sean]
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Baby hold it,
and let me holla at you baby for a moment
And if you with it, I'm with it, keep it rollin'
And we'll be dancing and drinking until the morning
Until the morning

Starters going off
It's so hot there's girls just taking all there clothes off
So take a picture of this moment with your iPhone
Cause I don't wanna forget tonight, night, night, night
Put your lighters in the air
Let em burn into the night
And let everybody know
that your with it and your ready to go

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Tonight, tonight
So Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the light
hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way (way, way, way)
Cause it's hot in the club now, so don't let it stop now

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
And everybody say

Uh oh oh, uh oh

[Lil Wayne]
YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Li
All them bitches think they fly,
and all 'em bitches flew to me
Hit the lights so you could see
My drink is strong and my hooka sweet
Understand the time is now, but time is up the futures bleak

Its me, its stupid cupid
Love me, leave me in the morning
If you like your friend join in
The wildest flower in the garden
Coolest n-gga in the party
Shades on, dread on
Blood gang, red zone
And I'm with Jay Sean

[Jay Sean]
Put ya lighters in the air
Let em burn into the sky
And let everybody know
that your with it and your ready to go

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Tonight, tonight
So Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the light
hit the light
Hit the lights

Come out the dark and let the DJ lead the way (way, way, way)
Cause it's hot in the club now, so don't let it stop now

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
And everybody say

Tell em low, tell em high
Light it up to the sky

Tell em low, tell em high
Light it up to the sky

And everybody say

Uh oh oh, uh oh
