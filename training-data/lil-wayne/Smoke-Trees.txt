I'm in the hood

I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
Somebody say that you was lookin for me, I'm in the hood

I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
Somebody say that you was lookin for me, I'm in the hood

Uptown New Orleans like always
Cash Money boy, shine like bald heads
Big Bezel make my watch look like a hog head
And all I do is smoke trees, call me a log head

I'm butter on the break like Parkay
And I am all about me like Doe Ray
I'm in the hood, in the hood like dope, yay
Nappy ass hair like Buck weed, otay

Holly grove, Ether Street be my damn hood
Where you can get murdered for free like can goods
I got 12 barbaros under the lamb hood
I can bring a Kentucky Derby to the damn hood

Sunshine diamonds help me tan good
And I'll let it blow like a band wood
I'll call Brisco, I'm on South Beach
30 minutes later, Opa-locka is where I'll be

I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
Somebody say that you was lookin for me, I'm in the hood

I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood
I'm in the hood, I'm in the
