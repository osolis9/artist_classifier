(Go) I'm in love with a beauty, she is a cutie
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in the movies
We had a drink or two, we saw Rush Hour 2
Then we went home and we made our own movie

Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

Like OoOoOo, it's goin' down in this bitch
Like a boxer in the first round in this bitch
1-800-i would dicky down in this bitch
Uptown in this bitch, don't make a sound in this shhhhh
Now, let me whisper in your ear
Every single word your little ear wanna hear
Flip your body over, have no fear
Can i put my tongue here until you tear
Cry baby, cry baby, suck your momma tittie
You know i like them old, i might have your momma with me
I like your girlfriend and your girlfriends'
Honor my pole like a flag on the end bitch

Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine

But i don't give a fuck about a dog ass hoe
Say, i don't give a fuck about a dog ass hoe
Pop these pills, take-take this glass
Pop-pop that pussy, shake-shake that ass
And if your pussy stank girl, you know you better dush it
Your nasty girl, now wash that stanky funky-funky pussy bitch
Stop talkin' that shit and suck a nigga dick for an outfit, hah
And i wear my pants below my waist and
I never dance when im in this place
Cuz you and your man be planning to hate
I'm so hood and she likes it
And when we fuck, im keepin on my nikes
I'll tear that pussy up, i'll tear thatat pussy up
I'ma good lookin' rapper, i ain't tryna front
Oooh she pussy poppin' on a handstand
Oooh she pussy poppin' on a handstand
Oooh she pussy poppin' on a handstand
And im the cameraman

Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
It's showtime, it's showtime

Cut, check the gates
Wait, why wait

When i can just bend you over and do what i told ya
Do what i wanna, do what i wanna, ya heard me
I gotta lie like ether
And now every once in a while her knees jerk
She forgets how to walk, i better teach her
I got her walkin' funny, just tell em that your feet hurt
You'll probably see her on one of my t-shirts
I super soak a hoe, skeet-skeet-skeet squirt
But don't worry cuz if y'all are like swingers
Hey, im high over features
Haha new single, oh so now you single
You crazy, say the baby

Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
Lights-Camera-Action, ya dig
It's showtime, it's showtime
Show me yours, show you mine
