[lil wayne]
pull up on 'em bitches, get out, walk
way to many holes, like i play golf
she's somewhere in wayne's world, stranded, lost
bitch catching feeling's like randy: moss
young money shit, got the bathroom door locked
tune go hard, y'all softer than my car top
hank gathers, i'ma ball til my heart stop
nice red bone in a thong and a bra top
looking for a queen from a king-size bed
i can make that p-ssy stand up and drop dead
f-ckin' with lil tune then a nigga get murked
a nigga get kilt like a muthaf-cking skirt
i do it like nike, i'm pyshic i knew you like it
run up in ya ass, than i dash like a hyphen
this is priceless, not for sale
and i unveil, miss shanell
[shanell]
the feeling of your arms around me
i swear that i can't get enough
i'm staying up all night, wishing you were here with me
and when i'm with my girls
they trippin' cause it won't be long
before you have me rushing home
cause, boy you're everything i need
i don't wanna see you leave
i got time if you got me
don't you know you make it feel
so good, good, good
so good, good, good
so good, good, good
soooo gooood
and when ya gone too long
i'm waiting with your t-shirt on
playing love songs
you make me feel good
you tell me love is crazy
i guess that we are too
there aint a thing i won't do to prove that i'll be here for you

[drake]
you know i wake up like a king, get up, stunt
take advantage of the day, this shit wont happen more than once
know i'm ready for whatever, ready for the action
i'm still focused on my shit but girl i'm up for a distraction
got a body like a stripper, but tell me she a student
but some strippers are students, so i tell that bitch to prove it
ya know, yeah show me all your books and suck my d or somethin
i just wanna know that you can teach me something
[shanell]
boy, you're everything i need
i don't wanna see you leave
i got time if you got me
don't you know you make it feel
so good, good, good
so good, good, good
so good, good, good
soooo gooood
