Tool on deck, why would I lie
Nigga you a pussy hope you got nine lives
I could hit a nigga with the nine nine times
Country ass boy country like leanne rhymes
Mississippi d banner, and lilweezyana
Everybody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill poppin animal, syrup sippin nigga
I'm so high you could'ntreach me with a fuckin antennae
You're fuckin with his man, you could be his man dinner
The nine gimme brains but the ak add liver
Your rapper is the same flowin like a bad river
Make yo ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove hardshow, hardtime giver
I'm a shark in the water you just long john silver
I got a girl you wanna meet her?
Her name is nine millimeter

Uptown new orleans like always
Cash money boys shine like ballheads
Big bezzel make my watch look like a hog head
But all I do is smoke trees call me log head
I'm butter on the bread like parkay
And I am all about me like do re
I'm in the hood, in the hood like dope yay
Nappy ass hair like buckweed otay
Hollygrove keep the street be my damn hood
Or you can get murdered for free like canned goods
I got 12 barber rolls that glow yam hood
I could bring kentucky derby to the damn hood
Sunshine diamonds, call me tanned goods
And now I let it blow, like a bad wood
I call brisco, I'm on southbeach
Stunnin minutes later open locker is where I be

Man I'm so hollygrove
Stand strong in the water like a commador
Black hoes in your white tee, dominos
Me n brisco cash money carnivals
Hehe, I am new orleans like carnival
And in the hood call me weezy the honorable
These other rappers so ironical,
And if I ain't in the mansion then I'm up in the phantom oh
Yea, you know it, listen up man, dj cinema, cinematic,
Whatever you wanna call him, I need you to spin this thang crazy
Spin this when I tell you not to, talkin about 8 in the mornin,
To 8 in the mornin, ya feel me, yea, can fox holla at cha boy
