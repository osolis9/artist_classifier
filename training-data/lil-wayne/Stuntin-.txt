Dramatic nigga

Well, alright, here I go
I'm a rapper turned singer and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal chords, all I hit is C notes
N E R D flow, I spaz if I'm provoked
I'm about to change the fuckin' game, pass the remote

Money is everything and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, it's the motto that my brotha sang
Cash is the right now, women are the post game
Money over bitches dot com, check the domain

It's comin' too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say yup once in the blue moon
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again to 'em
Let me leave a station for your blood affiliation

I say heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I can rap around these other youngin's like a cobra snake
Frost bite drizzy nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in line, don't be tryin' to roller skate

Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit
I am twenty one, tell me who do I compete with
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real
'Cause I'm getting hood lovin', I ain't even talkin' street shit

Young angel, young lyin' and I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin 'cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' John B

And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This is for all the stripper 'cause I know that they gonna bump it
Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it

Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin' full circle, get up on my axis

Maybe I'ma kill 'em only 'cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party unless I got some bottles in the booth

I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just having patience 'cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a fo' in it and appreciate the greatness

Gangsta
I just want y'all to remember
That this is the first mixtape you bump while you have a black president

Yeah, pass the dro', I am such a beast and you ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
They're only scared 'cause it's just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I thought that 'Boombastic'

I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes, I'm falling but up I fall
And if ya bitch in heat, she can fuck my dog

I went from penny pension to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter Carter ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suit y'all order

Whatever y'all please, wine crackers and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tease
This supplement I'm taking got me feeling mighty
My gun and money, don't split call that shit Siamese

Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And eighteen G's is why the chicken crossed the street

What you know about it? My niggas so about it
If we kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire
I am Michael, Michael Myers, leave my body in the dryer

Got the shawty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty
Oops, I meant a casualty, oops, I meant catastrophe
Oops, I meant actually you niggas is just ass to me
And big wet pussy is more like what I'm lathering

Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery
You got short salary and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch

Gangsta
See I told y'all it'll be well worth the wait, right?
Dedication 3, Chris fuck with me
C'mon it's Mr. Thanksgiving you're talking about
Thanks for sure
