Now it was me and lil cc and we was chilling by ourselves
--- popped a pill and now I'm feeling myself
All these cuts on my wrist, it's like I'm killing myself
Diamond cuts is what I mean, im so hot I might melt
Only in your bitch mouth, nigga what'chya talking 'bout
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking bout this
Don't worry 'bout me, worry bout my bitch
Don't worry 'bout me, worry bout my bitch

I got a bitch named Nina, and Nina's so slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies yeah
She'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Protection off, safety - I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas Weezy", that's what the 380 said
"I got them niggas Weezy", that's what the 380 said
That's what the 380 said, that's what the 380 said

Man ya'll ain't ready, I'll take one -- me and Lil Terry
And we hold court like Mason Perry
Oops, I meant Perry Mason, the weed got me dyslexic
I've been hungry since I in the lane, looking for an exit
Eat or get ate, and you looking like breakfast
You done took it too far, now don't stretch it
Damn, my bitch sexy
And my bitch slutty, cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies yeah
She'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Yeah, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies

In the back of the 'Bach, its just me and my little brother bitch
We call him Little Snack
Um, why we call him that? cause he like to eat snacks
And I like to eat rappers like he like to eat snacks
I call em emcee snacks, you emcees wack
How 'bout your funeral? Let me emcee that!
Three emcee facts, my name's Dwayne Michael Carter, DMC's back!
Nigga walk this way, and I'm gonna paint your ass like an art display
I'm really rich, I just talk this way
And maybe if you get rich you'll talk this way!
See, right now I'm talking foreign, you dig? I'm talking foreign -
Leave a hole in the boy big enough to park a car in
You're on, but you ain't on it, I'm more on like warren
Move, boom! now my bitch talking for me
Damn, and she's so slutty, cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Man, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
