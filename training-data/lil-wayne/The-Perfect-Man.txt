Bitch I'm picture perfect
I paint a perfect picture
I'm spooning with your bitch
And make you do the dirty dishes
Man I hate the thirsty bitches
Cut them off like circumcision
I'm the type to talk shit
And it'd be words of wisdom

Uh, tried to fuck the world can't fit
Pockets fat as Saint Nick
All I've got is my niggas
Cause a bitch still ain't shit
And I've got kush all in my swisher
These niggas is tissue
I don't believe these niggas
Cause I don't believe in superstitions
Juvie, I gotcha dreads like rasta
Hair like pasta I go meatballs
I get up in that ass
And hit it as fast as Chinese ping-pong
And my bitch she got that fire
My homie got that iron
But I tell 'em put it away
Or you could get punched like a Hawaiian

Bitch I'm N.O till I G.O
I can't change if I tried
I look to my left, I look to my right
And time ain't on my side
So that's why I like my blunt
Fat and outta shape
Money on my mind
Pussy on my face
Tunechi
