Aston Martin Driver, gave away the B(entley) Coupe,
cried for three days, after that I had to re-group,
bullet-proof suburban, nigga fuck with that,
shoot the tires out, drive 60 miles on a flat,
flip the motherfucker over watch it slide on its back,
let the windows up as bullets fly out the Mac,
no gunpowder on me, I'm as fly as the Mac,
