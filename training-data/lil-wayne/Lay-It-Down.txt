YMCMB, bitches call me Tunechi Lee
I be with niggas that shoot police
I keep that iron, you could get creased 
And if she say she didn't fuck
Bitch, you’re lyin' through your teeth 
Paid cost to be the boss 
The ones in jail wish they were free 
Niggas call me how I see
Because I’m high as you can see 
Niggas say they paid they dues 
While I’m checkin' your receipt 
Might as well go stupid 
Since this is a stupid beat 
Grab the owl out the tree 
And ask that bitch who but me? 
Got your bitch bent over 
Nigga, hands to her feet 
Tell that pig and that cow 
I go HAM if it’s beef 
‘Cause all my niggas rail round it 
Don’t fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah
Draw down then erase niggas
I'm a Blood, is you a blood donor?
Swisher full of that California
I hit it sideways, catacomb her
Catch that nut like pneumonia, Tunechi

Lay it down, hoe
Lay it down, bitch
Lay it down, hoe
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga
Shut your mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Give me everything up in your house, nigga
Shut your mouth, nigga

[Bridge]
Lay it down, hoe
Lay it down, bitch
Lay it down, hoe
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down

Start it up, vroom vroom... 
Uppercut a bitch off the bus, boom boom
Unless I get the brain, poon poon
She let a nigga run and get the gang, run a train, zoom zoom
Tryna get paid too soon, one deep, one sweep away in the room, room
We gettin' money over here, talkin' shit, fuckin' bitches
I don't know what the fuck they doin' to 'em
I serve purple, my turf Earth 
My birth circle, I'll dirt surf you
I'll squirt, merk you, my verse hurtful 
My shooters still got curb curfews
Y'all 'bout as hot as Von Dutch
Y'all not goin' hard much
Highjack y'all some prom bus
Ain't no retreat, but my arm's up
No graffiti, my bombs up
It's Young Money in this bitch and tell them niggas that ain't goin'
If you wanna set it off, what you wanna bet it on? 
I'm betting the wedding's off when everything's wetted on
Point 'em out, trunk your life
Fuck your style, fuck with me you a bucket foul
Niggas'll buck you, smile, for a ducket, pal
You'd better duck it, pal

Yo... shorty, what's yo name?
Is you tricking, is you paying?
Is you sniffing on that caine?
What the fuck is you saying?
If you gettin it, then you gettin it
It's my money, I ain't splittin it
I ain't trippin it, if she got a fat ass then I'm tippin' it
Came out the bank, bye teller
Give a bum money, hi fella
Bad lil' hoe, hi yella
Brand new Rolie, sky dweller
Just left from Dubai, flew private eye
I made a million dollars, swear to God that ain’t no lie
I said, dumb niggas was poppin, fake niggas be watchin
My black glove be drippin wet, but I got Mike Cochran
Losing ain't no option, I'm teaching bitches my doctrine
The Maybach ain't poppin if it ain't got a Partoshin
Oops I mean partition, it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition
I said Oops I mean partition, it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition
Fuck is wrong with you bitches?
