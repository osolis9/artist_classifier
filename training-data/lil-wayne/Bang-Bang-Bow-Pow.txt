[Chorus - T-Pain]
My money right, my money-money
My bread good, good-good
Shawty fuckin’, wassup girl? that head good
Bang bang, pow pow
I do my thang-thang
Look at me now-now
My money right, my money-money
My cash up, up-up and away
Face down, face down, ass up
I rep my town-town, that’s where I’m from-from
So nigga pow pow, bom bom
[Verse 1 - T-Pain]
Money to blow, I’m living off tour
Boatloads of cash, bitch I’m overboard
I got money for these whores if you open up the door
Company accounts and they all wanna course
Real talk I don’t speak, even if it’s: “hi hater”
I’m on top and I done locked the elevator
All these bitches say I’m fly and I can never touch the ground
I’m not tryna be in ya circle cause I don’t fuck around
I get that money, that money-money
I live it, I want it, drop the top on that Ferrari
Now I’m in California
I let the hard top down and the wind blow through
All I do is win, what the fuck you gon’ do?
Good, good, good
And I do this for my hood, hood, hood
Yeah and ain’t nobody gonna stop me, I’m doing it right now
So bang bang, pow pow, everybody say:
[Chorus - T-Pain]
My money right, my money-money
My bread good, good-good
Shawty fuckin’, wassup girl? that head good
Bang bang, pow pow
I do my thang-thang
Look at me now-now
My money right, my money-money
My cash up, up-up and away
Face down, face down, ass up
I rep my town-town, that’s where I’m from-from
So nigga pow pow, bom bom
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Uh, I go so hard they call me Go So Hard
You ain’t a king, you a joker card
Fuckin’ up the Church money like a alter boy
I got them yellow zannies, that’s them Tonka toys
I go bonkers boy, I put that on my mom and ‘em
The hoes are all alike, they put the hoe in homonym
I think all these niggas sound like me, that’s a compliment
I told a midget: “bitch, I do it big”, hippopotamus
Put that on my slime and ‘em, no B-ball we stop and pop
No b-ball we got shit locked, swagger ill, wassup doc?
Make that pussy pop like the gun I went to jail for
Shoot the doors off ya jeep, that bitch look like a mail truck
You pussy keep ya tail tucked, real niggas in this bitch
Get that pussy wet, fuck her then I jet, Kenny Smith
T-Pain voice: “all I do is win”, and shit
Young Money in yo’ motherfuckin’ face, blemishes
Owww
[Chorus - T-Pain]
My money right, my money-money
My bread good, good-good
Shawty fuckin’, wassup girl? that head good
Bang bang, pow pow
I do my thang-thang
Look at me now-now
My money right, my money-money
My cash up, up-up and away
Face down, face down, ass up
I rep my town-town, that’s where I’m from-from
So nigga pow pow, bom bom
