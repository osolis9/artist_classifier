Cut the music up...
Li'l loud
Yeah...

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

For a second you were here, why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving around
Like you never had a love
Had a love

When you was just a young and your looks was so precious
But now your grown up so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a guy look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

For a second you were here, why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving around
Like you never had a love
Had a love

I'm the handy man of love so
You know I'm gon' fix it
Your heart got a boo boo so, baby let me kiss it
Let me show you what these blind dudes really missin'

You don't gotta be alone
We can both do the sentence
Ridding you of villians is my super hero mission
Just open up your eyes and see the future not the distance

Lookin' at the past only calls for resistance
I just wanna see you smile, baby girl I'm a dentist...
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
