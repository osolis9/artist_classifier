Man, f-ck these niggas
Tunechiâ€™s back, Tunechiâ€™s back
Thats all these bitches screaming that Tunechiâ€™s back
All eyes on me
Nigga pictâ€™ how Iâ€™m rollinâ€™
Strapped up with that mac
Masked up like a goalie
Mad my bitch on that coke
She snorted 4 on the bed
Now the bitch on me
She selling p-ssy and pay me

They sayinâ€™ Tunechiâ€™s back, Tunchiâ€™s back
And I bought them twins with me, nigga, click and clack
Lets go

Out on bail
Work on the scale
Put some change on ya head
Boy, you on sale
Yeah I see you in hell
Pop pop get well
Make breakfast cause I got you walking on egg shells
Zan with that lean
I aint a begginâ€™ muthaf-cka
But nigga please
And I aim this muthaf-cka at your memories
And all my niggas bloods but we make you niggas bleed
Yeah, bloody mary
Iâ€™m the one with the money so I aint the one with the gun
All I do is give the word to the one with the gun
Iâ€™m triple OG, fugue splitting the sweet
F-ck bitches get money
Mission complete

Man f-ck these niggas I aint worried bout â€˜em
These niggas pure p-ssy, pull a pearl out em?
Yeah, I got a virgin I call her Madaonna
But I aint trippin, her head is a monster
Yeah, we do this for real
Swear to God I never shoot unless Iâ€™m shooting to kill
Young wild mutha-fcka pop you and a pill
Boy instead of writing raps you should be writing your will
You a dead man, I get to poppinâ€™ this bitch
Watch where your head land
I aint right I swear to God, I need my head scanned
Stand up and eat that p-ssy while she on a head stand
Iâ€™m a dog hoe, camo cargoâ€™s, semi autoâ€™s
My bitch sniff more lines than a barcode
Yeah
Wish I could take a shot of Ciroc with Pac
Sorry for the wait til my album dropâ€¦
