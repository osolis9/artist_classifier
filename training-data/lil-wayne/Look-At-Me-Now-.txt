[Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missing
Yeah yeah
That sh-t look like a toupee

I get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me
I'm on my cool J
If you get what I get what would you say
She wax it all off, Mr Miyagi
And them suicide doors, Hari Kari

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthaf-cker

Lil n-gga bigger than gorilla
Cause I'm killing every n-gga that
Try to be on my sh-t
Better cuff your chick if you with her
I can get her
And she accidentally slip fall on my dick
Ooops, I said on my dick
I aint really mean to say on my d-ck
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm Done

[Twista]

Now let a track go past like this and Twista not fuck with it, y'all done lost your mind
I could hit you with the auto-matic-flow, I could do any rhythm and any pattern
That I wanna do the harder that it go, you could see blood spilling out from a body
Right in front of you, and imma get the dough, now the way I be shinin be havin everybody lookin at me
Fuckin them up when I buck up I step up and ball. I do a murder when im trigger happy like
I got the intricate power to kill her for currency when im be anna but imma be making â€˜em holler
Cause im a kedavers when im attackin the beat Im a scholar cause im a personification of god,
So you better honor (what!?) Mr. immaculate now im breakin it, marble sack your lyricist
I'll be here forever, haters wanna hate on me because they wanna hear whatever
I could spit a rhythm to a bitch and get her pussy wetter,
pimpin on a bitch and tell her I could get her pussy cheddar
so I get the camera wanna go and make a movie
me up in the back on top to get the booty , didn't wanna show her face even though she was a cutie
nine millimeter and spillin millions of milliliters of life out a nigga if he talk shit
C.E.O step into my office, comin with the awkward flow like im sick
Go get your momma to bring a thermometer, my temperatures hot
Come up with a flow that would kill a industry, and I could pick anything that I want off the lot
Never compatible cause I be intricate, when I be servin you, when I be doin it, at a place
I know they cant leave me, think Twista could kill em on a track wit busta breezy and weezy? Easy!

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthaf-cker

[Lil Wayne]
Man f-ck these bitch ass n-ggas how yall doin?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the 3 stooges
I dont eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, p-ssy juicy
I never gave a f-ck about a hater got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You n-ggas aint eatin, f-ck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot em, and I said ok,
If you wanted bullshit then I'm like olay,
I dont care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch I'm outta my mind from the bottom I climb
You aint hotter at mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying
Whats poppin Slime? nothin five, and if they trippin f-ck em five
I aint got no time to shuck and jive, these n-ggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and sprite on a private flight
Bitch I'm enticing, guiding light, and my pockets white and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared cause I'm too wild, been here for a while
I was like f-ck trial I puts it down
I'm so young money if you got eyes look at me now bitch

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthaf-cker
