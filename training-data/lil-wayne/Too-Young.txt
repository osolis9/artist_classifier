[Hook]
I walk in, I walk in, I walk in with goons
I'm parking Ferrari, I started like 'vroom'
I'm staggering, I'm flagging, I'm acting a fool, pour up, yeah
I'm sipped out, I'm knocked out in my house all day
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up like 'ay'
I pull up, I pull up and I fade away
That's NBA, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, I used to have braids but I still got the hoes
I loosen my brakes and I still got control
I remember the day I got the Azure
Back when them hoes was wearing Juicy Couture, yeah
Back when niggas was still wearing velour
When Shit got out of hand, my hands was full
I'm going through some shit yeah but you know I ain't broker
Just talked to Ms. Cita, she tell me stay focused
I say "alrighty then", gotta make up my mind again
Fuck the bullshit, the fake and the counterfeit
Gotta shake it like Iverson
Gotta take out my pocket lint and make something out of it
Like a scientist, be creative and confident
No vacation, just power trips
Limo tint, limo tint, 5 percent, Louie V moccasins
Treat her cat like a lioness, I’m on my Mufasa shit
I'm saucy like pasta bitch
I'm talking all kinda, yeah
And I got that Flocka dick, them bitches need all of it
And I be OT with my bro T
And little hoodie and Skate Board-E
And that's my niggas, we fly niggas
With shotguns under both wings
We going up, pouring up
These niggas be hoeing up
Ain't no peace, we chop off both fingers
I got that dope dick, yo bitch is a dope fiend
I got the tattoos, all I need is the nose ring
Pool party at my place, more codeine than chlorine
Spraying at your head like some fucking Afro Sheen
And I'm

[Hook]
A Martian, I'm marching on the stars and moon
I come through in something without a roof
Staggering, I'm flagging, I'm repping Soowoo
Yeah Bloodgang
Look, I hop out, they watch out, I hop out the Wraith
I spin it, I spin it, make it back next day
I pull up, I pull up and I fade away
I send me away yeah

[Verse 2]
I’m my momma’s son
And when I started thuggin I was young
When I started cussing I was one
Momma put that soap on my tongue
And when I started hustlin I was 12
And then I started pumping like the Shell
And when I started fuckin I was young
And when I started cuppin I was sprung
And then I started druggin it was fun
Fucking with that honey I got stung
And when I go out clubbin I be numb
Started up from nothin just some crumbs
Started up from nothin just some crumbs
And now I got a bakery; yum, yum
And now I see the fakery, now I see the snakery
All I got is 2 words, blumb-blumb
No ceilings
