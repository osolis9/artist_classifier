Steppin' out the motherfuckin' car, they in awe
I'm looking like a star, bitch, when you see me make a wish
Holla at ya motherfuckin' boy, J.R
Birdman my pa, bitch; ball bred, born rich
Dear Mr. Toilet, I'm the shit
Got these other haters pissed cause my toilet paper thick
I know, but trip and that .40 make a chip
Out a potatohead wimp and like ranch, I dip
And the hustle was all muscle, just strength
When it comes to that weight I don't struggle, I just lift
I got my hand on the game, yeah I make a grip
Hundred grand in my fist, same on my wrist
Get key money from a quarter, blame it on my wrist
I whip coke like hoes, nigga I'm a pimp
Lil' nigga 'bout to rape the market
If we talking 'bout money, baby now we talking

Fuck bitches Get money Get money fuck bitches
Fuck bitches get money
Fuck bitches get money

Nigga get it in a slump if you know how
In the heart of the summer we need a snowplow
What you know bout that, baby it's yo' time
Coke transactions on the phone we call it "blow job"
Too fast for the feds, too cocky for the cops
Had to ditch my old bitch getting sloppy with the pots
Hopping off the boat meeting Papi at the docks
He tell me I'm gaining weight I tell him I'm getting paid
Money over bitches I'm yelling it to the grave
Developed at a young age, go after what pays
These Gabbana sunshades block the sunrays
I drop a car note in the mall on the first day
I gotta get it even if it's in the worst way
That cake like it's my birthday
New Orleans my birthplace, ya heard me
Where money's more important than the person

Twistin' up a blunt thinkin' 'bout my next dollar
I'm digging in the game, tryin' to get some money out her
I'm so vain it's a problem
It ain't a stain on these Pradas, I'm just being modest
Got me a goddess, show her how to divide it
She still down... and she don't get none of the profit
Wheel around the city, let the tints hide me
"That's a cold muthafucker, whoever inside it"
Forever symbolizing the grind, it don't walk to you
I make it run like horses do
Giddy up baby, if you got it then hit 'em up baby
I know it's crazy but I can't get enough, baby
I love it I fuckin' love it
I'm a self-made millionaire, fuck the public
Ridin' to myself cause I don't fuck with nothin'
Pistol on my lap on the way to the money
