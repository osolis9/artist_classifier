Ay man, I'm, I'm walkin' on south beach the other day right
You know tha memorial day weekend shit thang
Yeah, so they got a nigga come up to me with a video camera right
And you know muthafuckas come up to me
With cameras everyday so I don't be trippin'

All day everyday you know what I mean?
So you know what this nigga asked me?
"Yo can I battle you on camera?"
I was like dawg how much we gon' make fo' this?
You, you really think, yo, yo

For all you niggas thinkin' y'all could see me and think it's really a game
'Cause I'm from tha south or I don't really be boastin'
And braggin' 'bout that flow and shit
Dawg I got this shit dawg, you niggas think you could fuck
