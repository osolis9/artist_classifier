[Ace Hood]
(Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle,)

[Chorus]
Same old shit, just a different day
out here tryna get it, each and every way
momma need a house
baby need some shoes
times are getting hard
guess what I'mma do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard

[Ace Hood - Verse 1]
Okay, I'm booked out until August
Show money deposits
See the shit then I cop it
got but a house note in my pocket
I'm on south beach with the top off
Bad bitch and her ass soft
Something outta that catalogue
She introduced to that lock jaw
and I think her name was Lisa
Or maybe it was Sheila
My chevy sittin' too high
I call that Wiz Khalifa
And I'm all about the new Franklins
Aint talkin' Aretha
Bitch my league too major
I'm hiphop Derek Jeter
And I'm still feeling my pockets
Big bass and its knocking
Yeah this be the remix
But still ride around with that rocket
I'll go walking back to my household
We The best be the logo
Hundred grand for that neck glow
All about the dinero
N-gga flow so retarded
we be getting gnarley
Oh Kimosabe, it be me, Ross, Weezy party cause its the

Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house
Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what I'mma do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard

Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard

[Lil Wayne]
Ok, now, black card in my pocket
Riding round in that gotti
Pistol off my boxers

Got a big house with a back yard, fish tank with sharks in it

Got a bad bitch who be bartending
Couple homies that gang bang
