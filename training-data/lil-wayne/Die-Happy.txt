You're an accessory to murder cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer

Bang
The shooter name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain
She just screamed 'shoot again'
I gave her extra rounds
My barrell twist around
I am Mr. Shoot-'Em-Down
I leave hearts on the ground
My love is a weapon
And yesIuse it well
ThenIlet the rose petals
Cover up the bullet shell
I never shoot and tell
I only shoot to kill
And that vest ain't gonna help ya
Even if it's made of steel
My love is a revolver
Do you wanna be my target?
Cause i'm a sharp shooter
Matter fact, i'm the sharpest
My aim is so flawless
Girl you could be the farthest
I'mma still shoot my love
Let me know that you caught it
I'm the triggerman I pull it
I will when he wouldn't
Do you wanna eat the bullet
And I know where to put it
It's weezy f. baby
I'm shootin like the army
Girl I should be illegal
Betta put the safety on me
Yeah
