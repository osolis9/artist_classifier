Killer, huh
Calling Lil' Wayne
(Wayne)
A killer
What? What?
Killer
What? What?
Check

Hold up, you now under the deep cover of the lil' slugger
Callin' me head busta, run with me K blucka
Niggas done fled from a, me infrared, sucka
If him wan' play, busta

Bein' a half way out my nappy head
But I don't care, I just grab my clip, slap and spray
Anywhere, it don't matter where a nigga stay
Just believe me when I say, "Guerrilla warfare"

I swear, it be some more drama about these bags
Niggas in black drive Jags, camouflage rags
Niggas' domes get bust wide open with blood and sweat
Niggas ridin' off in hummers, laughin', drinkin' Moette

You know me, Colleon, standin' four feet
I'm totin' cannons, wearin' rolies
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man

See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block
But when me jump out with the chop, chop, my nigga, you drop
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop

Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama
Thuggin' in broad day with four glocks, a knife and a chopper
I'm runnin' away, don't get in my way

My nigga
Calling me head busta
Calling, calling me killer

Them calling me killer
Them calling me head busta, cash money nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts, look out your window, see who in the front?
Me

Them calling me killer
Them calling me head busta, cash money nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts, look out your window, see who in the front

Check, now as the heat flame up
Them lookin'-a down the street
Them think they see Wayne truck
Him whole block don't scare me
'Cause me get me thing and bust

Them know that hot boys known to be dangerous
Now U P T come down, chopper city in the ghetto, my man
Now who that be in the car with the chopper? Oh, it's Lil' Wayne
I get my K, cock, aim and put holes in your brain

Give me that rag, you ain't no soldier
Wipe the blood off my chain, gettin' blisty off in a black F-150
'Bout to do the old usual hit your block, just spittin'
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin'
Respect me for who I be, seventeen, head bustin' because

Them calling me killer
Them calling me head busta, cash cmoney nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts, look out your window, see who in the front?
Me

Them calling me killer
Them calling me head busta, cash money nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts, look out your window, see who in the front

Check, original hot boy, land cruisin' with guns
I shall be the one who burn the block up
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali
Hundred shots automatic, leave ya hopeless in the alley

Now, when a nigga runs up if the nigga loveless
(Like me)
Would have his guns up just because of the simple fact
That I'm a hot boy? And got boys that got toys to stop noise
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty

Now him catch three 'cause him want beef
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, don't mess-a with me
Now look at him - open up his casket and see
Click, clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back

Jump in the black and scream war and just pow, pow
How you love me now? With five barrels to your eye
The scene gets wild and everybody gon' die
What the dillio? Fill a four, four clip

You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip
Who behind the gun slang, blood hang and twistin'?
It's Mister Wayne, come splittin' when I spit

Them calling me killer
Them calling me head busta, cash money nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts, look out your window, see who in the front?
Me

Them calling me killer
Them calling me head busta, cash money nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts, look out your window, see who in the front

Me, see, them calling me killer, huh
Because them calling me killer, what?
Them niggas calling me killer
Them calling me head busta, cash money nigga

What? Calling me killer
