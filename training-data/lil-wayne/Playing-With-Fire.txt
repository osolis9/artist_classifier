So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're drivinâ€~ down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me if I set this stage on fire

Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say no bitch I'm blazin'
Like, what the fuck you expect I'm a motherfuckin' Cajun

And I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doin' time
I goes crazy inside but when it comes out it's fine
Like wine, wait, watch
See I get better with time like a watch

Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch
I Kix it, no cereal like a landing and I sticks it
Wherever she asks me after she licks it

That's too explicit but why you listenin'
I smell smoke and somethin' sizzlin'
That's her pussy, so hey pussy
Play with pussy or play pussy
But you can't blame me if I set this stage on fire

They say you're nobody 'til somebody kills you
But where I'm from you're nobody till you kill somebody
And you know what they say
When you're great it's not murder, it's assassinate

So assassinate me bitch
'Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checkin' in the same hotel, in the same suite bitch
Same balcony, like assassinate me bitch

Swim to him, cheay
I don't rap, I film movies with my rap
You can call me Mr. Directors chair
Yeah and that's a wrap

Cut on to the next
Not the next scene, bitch the next check
Some say the X, makes the sex 'spect's
So play wit' the pussy or play pussy

So you got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're drivin' down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me if I set this stage on fire

Get â€~em, straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart bitch like the Times I'm medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standin' on the corner selling porcelain to people

Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow when I lead you, straight to the needle
The bottles, the battle, the beetles'll eat you

Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat you?
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither

He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither
But you can't blame me if I set this stage on fire
