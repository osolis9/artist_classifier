[Lil Wayne]
uh, yeah,
Lloyds own killer,
she’s my pusha,
she’s my dealer
yeah,
it’s the Lloyds own killer
she’s my pusha,

[Lloyd]
You’re my pusha
Girl you got the World
But I wanna try
Don’t wanna break the rules but I get high off your supply
Don’t make me wait
I’ll do what it takes
Your love is the fix I wanna taste

Her love is like cocaine, cocaine
I’m flying on a private plane,
And I’m so high (so high, so high, I sail in the sky)
Cobain, Cobain
She blows my brain
I’m trippin’, I’m rollin’
I’m losing all control cause…

[Chorus]
She’s my pusha, pusha
She’s my pusha, pusha
Girl she’s my pusha, pusha
Pusha, pusha

She gon’ make me push it
Push our love
She gon’ make me push it
Push our love
She gon’ make me push it
Push our love
She gon’ make me push it
Push our love

I’m lifted baby
Your love is ecstasy
Every time I’m wit ya baby
I relapse and I OD
I’m addicted to you
Keep coming back for more
Never took a trip like this before

Her love is like cocaine, cocaine
I’m flying on a private plane,
And I’m so high (so high, so high, I sail in the sky)
Cobain, Cobain
She blows my brain
I’m trippin’, I’m rollin’
I’m losing all control cause…

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
And this is your Wayne on drugs,

[Lloyd]
She’s my pusha, pusha

Pusha, pusha
