[Intro]
My name is
My name is
My name is:
Weezy Baby
And I'm high, like maintenance
I'm smokin, I'm drankin
Leanin daily, like
Hi, my name is
You know what my name is
Bitch, I'm famous
Like Tom Brady
And hi, your name is?
Not important
Who cares?
Not Weezy Baby, uh

[Verse 1]
Wake up, I see bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
Makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch
Without no makeup I see that bitch as just average
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi!
Looking at my rollie, I got boogers on my rollie
Bout to hook up with my whoadies
Got the hook up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka I'm reloading
And according to my darling
This dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty
She so naughty, me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony
Break it down to rice-a-roni
Take her out, look like she lonely
I'm gonna candle, light the moment
I'm a fan, I like the pussy
She told him my phone was roamin'
She be moaning to the morning
I be goin in, I be on it
I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill
And I got doorman at the entrance
They got pistols in they trenches
They got rituals/religion
And I'm like bitch you know I'm sipping till I die

[Hook 1]
My name is:
Lil Wayne, bitch
Weezy, F. Baby
Her name went
From whatever-it-was
To "Lil Wayne's bitch"
Now that's crazy, and I
I camed in, regain strength
Rebanged it, rotation
Her guy is nameless
He ain't shit
Always on the same shit
Poor baby

[Verse 2]
I pour up so much they call me Pour Baby
Kush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barr baby
Sip got me moving slow but my thoughts racing
Err!
My long days give me short patience
My heart vacant
Awards taken
What in tarnation
No information
No statements
Young mula, old mula; mula all ages
Ha-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac
Roc-a-fella, new rock
Hundred K in a shoebox
AK and a new Glock
A-wap-ba-ba-loo-bop
Pray the vest you got
Save you like a coupon
Hustle til my dreadlock
Is grey as some Poupon
Everyday is my birthday, I'm a newborn
Stay on my toes, ask a shoe horn
I ain't got no roof on
Gettin' my No Ceilings 2 on

[Hook 2]
And hi, I'm brainless
I'm stainless
Entertainment:
His lady
And um, if she ain't thick
Then she ain't it
I can't fuck with a slim lady
I tried, superhead
Keep complainin
Bitch ancient
Bitch shady, and she tired
Okay then, I'm skatin
Doing tricks, call me 'trick Swayze
Okay

[Verse 3]
In other news, in other niggas' hoes
Your wife taste like honey nut cheerios
I'm in the mirror, like "Ooh baby"
Who needs a miracle when I got you baby?
Pimping in my last life
I'm the shit you ass-wipe
Beat the pussy-cat-fight
My teeth look like a flashlight
Weed is like a airline
Cause easily I'm that high
Fist full of money, mix some green in with your black eye
Greedy like a fat guy, I eat a nigga franchise
I beat him by a landslide
A leader like a rabbi
I'm leading by halftime
He bleeding, I'm a vampire
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my Alpines
We the niggas, that's right
We all that and fries
Y'all on standby
My broads got cat eyes
Traphouse, land lines
Boom like land mines
All my bitches allies
With Tune on their backsides

[Hook 3]
So hi, my name is
On her anus
On her cranium
Bitch cravin'
And I'm fly, and I'm wavy
And her name is bust-it-baby
And hi, my name is
In your mouth, it must be tasty
Gone
