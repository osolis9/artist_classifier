[** feat. Gorillaz:]


... I'm a killer, Snoopy... Gorillaz*
Slaying low on the floor, my hands are...
I'm full of dough!
Roomies try to kiss me slow,
I'm leaning like a sixty...
This life I lead is incredible,
These trees I breath are medical.
Take a look in my eyes,
Hold on tight, enjoy the ride!
If you don't feel good, then you're out of place,
My universe is out of space,
My look, my style, my product case.
Low daddy get...
Strip this, hit... now sit back, and let dough get on that!
Party people you get naughty!

[Chorus:]
Have you ever tried sumething like this night?
I could try and smoke with you sumething like this night?
Have you ever tried sumething like this night?
I could try and smoke with you sumething like this night?
Sumething like this nigh, sumething like this night!
Sumething like this night, sumething like this night!

What a night to get involved,

Everybody have a pause!
Celebrate and fill your cup,
Drink until you get enough!
How you feel, I got that feeling, this go...
Ain't nobody on the wall,
I could drop it and let it fall!
Hey DJ, play my song!
Step back, let it bang all night long!
I need your attention!
No hoping or wishing!
Come in and... permission!
Said I do, right there I do,
Get up and get money,..
Rode it, ride it, lick it,
Bite it, roll it, ride it!
Party people...

[Chorus:]
Have you ever tried sumething like this night?
I could try and smoke with you sumething like this night?
Have you ever tried sumething like this night?
I could try and smoke with you sumething like this night?
Sumething like this nigh, sumething like this night!
Sumething like this night, sumething like this night!
