Hustlers on the block, buster's gettin' shot
Playa haters jock and pray that they got cop 'cuz

Quick cash pimpin', swift ass kickin's

Don't get quiet, niggas start a riot
Take off like hollies, young gangsta try it
In it for the highs, you can't deny it, man

Suckas gettin' played, player bitches gettin' paid
Said gangster everyday, place the snitches in their grave

(Everywhere I go)

Packed up cells, dirty-ass jails
Sneaky ass snails, hot like Hell

Banned X boxes and yoke gettin' shopped
Stacks gettin' clocked and 'Lacs gettin' dropped

Takin' some ecstasy, want some sex from me

Cars full of sets, marks gettin' checked
Hard niggas vets, bullets scars on they chest
Start tryna test, I hope the Lord got ya blessed, nigga

Ain't a motherfuckin' thang changed, you know what I'm sayin', man?

Make this motherfucker jump, let the bitches get crunk
I got a room at the Trump, later on we can slump
Let the speakers thump and watch these hoes thump 'cuz

Niggas serve zones, niggas swerve chrome
Bitches turn wrong, get other bitches turned me on
Think it ain't sold then ya musta heard it wrong

Bailin' through the streets, always catch me with some heat
On my way to buck a freak, back up we fuck the heat
In and out of sheets while ya ass be asleep 'cuz

My hand on the tech or the magnum on deck
You ain't gotta guess, I represent it to the death, nigga
