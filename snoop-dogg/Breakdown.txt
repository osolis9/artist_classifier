You found the soilder
But Im a man in a peace
I fight for your love
They try to take it from me
Then protect your heart so you never be hurt again
But its a sacrifice cause Im an a old fashion working man
Which means I wont be home like I used to
On the phone like I used to
Wont be long for i see you too
Yeah
We live life with no fears
And you never disappear, you showed me how much you care
I was never insecure, I love the fact you let me live
When you held me down for years
The hardest part for me out here its when you cry
Im not there to wipe your tears
So baby dont breakdown, on me now, I need your love too
Make it back home, I dont know how I'll do without you
So baby dont breakdown on me now, I need your love too
Make it back home, I dont know how Ill do with out you
With out you, Ill do with out you
With out you, Ill do with out you
With out you, Ill do with out you
With out you
Cant do with out your love, your love, your love
Cant do with out your love
I know you hear the rumors, I know you hear the lies
I know you hear that Im no different from all these other guys
I wanna come home sooner
To make you realize, that lifes a contest and you happen to be my prize
Yeah
We live life with no fears
And you never disappear, you showed me how much you care
I was never insecure, I love the fact you let me live
Then you help me down for years
The hardest part for me out here is when you cry
Im not there to wipe your tears
So baby dont breakdown, hold me now, I need your love too
Make it back all, I dont know how Ill do with out you
So baby dont breakdown over now, I need your love too
Make it back all, I dont know how Ill do with out you
