Somethin' to crack the New Year off, you dig?

One for the treble, two for the bass
Come on everybody, let's rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass
Come on everybody, let's rock this place

Doggy Dogg, you are the best
Rock this beat 'cause you are so fresh

Well, if you insist her, I guess I'll twist her
But, give me a minute while I freak your sista
Push the pista up against her
No offense, but this pimpin' mista

Bow your fist up or hold your cris up
Light that bitch up and blow your sist up
This that shit to get your jive talkin'
East Side RTC walkin'

People, people listen closely
I say it 'cause mostly when y'all approach me
Stay low key and keep it OG
And don't try to burn rubber on me

I loved your movies you are awesome Snoop

My daughter loves you, she's only two

You a handsome fella, you're kinda cute
I really wanna get witchu

Doggy Dogg, you are the best
Rock this beat 'cause you are so fresh
Doggy Dogg, you are the best
Take this shit back home to the West

Melissa Brista in San Francisca
The cute little sista with the feet for blista
Say that I dissed her 'cause I wouldn't kiss her
But I got her a picture and said, "I'll holla back witcha"

Hey, they say that I'm like Mr. Bigsta
All these bullshit moves to miss us
Divide in twisters we buy relistas
We mind my listnats 'cause I'm a mimsta

Design by mimstas these time are senistas
But I'ma finish her on the ground until it's done
Knives and silly clubs, hoes and fake thugs
Pimps, players and all of the above

Oh, were was I? Oh yes, spittin' to flip ya
Comin' thru scriptures, straight your ditchas
Pigs won't pinch us, won't just miss us
And they wanna French kiss us

Pack the pistas, twist don't twist us
Roll with me on this dog adventure
But you can't enter without your credentias
And if you get in, you might get a picture

So sit your shit down, go on and get down
It's huggy baby, it's comin' in your town
You don't wanna miss this, it's just like Christmas
So make your wish list and go on and flicc this
