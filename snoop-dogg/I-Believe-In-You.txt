I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you
This love's exactly how I picture
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you
We're flowing smooth just like a river

Express my true when, I make love to you
Just like that day back in September
If we might run in some problems
I know you'll see me through

There's nothing for you I won't do
'Cause I believe in you
Oh, I believe in you

And I believe in you too
See can't nobody make me do what you do
I mean, I'm so in love with you
I never thought a girl could make me

Take me to a whole new world
Re-shape me, love me, hate me
Lately, we ain't been fussing or fighting
You play all day and I be working at night and

The only one who understands my life
And the cake and the icing
These other girls in the world
Live their life so trifling

I couldn't do it no more
I had to sit you down
And make you my wife and cold thing
But you know, it's a cold gain

It's so real
I had to bless you with my last name
Slowed me down
Straight took me out the fast lane

Hold me down, come on baby
Watch me do this thing
I been crowned king
So I guess that means you're my queen

You have my seeds
Let's go ahead and raise this team
It's so special
You're all I ever need

I'm feeling good and my baby's home
You're spending time, holding hands to this beat
The fellow that can satisfy my every need
Is he the one?

We've been around and we're both grown
Look at me, I'm like a baby, I took that chance
And I feel secure about this love romance
Let's have some fun

And I believe when you say
Ain't that special, touch my soul, feel the same
When you whisper softly and call my name
Here I come

It's more than words that I ever could sing
You're that chill bring
Maybe your walk or just the way you do me
I really think we are the two 'cause I believe in you

Take a second realize we can make it if you
Don't stop, come on boy we about to take it to the top
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see
Do you believe in me?

We can make it all nite long, baby if we don't stop
Come on boy you know you got me so hot
I know I'm gonna love what you're about to do
'Cause I believe in you, I believe in you

And I believe in you too
'Cause it's the right thing to do
And I believe in you too
'Cause it's the only thing to do

I couldn't give you away
No matter what my friends sizzay
See when I'm gone away from home
I'm alone every dizzay

I left a gang of messages for you
On your two way
But you ain't hollered back
But you know how, you play

You say, "Okay", I say, "No way"
We got to be together forever
And a dizzay
'Cause I believe in you

Take a second realize we can make it if we
Don't stop, come on boy we about to take it to the top
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see
Do you believe in me?

We can make it all nite long, baby if we don't stop
Come on boy you know you got me so hot
I know I'm gone love what you're about to do
'Cause I believe in you

I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you
This love's exactly how I picture
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you
We're flowing smooth just like a river

Express my true when, I make love to you
Just like that day back in September
If we might run in some problems
I know you'll see me through

There's nothing for you I won't do
'Cause I believe in you
Oh, I believe in you
