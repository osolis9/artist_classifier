I went to my closet then I put my robe on
Slip into the living room then I turn the stove on
I am half necked so I put my clothes on
Smashed .. but I get my roll on
Getting matches they get my toke on
Yes indeed now ride get my .. on
Saw it popping it don’t quit here we go again another hit
Fifteen-hundred, I got you stunned I am blunted, I am like Stevie Wonder
Yeah indeed its the S you know me the king of the West with nothing
But the purple in my chest this one is for my niggers .. you dig it
I do this off the .. ain’t no need for me to write it see I am the tightest
I am like nigga in encyclopedia collide this listen to me you know I park it up
Is Snoop DO double G now gonna chuck it up
Ego tripping .. seven got the bitches tripping
You know it's cracking I am back in action
Have a smoke let us roll
If a rhyme making my time making …
Girl I came I am chasing .. hard to ..
Give a little .. you got to know
..stay in pain thought I am in the game
But I really wanna be with you

What is was what are you smoking what up dog
I am on the block with my nephews..
Paying dues, new tennis shoes
Brand new car feeling good
How are you living dog? Still in the hood

Pigs want me, so do these hoes
So I gots to skip towns and do these shows
I got money but I need more every day I don’t know
Which way Ima go
But Ima run, instead of walking
Still gangster, still Crip walking
Still talking shit still doing me Snoop DO double G
You see me I am the .. in the yellow yellow
Six clock in the morning .. shower ain’t hot
I have been thinking about growing
To the east side East side
To the east side East side
But I really wanna be with you
If I was you and you was me nigga ..
You will never be DO double G that is what they are telling me
That is what they are selling me ..- watch the big nut watch the big Ben
.. go ahead dog .. talk to a nigga let us go to the .. me and you babe
That is lunch gangster shit from a gangster grip ..
Girl I came I am chasing .. hard to ..
Give a little .. you got to know
..stay in pain thought I am in the game
But I really wanna be with you
Six clock in the morning .. shower ain’t hot
I have been thinking about growing
To the east side East side
To the east side East side
But I really wanna be with you
