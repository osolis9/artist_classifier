The high rolla give me the pistola and about half a key thats some coca-cola
Not that I got older, I got alittle colda , and I don't trip to get a chip
off ma shoulder. Mad dreams of a gangster, making like caggney a boggie, but
Snoop Doggy ain't no follower man I'm a general. So, when I put it down I gots
to be so original. I'm quick ta bust just like Daz Dilinger but thats the
little homey, and I'm the big homey Snoop Dog, Holy Oly. Spit, Hittin. While
I'm gettin at it, bout it bout it, and I'm happy to shout it. I disappear
before the games get crowded take a trip over seas to west Indies. FREEZE!
JD, Uh-Huh!
I get goosebump when the baseline pumps, so phat call me proffessor clump.
Aint nothing to know about me. I floss, no its none of these (echo)
From which I'd toss. Wanna track that'd bring chicks 'cause I cost a million
dollar company and I'm the boss. I'm gonna sit back and watch out, go for it,
when the color drops on the car port. ('Coo Sure)

Cackies on ma legs, lugs on ma feet. I'm walking up the street while bompin ma
feet. I'm fresh off the bus from Memphis Tennesee, head stil spinnin from the
coke in henesee. Sit down on it, nah, get down on it. It really don't matter
'cause you wan't it, dog gone it.
Cuz you messed wit buz, when you was bumpin your gums. so you thought it was.
But look, I ain't been trippin right, left. Its like that there. Bam, Wam. So
many styles, I could flip 'em like a bow.
Pop ma drop top, let the beat rock.
Of course you do, miss you, were back to the issue, I wish you, stop trying
ta clam the paydown
Cause you don't really wanna get down.
