To the Bat mobile, let's go
Atomic batteries to power
Turbines to speed
Roger, ready to move out

No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
No one, can save the day like Batman

Commissioner X here
Batman & Robin, we have a bit of a problem
There's trouble brewin' in Gotham City
You must act fast

Holy mackerel Batman, I think these clowns
Need to back down
Let's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em
And make 'em scat man

When you say scat man, like the brother called brother
When it's on, it's cold, so bring thener cover
We can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger
Go get The Riddler, to watch me play that nigga like a fiddler

On a hot tin roof, I got them watchin' who?
She who spits it like she was sippin' rotten brew, ooh
We Marvel at you Comics, you ain't no Superhero
You just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro

Surprise, The Dynamic Duo
Batman & Robin, gats set for squabbin', nigga
Splat, hit 'em like forty-five shells, nigga
Plat, means more than one million sales

That's nuff shot to lick, you get done up
Plus we got the Bat gats
So why would you run up?

Batman, Batman, Batman
And you're about to find out

No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
No one, can save the day like Batman

And you're about to find out

Yeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and
Hit 'em with the, whoa
Pick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace
When I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face

Robin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest
They wanna go head up and collide
And like collision, hope your moms made provisions
See you ain't got no wins baby, not even a smidgen

Mad hostility dealt, now I'ma really be felt
Switch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt
I go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter
Get, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder
So the, sayin' goes, if you snooze you lose
Trust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two

No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime
No one, can save the day like Batman

Cold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin'
Catnip for Catwoman so she caught the feelin'
Huh, talk about flavor for a Pringle
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle
Damn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin'
They hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing

Batman, war is on the brink
It seems that the Penguin is causin' a stink
Call up Robin quick, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the town blue

Shit I'm there in a flash, Bat mobile on 3's
Trust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze
And Clayface will catch the embrace
Of napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb
And don't you forget it
Takin' out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime

No one, can save the day like Batman
Robin, will make you sway like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fightin' crime

Dirty Dinkins Batman
Did you see those crispy khaki creases
On that rugged wretched
Aiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin

Get Alfred and tell him to have
Barbecued buffalo wings
And a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill
It's about to get real in the field

Leapin' Lo-lo's
Over there Batman
That's a no-no
Let's hop out this fo'-do'

Yea, yea, yea, systems engaged
Start the Bat Engine
Hit the Bat Switches
You ready Robin? Let's dip

Let's, dip, Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin' crack in the alley
Let's, dip, I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman
We must, we must Batman, listen to me
Holy Leapin' Lizards and Gizzards

And all that shit that come with it
And potatoes on top with gravy in the middle
Goddamnit Batman

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da--da-da-dah
Batman
