'Bout to make the night shine
Snoop
Kellz
Platinum through the doors

V12 rolling, nigga goin' platinum
V12 rolling, nigga goin' platinum
V12 rolling, nigga goin' platinum
V12 rolling, nigga goin' platinum

Swag like a lighter and I keep my swag lit
Man, I'm on fire, that can't tell a nigga shit
V12 rolling, got some honeys up in it
Say your pussy golden but I only fuck with platinum chicks

Only talk platinum shit, only swallow platinum spit
Speak my own slanguage, still I am the real-iest
Surrounded by Croc but your boy sipping Hennessy
Loves is a hospital and I was born in V.I.P.

Sick and there's no cure, bad case of V.I.P.
Still in the game killing, you can call us M.V.P
Whole fucking club, jump in your cars and follow me
It's dude from the Chi and the D-O double G

We platinum, platinum stars
Platinum, platinum chicks
Platinum, platinum clothes
Platinum, platinum rich

Platinum, platinum shots
Platinum, platinum flights
Platinum, platinum cribs
Platinum, platinum lights

Let a motherfucker know from the get go
Came through the door slow with a four-four
Limping, crimping and pimping, mixing 'em all
Fixing the ball, drifting, listen, dawg

My rap is that my Cadillac is dripping wet
You can bet, turn it down, roll it up, burn it up
Give it back to me, let me show you how to move that
Groove that, weed that do that
All in fallin' ballin' yellin' doggy do that chew that

Record sales, whole sales, detail, retail, you fail, we sell
Ding dong, get your mama, ring your bell
Back in the club with my nephew Kellz

25 girls in the Dogg cartel
And they do what the Dogg say
Grifted or walkway, pimping on them all day, can't you tell?

I'm liking it, loving it, cubbin' it
Gubbin' it, drinks up, blunts lit, platinum boss shit
Nigga, you know how we do this

Platinum, platinum stars
Platinum, platinum chicks
Platinum, platinum clothes
Platinum, platinum rich

Platinum, platinum shots
Platinum, platinum flights
Platinum, platinum cribs
Platinum, platinum lights

Take it back in the back of the car, mac
Mac like mackin' 'em hard like dat corps crackin' 'em hard
Rich nigga with a platinum card, in a platinum car
With mink on the seat, bones on the feet, ho's on the street

'Cause they all wanna make that trip to the promised land
Little mama can give it to me like I'm the man
Give it to me like I told you
Grab you, flip you, hold you, break you down

Stop the press, drop your dress 'cause I'm gon' take you down
What d'you think? I got drink and you won't drink right now?
Two shots and now you ready for that, that, that now

And I'm gon' give you that, I know that you diggin' that
Platinum smile on your face, yeah, they know I'm diggin' that
And I'm liking it, loving it, cubbin' it, gubbin' it
Drinks up, blunts lit, platinum boss shit
You know how we do this

Platinum, platinum stars
Platinum, platinum chicks
Platinum, platinum clothes
Platinum, platinum rich

Platinum, platinum shots
Platinum, platinum flights
Platinum, platinum cribs
Platinum, platinum lights

Look at us mom, we at the bar, we going crazy, whoa
Earth is our turf, we on them jets leaving them haters, whoa
Snoop poppin' bottles, I got models 'bout to mix it, whoa
I see your man, he causing problems, 'bout to fix it, whoa

You cats are sloppy, call me the clean up man
Pimpin' is my hobby, first love mic in hand
I got a platinum car, I got a platinum chain
I got a platinum chick and she give me platinum brain

I ain't gonna bullshit ya ladies
This the real thing
While they going gold
Weed 'em with platinum man

Platinum, platinum stars
Platinum, platinum chicks
Platinum, platinum clothes
Platinum, platinum rich

Platinum, platinum shots
Platinum, platinum flights
Platinum, platinum cribs
Platinum, platinum lights
