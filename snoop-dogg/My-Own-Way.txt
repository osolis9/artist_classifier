Bank accounts, big cars
Livin' good like a movie star
My mama house ain't in the hood no more
I moved her out to Saint [Incomprehensible] Port

But it's a trip though 'cause I'm between the crib though
I gotta lay it low, my homies wanna do low
I got two strikes and I'mma get my third
These niggers snitchin' on me, they think I am sellin' birds

So when I'm in the streets, I'm quick on my feet
See, talk is cheap so I stay put on my heat
You niggers bad, well, Dogg is badder
Rad attack make you niggers scared

I won't shut up, your boy want me now
Once at the station, that nigger straight point me out
So I'mma lay it while you spray it, while you spray your weight
As at this time, I think it's best I just to stay away

They say I'm a fool
'Cause I like to do my thing my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me
One more and I'm on my way

I ain't got time to hang around the hood
Like I used to do, I gotta get my bread
Keep my head
See that all the children get this money instead

Separate, elevate
Concentrate, dominate and innovate
Try to be fly as me
And every other homie tell a lie to me

I need a deal, I need some stones
I need some beats, Dogg, I need a loan
Help me out, throw me some cash
If I got it, you got it and you ain't gotta ask

But on the real or is it lately
A lot of homies, they try to implicate me
They say I changed, is it the fame?
If I throw it to you, they charge it to the game

Money falling, overload
In the hood, another episode
Man, I'm gettin' old, the game cold
Yeah, I'm from the dirt, that ain't high road

They say I'm a fool
'Cause I like to do my thing my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me
One more and I'm on my way

I ain't got time to hang around the hood
Like I used to do, I gotta get my bread
Keep my head
See that all the children get this money instead
