Let cho' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk, nigga take my shoes
New fools, you fools, these fools, all y'all
Talkin' bad about me and my motherfuckin' dawg

He ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', but y'all niggaz still dissin'
To me some of these suckers'll never get it
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip and
Dogg House in your mouth, now tell me how you livin'

Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is 'The Villain'
My homey from the CPT, cold chillin'
Now as time flies by I see the game gettin' mo' reala
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it? I always tend to come widdit

Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it
I'm too young to retire, I'm havin' fun wit it
See when you learn what to do with it
I'll be done with it, come with it

Go, just go away, go away
Niggaz can't be trusted, just come back another day
Niggaz be on bitch shit, just go far away
Niggaz get it twisted, just go away

Now she said, she don't like a G
Well, listen here bitch, get the fuck from 'round me
You thought, you was 'bout to get a drink on me?
I put hands on you bitch like 'Suga Free'

I always let a bitch know her boundaries
Same with a nigga, I treat him like a flea
You claim to be, you aim to be in my spot
Motherfucker, you will get popped

Not knowin' who you fuckin' wit, niggaz be on bitch shit
Nigga, we be fuckin' quick, nigga we ain't talkin' shit
When the heat's spit, niggaz be on bitch shit
Tryin' to get somewhere, coverin' up they biscuit

And then he in the club, all up on my dilznick
But when I leave, you niggaz pullin' trick shit
But it's cool, 'cause niggaz gonna miss this
'Cause I'ma keep it all business, what is this?

Go, just go away, go away
Niggaz can't be trusted, just come back another day
Niggaz be on bitch shit, just go far away
Niggaz get it twisted, go away

I said, let yo' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk, nigga take my shoes
You fools, these fools, new fools, all y'all
Talkin' bad about me and my motherfuckin' dawg

He ain't trippin', I ain't trippin' but y'all niggaz still dissin'
Look here bitch, some of these niggaz'll never get it
Full clip and if I miss it I'ma tip it on the Crip and
Dogg House in your mouth, now tell me how you livin'

Who the villain, you the villain? Nigga Ren is 'The Villain'
My homey from the CPT, cold chillin'
Now as time fly I see the game gettin' mo' reala
As I get mo' scrilla, can you dig it? I always tend to come widdit

Gravy train on your brain, nigga come get it
Too young to retire, I'm havin' fun wit it
When you learn what to do with it
I'll be done with it, come with it

Go, just go away, go away
Niggaz can't be trusted, just come back another day
Niggaz be on bitch shit, just go far away
Niggaz get it twisted, go away

Yeah, I'm bout to go far away
So far you might not see me
My nigga, Meech on the beat
We takin' over this motherfucker, ha ha

And they thought we fell off, fell all up in your motherfuckin' ass
Bitch, Kokane, aw, that's funky right there
Puttin' it back on the map, uh, let me hear some dawg
Ah, as we take your mind to a dimension you never thought existed

Go, just go away, go away
Niggaz can't be trusted, just come back another day
Niggaz be on bitch shit, just go far away
Niggaz get it twisted, go away

Go away, go away, just come back another day
