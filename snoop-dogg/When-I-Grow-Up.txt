The Dogg Pound and the LBC
Your baby is waiting for you
That's that damn Snoop Dogg again
He ain't nothin' but a fuckin' pimp

Man Snoop you got a bad car
When I grow up I wanna be just like you
Look here little homeboy, let me tell you somethin'
Don't never let me hear you say
You wanna be like me

You could be a doctor, a lawyer
A football player, a Laker, anything
Just don't never let me hear you say
You want to be like me
You hear me? Yeah huh

Now take these dollars and go give 'em
To your brothers and sisters
And you run on to school
Thanks Snoop
