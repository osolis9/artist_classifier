I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you
This love's exactly how I picture
(How I picture)
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you
We're flowing smooth just like a river
(Like a river)
Express my true, when, I make love to you
(To you)

Just like that day back in September
If we might run in some problems
I know you'll see me through
There's nothing for you I won't do
('Cause I believe in you)
You
(Oh, I believe in you)
You

And I believe in you too
See can't nobody make me do what you do
I mean I'm so in love with you
I never thought a girl could make me
Take me to a whole new world
Re-shape me, love me, hate me

Lately, we ain't been fussing or fighting
You play all day and I be working at night and
The only one who understands my life and
The cake in the icing
These other girls in the world
Live their life so trifling

I couldn't do it no more, I had to sit you down
And make you my wife and cold thing
But you know it's a cold gain
(Goal gain)
It's so real, I had to bless you with my last name
(Last name)
Slowed me down, straight took me out the fast lane
(Fast lane)

Hold me down, come on, baby
Watch me do this thing
(Do it)
I been crowned king
So, I guess that means you're my queen
You have my seeds let's go ahead and raise this team
It's so special, you're all I ever need

I'm feeling good and my baby's home
You're spending time holding hands
  (Time)
To this beat the fellow that can satisfy my every need
Is he the one?

We've been around and we're both grown
(Grown)
Look at me
(Me)
I'm like a baby, I took that chance
And I feel secure about this love romance
Let's have some fun and I believe when you say

Ain't that special, touch my soul
(Soul)
Feel the same when you whisper softly
And call my name, here I come
It's more than words that I ever could sing
You're that chill bring
(Maybe your walk or just the way you do me)
I really think we are the two 'cause I believe in you

Take a second realize we can make it if you
Don't stop,  come on boy we about to take it to the top
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see
(Do you believe in me?)
We can make it all night long, baby if we
Don't stop, come on boy you know you got me so hot
I know I'm gonna love what you're about to do
('Cause I believe in you, I believe in you)

And I believe in you too
'Cause this the right thing to do
And I believe in you too
'Cause this the only thing to do
I couldn't give you away
No matter what my friends sizzay

See when I'm gone away from home
I'm alone every dizzay
I left a gang of messages for you
On your two way
But you ain't hollered back
But you know how, you play

You say, okay
I say, no way
We got to be together forever
And a dizzay
'Cause I believe in you

Take a second realize we can make it if we
Don't stop come on boy we about to take it to the top
I know you're gonna love what you're about to see
(Do you believe in me?)
We can make it all night long, baby if we
Don't stop, come on boy you know you got me so hot
I know I'm gone love what you're about to do
('Cause I believe in you)

I'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you
  (I believe in you)
This love's exactly how I picture
(How I picture)
It's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you
We're flowing smooth just like a river
(Like a river)
Express my true, when, I make love to you
(To you)

Just like that day back in September
If we might run in some problems
I know you'll see me through
There's nothing for you I won't do
('Cause I believe in you)
