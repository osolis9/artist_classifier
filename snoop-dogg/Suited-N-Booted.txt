That's short Jay
Gators on your feet, six piece outfit
Hat to the side, four bitches on your arm

I keep my glass in my hand
In case I want to get my drink on
Feelin' way pimpin', should I put the white mink on?
You got to do it, suited n booted
Me an' my niggas stay suited n booted

Game is tight, I'ma put this gold link on
Feelin' way pimpin'
Should I put the blue mink on?
You got to do it, suited n booted
Me an' my niggas stay suited n booted

What you think we toastin' for?
Me an' my nephews, west coast for sho'
We keep the best of Indigo
We count our blessings, give thanks an' then we blow

I'll say it again, I know I've said it before
Why Snoop be lettin' his mink drag on the floor
That's pimp shit, somethin' you wouldn't know
G'd up from the feet up, layin' low

Game on lock, that's why I got this link on
Feelin' way pimpin', should I put the green mink on?
You got to do it, suited n booted
I got to do it, suited n booted

I keep my glass in my hand
In case I want to get my drink on
Snoop Dogg clothing with a light pink mink on
You got to do it, suited n booted
Me an' my niggas stay suited n booted

Mayre Gators, Maylike boots
Seven piece custom made suits
Hats to match, countin' my chicken scratch
Just cut a deal with Cadillac

Fo' real, that's why I be dressed to kill
Sixty five G's for a Snoop Deville
Get you one, matter 'fact, get two
They come in Burgundy but I'ma paint mine blue

I can't come through half steppin'
I keep me a cane as a potential weapon
Slap a bitch or beat a nigga up too
I do what the fuck I want to do

I stay cool, act the fool, represented
Hard from the get go, so hard to the finish
The cleanest, the meanest, I know that's right
An' don't get to close 'cause these gators bite

Game is lock that's why I got this link on
Feelin' way pimpin', should I put the orange mink on?
You got to do it, suited n booted
I got to do it, suited n booted

I keep my glass in my hand
In case I want to get my drink on
Snoop Dogg clothin' with a honey brown mink on
You got to do it, suited n booted
Me an' my niggas stay suited n booted

Yeah, suited n booted, baby
Lemme add somethin' up for you real quick
Fifteen hundred dollar gators, six thousand dollar suit
Twelve-hundred dollar hat
My muthafuckin' glass cost eight-hundred dollars

An' the Snoop Deville I just jumped out of
That's sixty five G's
Plus the ounce that I got in my pocket
Add me up, nigga, that's a hundred somethin' thousand
Motherfucker, can you buy that?

That's called bein' suited n booted
G'd up from the feet up, can you dig it?
An' we do this here like seven dizzles a wizzle
Fa shizzle, my nizzle, the big Snoopy D O double jizzle
Back up in the hizzle, Da Bo$$, nigga
