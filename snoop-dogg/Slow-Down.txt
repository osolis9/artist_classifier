Slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down

Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Life ain't nothin' but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smokin'
I'm doin' that just to reminisce
It's funny on how shit be

A lot of money, make y'll wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes

And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas

Nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap
And when we get to spittin' make sure y'll step back
You with that? 'Cause if you ain't clown
We from the D O double G, we groupie true and slow down

Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Ayyo Snoop, I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for the jail house visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga

Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shoppin', hit the club and then
Never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age but they call me Mama

Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slangin' with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'll, for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I

Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord
Please change my ways 'cause I'm livin' too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down

Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started puttin' all this game on records for my come up
From sun up to sun down, I'm tryin' to get my money
Hata's ain't gon' stop me 'cause hatas can't run me

It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Every body seemed glad but now they mad
'Cause I'm flossin', boss ballin' guilt free
And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun
I [Incomprehensible] from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the nineties and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump

You don't wanna get caught up in my mix
'Cause I'm a soldier, blastin' at the rollers, bitch
We don't neva eva, talk no shit
Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit

Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Slow down 'cause I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Slow down, slow down
Slow your roll tuck your heat
And watch the hatas
