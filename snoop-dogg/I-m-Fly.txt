"Welcome to tha Church: Volume II"
Exclusive 213
(uh hah hah, uh hah hah)
Got my nephew Nate Dogg in da house
Nate Dogg holla at 'em
Where you at?
Ridin in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying for (Why?)
Cuz I'm fly
Yeah he super sly
NATE DOGG!
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yaaaa
You know he supa sly
But me I'm supa dupa and I'm supa dupa fly
I'd be the great at this I know you waited this
And I wanted this to be elaborate and so strenuous
And then you just slide by and wiz-ave
You on another piz-age
Is that the way you gon be-hiz-ave?
I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a playa?
Let me help out your pride
I'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a physchologist
A shrink... on a freak
Peep (my) my technique
And I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the rip that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot
Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC and I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too
I'm a real pimp playa from the 213 crew
Now look here boo
If you gonna bang or hang with tha dogg
You best to get in
Holla at her Nate Dogg (Holla, holla)
Ridin in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
You were reaching for stars (umm)
I just want me something natural (Is that right Nate Dogg?)
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as (Check this out) if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home (Damn nigga)
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying fo' (Why?)
(What she cryin for?)
Cuz I'm fly
Yeah he super sly
NATE DOGG! (Yeah)
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yaaaa
Warren G.
3 piece with a mink
Gotta think my shit stinks
Stacy Adams with a drink
Pockets pad up, they come from Brinks
So what the ladies wink
You the one in the Mercedes
Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin watchin "The Lion King"
Crying and thangs
Cus I'm with Snoop and Nate, singing, rhyming and things
I'm out late cus I'm rhyming for change
I ain't with dime for dames
Hop back and I'm trying to aim.
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulatin, been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game
Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for da riddles
You know these bars
Everywhere we go... you know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagne caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you.
And I laugh
Ridin in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying fo' (Why?)
Cuz I'm fly
Yeah he super sly (super fly)
NATE DOGG!
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yaaaa
