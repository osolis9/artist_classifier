As I take another choken toke of icky sticky stanky
Stuff a bull, pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint
Lean back and puff slow

Whenever I'm makin' a record, I'm gettin' into my character
And I'm tryin' to portray somethin' that I'm feelin'
So that the whole world can believe in it

Do anybody know my name, what's my name? Snoop Dogg
What's my name? Snoop Dogg
Hold on, I want y'all to say my name like dis
Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snoop, Snoop

There are seven wonders in the world
You're about to witness the eighth
Nigga ask about me, nigga ask about me
You don't believe me? Motherfucker, say what?
Aiyyo Cat, roll out the blue carpet, cuzz
Lemme C-walk on these niggaz

Blue hat, blue socks, blue shoes, too cool
Blue car, blue house, blue pit, blue pool
Blue grass, blue Coupe, blue b-ball hoop
What kind of phone you on, loc? I'm on the blue too

Talkin' to my nephew, my nigga Boo, half who?
He make pimpin' on a bitch look so cool
Old school, old fools, steel on a nigga first
Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a nigga's shirt

Do it to it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad
Snoopy D O dub, they can't touch yo' swag
Oh mark ass niggas, better tuck yo' flag
'Cause when my music out loco, I come to smash yo' ass

Fuck him, fuck her and fuck all y'all too
He wants everything to be right 'cause I'm Snoop Dogg
I'm so hood, so true
And every time that you see me cuzz, I'm oh so blue

To get that you have to stay on top of your game
And learn the most specific lesson
That shit is dope right there, God
