Don't Do The Crime (aka Death Row Killaz)



[Chorus, Snoop singing]
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Yeah
Don't do it

Fell off into a party in the CPT
Niggas looking at me strange
But I'm up on the game
I ain't fucking with them niggas no mo
Shit, I feel the same way ya'll feel
Nigga, fuck Death Row (ha ha)
I cut em loose, send em juice
With visine in their cup
Catch em slipping, all my homeys get em stuck
It's the tale of a whale locked in a cell
On the streets he was the heat cause cuz had major mail
Had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains
Hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs
Nigga fucking off money, saving them hoes
Fucked off some money of mine
And bought me a white rolls
Living on Wilshire in a penthouse suite
Fucking bad bitches seven days a week
Colder than a motherfucker but now I'm hot
Floss me a brand new suit from Dionne Scott
I guess I'm balling now
Money falling down
I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now
Doggy Dogg come and get with the PG
Mr. Calvin Broadus could you please come and see me
But I ain't tripping, I'm just Dogg Pound Cripping
Talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping
Make my own beats, so fuck ya'll too
And I'm down with the niggas from the you know who
We get to the point
Blaze the joint
Step into the party and holla at everybody
As long as the gin get mixed with juice
And the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce
Shit niggas gon be niggas so nigga nigga what
Just because I'm having paper don't mean fuck
I once was in the same predicament you was
Thinking to myself "Damn should I kill cuz?"
But I know deep in my heart
Two wrongs ain't right
And it started from a fist fight
I only got one life to live
I'm trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids
You dig?
I'm trying to live long like my hair
Put the shit down, like Fred Estaire
I want to share my world
But how the fuck can I share it
Everytime I throw you something
You look at mine and compare it
Man, it's a cold shame
But it's a cold game
I ain't make the rules to this game
Look, all I know and all I do
Is try to come through with something new
Banging for you
So whatever you do, you like it or not
Because when your shit play out
I be back on the dope spot
My grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said
"Son get your money like that" (get your money, man)
I sit alone in the zone
Face of stone
Live the live of Al Capone
A Don Corleone
Casually casualties, fatalities
And all kind of funny looking niggas coming after me
Funny, it's got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding
Eastside up, Eastsiders cause we riding (eastside up)
This is portable something to fuck with your ear
Doggy Dogg will appear to make it sound so clear
I fucks it up, like I always do
And that's a trick
I'm saying some shit
To make the bitches want to suck my dick
See it's an everyday thang
Communicating to ya'll with the Dogg Pound Slang
Back up in the house and we just don't stop
Call ya mama, fuck her fat, call the motherfucking cops
Hit roccs, yeah, you know what? You know what
They told me like this

[Refrain x 2]
