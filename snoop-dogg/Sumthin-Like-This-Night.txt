Top selector number 1
Big Snoop D-O double G, yeah
Come again, boom, boom
Sumthin' 'bout this night
Sumthin' 'bout this life, ya

Them a dealer, I'mma killer
Snoopy Dogg with The Gorillaz
Layin' low on the floor
My hands are pot, I'm full of dro

Roomies try to kiss me slow
I'm leanin' like a 64
This life I live's incredible
These trees I breath are medical

Take a look in my eyes
Hold on tight, enjoy the ride
If you don't feel good then you're outta place
My universe is outta space

My look, my style, my Prada case
Low daddy get outta face
Trip this, sip this, hit that, now sit on back
And let Dogg go and  get on that

Party people, you wouldn't bite it
If you never tried it
Sumethin' like this night
I can try to smoke with you
Sumethin' like this night

If you never tried it
Sumethin' like this night
I can try to smoke with you
Sumethin' like this night

Sumethin' like this night
Sumethin' like this night

What a night to get involved
Everybody have a ball
Celebrate and fill your cup
Drink until you get enough

How you feel, I got that feeling
Disco lights hang from the ceiling
Ain't nobody on the wall
Pop it, drop it, let that fall

Hey DJ, play my song
Step back, let it bang all night long
I need your attention, no hopin' or wishin'
Come in, you got the permission

Said I do, right there I do
Get up and get money, yup, that I do
Rode it, ride it, lick it
Bite it, roll it, ride it

Party people, you wouldn't bite it
If you never tried it
Sumethin' like this night
I can try to smoke with you
Sumethin' like this night

If you never tried it
Sumethin' like this night
I can try to smoke with you
