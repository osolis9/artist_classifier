I was born, coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin' I had to know
Had to be real sneaky

Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin' on the eastside
(Ghetto)

In the ghetto
(Ghetto)
I never knew what my life would be
  (Ghetto)
In the ghetto
(Ghetto)
I'll show what I'm talkin' 'bout
  (Baby love, ghetto)

In the ghetto
(Ghetto)
When ya comin' from the eastside
(Ghetto)
In the ghetto
(Ghetto)
I see you takin' bills
  (Baby love)

I'm ready to ride, ready to roll, ay check this mack
I bet you're boyfriend ain't knowin' that I'm steadily blowin' your back out
Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at 'em like what's up trick, you know how it goes

It's Friday night, the club is about to close and I was lookin' fabulous
So I, got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin' not simpin'
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin'

I keep that thang, huh, posted in the same spot
Nothin' but my khaki shorts, house shoes, boxers and my suede shine
I'm from the home of the riots
That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin' out eastside

Uhh, what y'all busters gon' do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It ain't about who's sellin' the most Caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs

If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch, I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin'
Waitin' for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin'

All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the Goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride 'til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got day tons, Goldie's got day tons

I was born, coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin' I had to know
Had to be real sneaky

Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin' on the eastside

All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin' jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin' it wet

Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin' my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm committed 'til the day I drop
Slangin' rocks, sprayin' shots, sayin' fuck the cops

Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave 'em pain as I swang on the bitches I spot
Bandanna on the antenna swangin' and ridin'
Eastsidin', ghetto life is invitin'

Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he down posed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn 'cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that

Had a nigga lookin' G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin' sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin' bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred

Now we sippin' on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin' out the teacher's aid
And now I'm 'bout to get a whoopin', but you know I'm steady woofin'
On the side where they ride the most

Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin' hot buttered toast
In the mornin' with some government cheese
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin' dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin' it up is livin' life in the ghetto

I was born, coming up from the ghetto
  (Ghetto, ghetto)
Where the OG's never let go
(Ghetto)
This is somethin' we had to know
(Ghetto)
Had to be real sneaky
  (Baby love, ghetto)

Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
(Ghetto)
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
(Ghetto)
That's what my momma always told me
(Ghetto)
When ya livin' on the eastside, ghetto
  (Baby love, ghetto)

In the ghetto
(Ghetto)
(Ghetto)
In the ghetto
(Ghetto)
Baby love

Eastside
  (Ghetto)
(Ghetto)
(Ghetto)
(Ghetto)
Baby love

In the ghetto
(Ghetto)
(Ghetto)

Eastside
(Ghetto)
(Ghetto)
Baby love
