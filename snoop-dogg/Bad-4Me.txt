Yeah, gimme some gangsta shit girl
Some of that hood shit
Coming up
Ive been doing this shit since day one
Yeah nigger, day one, day one yeah
Let me, let me, let me tell you why do you want things
Wake up in the mornin with a purpose
You can make cap, surface
East side lonely baby, turf shit
The place where I learned that
3 and the same getting bit back
Used to steal now laters at the highway center
Ill probably getting shit started
Back for the drip and tripping cold hearted
Way before I lie high man
Both double up 15s from the condo
Heat out the motherfucking frying pan
Love key is love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet in this city I aint running man
Let me show how fly I am
Play in the school, lay in the pool
And I stay in the cool
I aint playin with fools
Reset, repeat
Unlock and recock
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend yo cash
It will get in yo ass
Matter of question is this for me
Are you really in love with that bitch man?
Another mans trash is another mans treasure
Whats your pleasure?
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
An outer eye asking how can I?
How can I love somebody else
When I cant love my self enough to know
A lot of Gs snatching bad 4 me
Fuck it arent you good
Bitches bad 4 me
Bad 4 me, bad 4 me
Girl used to run what struck out on the way?
Cold things is she called me on the phone one day
Told me he was up for release
Yeah alone shit aint changed
Flipped crazy deranged
And everybodys selling that
Word to mouth, the OGs telling that
I drove it the other day
Chops and game with my big homey down
Its hard for me to run away
Step up my car and low gun to lay underlay
I press my hook if I get stuck
Well then thats whats up
Looking at you straight from a falcon eye
An outer eye asking how can I?
How can I love somebody else
When I cant love my self enough to know
A lot of Gs snatching bad 4 me
Fuck it arent you good
Bitches bad 4 me
Bad 4 me, bad 4 me
The true definition of that mixtape
How can I love somebody else
When I cant love my self enough to know
A lot of Gs snatching bad 4 me
Fuck it arent you good
Bitches bad 4 me
Bad 4 me, bad 4 me
All that you have or me was bad 4 me
