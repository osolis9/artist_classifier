I feel like a player
When I move and dance to the song
All I wanna do is get my groove on
Like this

I throw my hands like Marvin
Sorta like James Brown
How I get down
I'm holding my chain
So it don't swing
I'm sliding my feet
Staying on the beat
I dip low
Then bring it back slow
If you didn't wanna dance
The why you on floor

The mamis on the floor
With Mr. Luck on the _
Super duper behind
And baby it's a set up
Two step with me
Call your girls
I got 2 reps with me
They call the game quickly
Bitch boys move
I'm too cool for the runway
Player of the year
My gear is set for Sunday

Wait right here
Girl I'm coming back Monday
Slide right in front of me
Get our dance on
Fred Astaire
Faye Dunaway
Eyes on us
While we move to the clap
I'm nice with the jams
And I'm smooth with the rap
We in the zone with the lights and glamour
Glass full of Patron
Cold as grammar

Coat made of panther
