What up nephew?
I just wanna talk to her for a minute though
Say you know what Cardo?
See a lot of niggers wanna roll with me
They wanna smoke with me, they wanna hang with me
Basically they wanna fuck with me
What I wanna offer right now is a ride in my passenger seat
On the passenger side, get in
Come on!
Quick draw
Im fast on my heat
Buckle up and take a ride
In my passenger seat
Put your feet to the pavement
Look at my behave net
See how the be how and trip
What I was raised with
Cant no nigger fade me
Banging like the 80s
Had a lot of money
With a handful of babies
Boy this shit is crazy
Straight from the turf
Hit the red alert and
Ask Mack if thatll work
So I slide to the speed sot
Right behind the Lisa
And get a bag of peas
I avoid getting peas off
Cause his is on me
They want me but I cant fold
Im an estside rider
I was born to roll
Never tell to be told
Never sell to be sold
On the level with a rebel boy
I stay in control
And Imma let you ride with me
So you can see how it goes
And well hit the track
And let you peep out some hoes
And if you like what you see
And you agree with me
Then you enjoy
My perspective of the LBC
Kick back and roll up and mix
The Hinny with the soda
We riding like we flying
Through the system of solar
And the aroma of dojo
The atmospheric we hearing
Since Im the driver Im riding
With rear-end super suspension
The mission cant be completed
Till you get that ride
Now youre bobbing to the beat
On the passenger side
Lean back roll up
This is how it go
Windows down music up
This is how we blow
Lean back roll up
This is how it go
Windows down music up
This is how we blow
We in the trey so
Imma dip it slow
Next stop is the liquor store
Last sip pour it back
Its so good I had to
Get some more of that
Yeah and now we on teasing
Interior mizzle interior sizzle
Okay okay alright
Say it like all day
In the trey with the dogs
Thats the player life
Yeah how you feel now?
I know you probably
Want the wheel now
But I cant and I aint
So just roll up some more of that dank
And pour some more
Of that drank
And hand me that CD
So I can let the shit knock
Lick it and drop
You can hear it when we coming
We speeding up the block
While were beating up the block
Its bout to go down
Slip slide rip riding
With my Braham
