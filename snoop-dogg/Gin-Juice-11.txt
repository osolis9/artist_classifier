Get your motherfuckin' glass, 'cause it's a blast from the past
You didn't think would touch it two times nigga
Gin and Juice up in this bitch
Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor, you feel me
Get your ice, get your cups, 'cause we about to get fucked up in here
Yeah, straight up

I'm still smokin', driftin', swifta than a mothafucka
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank

Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws
Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' nigga

To fucked up off that G I and juice
C I get lose, nigga what chall wanna do
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low-low

[Incomprehensible] spot for the glock
I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg so toss out the [Incomprehensible]
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

Rollin' down the street, with heat
Drankin', [Incomprehensible], sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin' down the street, with heat
Drankin', [Incomprehensible], sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Now trip dis', I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin' with this Creole
She said, she knows Nino, now stop me loc
Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here

There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time
See I picked you up, now I'm gunna stick you up, and dick you up
And give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first

And then it got worse, 'cause now I got my hand up
And down her mini-skirt
Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way

Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain
Now it ain't no thing, 'cause she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff, I said
"Look here bitch you've had enough"

Rollin' down the street, with heat
Drankin', [Incomprehensible], sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin' down the street, with heat
Drankin', [Incomprehensible], sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up
Come on, now
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up, yeah

I'm hopped by the ice cream shop
The cops saw me, stopped me, heard me
Were's Serve-D, well serve me, since you got that big bad ass dangle
Nigga you know I'm know for havin' that big ass bank

Tryin' to find all your dope, 'cause I'm a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
'Cause times gettin' hard on the boulevard
But I refuse to loose my zip on backyard

Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something
Got some, I know you got some
Nigga stop frontin', get at your boy, hook it up like Master P
Would it be a tragedy to fill me the best weed

Rollin' down the street, with heat
Drankin', [Incomprehensible], sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin' down the street, with heat
Drankin', [Incomprehensible], sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies
