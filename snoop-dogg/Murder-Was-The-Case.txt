Song begins with shots being fired and Snoop being shot...

As I look up at the sky
my mind starts trippin',a tear drops my eye
my body temperature falls
I'm shakin' and they breakin' tryin' to save the Dogg
pumpin' on my chest and I'm screamin'
I stop breathin,damn,I see demons
dear God I wonder can you save me
I can't die my Booboo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's to late for prayin'
hold up,a voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin':
"Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better"
How long will I live?
"Eternal life and forever"
But will I be the G that I was?
"I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
so relax your soul
let me take control,close your eyes my son"
My eyes are closed.

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my momma and my daddy and my homiez in my corner,
It's gonna take a miracle they say
for me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some ki's
to get back on my feet
and everything that nigga said came to reality
livin' like a baller loc
havin' money and blowin' hella chronic smoke
I bought my momma a benz my booboo a jag
and now I'm rollin' in a nine trizay('93)L Dogg ragg
"Just remember who changed your life
cause when you start set trippin',that ass is mine"
indeed.agreed
proceed to smoke weed
never have I want, never have I need
they say I'm greedy but I still want more
'cause my eyes want to jurney some more,really doe
check it out

-Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,if I should die
before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take-

No more indo,gin and guice
I'm on my way to Chino,rollin on the grey goose
shackled from head to toe
25 with an izL with nowhere to gizo
I know
them niggas from the other side recognize my face 'cause it's O.G.
D.O.G.G-L.B.C.
mad doggin' niggas 'cause I don't care
red jumpsuit with two brades in my hair
niggas stare as I enter the center
they send me to a level 3 yard thats where I stay late
nite I hear toothbrushes scrapin' on the floor
niggas gettin' they shanks just incase the war
pops off,'cause you can't tell what's next
my little homey Babyboo took a pencil in his neck
and he probably wont make it to see 22
I put that on my momma I'm a ride for you Babyboo
