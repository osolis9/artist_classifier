You're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
Been wanting to see you
And tell you you're so tight, yeah

My special lady
You're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight

On New Year's Eve
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I do believe
(I do believe)
On New Year's Eve
(On New Year's Eve, we can make it)
We can live forever
(We can live forever and ever)

11:59 and not a second later
She stay in the mix, like a crossfader
It's 'bout to go down, no elevator
Live for the moment, love in the air

She got me feeling like I don't wanna be a player
Real talk, so I don't wanna be unfair
Now watch the apple drop and celebrate the year
Yeah, I see you shinin'  way from over there

And all them other girls, no, they don't compare
I whisper something bomb to you all up in your ear
I infiltrate your mind and then I penetrate her
I get it crackin', baby, call me the crackolator

You're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
(Let's make it a great night)
Been wanting to see you
(You know I see you)
And tell you you're so tight, yeah
(Damn)

My special lady
You're one of a kind
(You're one of a kind)
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight
(On what?)

On New Year's Eve
(Do you believe?)
And I do believe
(Yeah, you gots to believe in somethin')
On New Year's Eve
(Can't stop me, won't stop me)
We can live forever
(We can live, baby, forever and a day)

Grab a glass, make a toast to the good life
Bacardi Lime and Ciroc help pass the time
Leather seats in the back of the Phantom ride
You stay on my mind so I had to make you mine

Master kush smoke for a mastermind
My special lady, only one of a kind
I never seen it comin', I guess love is blind
New Year's, watch the city come to life

Yeah, I must say, girl, you're looking right
Your hair did, nails did, dress fittin' tight
I think I just might say she the one I like
See we can live forever, girl, this is our night

You're having a good day
Let's make it a great night
(Let's make it a great night)
Been wanting to see you
(You know I see you, boo)
And tell you you're so tight, yeah
(You so tight)

My special lady
You're one of a kind
(You're one of a kind)
And every time I see you shine
It's like the lights of midnight
(On what?)

On New Year's Eve
(Do you believe?)
And I do believe
(You got to believe in somethin', why not believe in me?)
That you and me
(That you and me)
We can live forever
(We can live forever and a day, yeah)
