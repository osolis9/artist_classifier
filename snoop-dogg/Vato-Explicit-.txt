I was chillin' right around my way
21st Eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G

Askin' where I from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang

What's in it's what's soft, Dogg is the law
I have you niggaz runnin' like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it

But they don't know once they get close
It's tic tac toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West, they spray, I heard the esse say, he said

"Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard
  (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers and said, 'You know who we are'
He said, 'I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg'â€

"They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
  (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just chargedâ€

Blaow, run nigga, run nigga
Blaow, duck nigga, duck nigga
Blaow, run motherfucker, run
Blaow, run motherfucker, run

Blaow, run nigga, run nigga
Blaow, duck nigga, duck nigga
Blaow, run motherfucker, run
Blaow, run motherfucker, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three motherfuckers dead and I ain't seen shit
But these niggaz'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case whether you could see

I crack the Mac back and pop off rollin'
And smack your neck back, you drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me

Fuck that, I didn't give a fuck about the law
Niggaz say they wanna brawl, you would think
That they would brawlers
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menathol

You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my door? What the fuck? No
See, these niggaz proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed or you'll hear my enemies goin'

"Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard
  (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers and said, 'You know who we are'
He said, 'I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg'â€

"They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
  (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just chargedâ€

Blaow, run nigga, run nigga
Blaow, duck nigga, duck nigga
Blaow, run motherfucker, run
Blaow, run motherfucker, run

Blaow, run nigga, run nigga
Blaow, duck nigga, duck nigga
Blaow, run motherfucker, run
Blaow, run motherfucker, run

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggaz in they mouth, goddamn
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets
Run with them niggaz with the heat

You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wantin' peace
In fact I could be 'Beast of the East', motherfucker

I never hesitate to blaze
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, this my peoples
They screamin' that, â€½We need more for fun or is it legal?â€

B-b-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by
It's a shame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the esse's say, they go

"Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard
  (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers and said, 'You know who we are'
He said, 'I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg'â€

"They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car
  (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firin' and then he just chargedâ€

Blaow, run nigga, run nigga
Blaow, duck nigga, duck nigga
Blaow, run motherfucker, run
Blaow, run motherfucker, run

Blaow, run nigga, run nigga
Blaow, duck nigga, duck nigga
Blaow, run motherfucker, run
Blaow, run motherfucker, run
