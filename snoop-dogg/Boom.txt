Get your money, whip ya hair
Executive branch blow my smoke like a player
Yeah, in the club, yes, it cracks
Cute little mama, but they stack with backs

I'm smokin' great purple-urple
You and Doggie world, come and join my circle
I'll break down herbal 'til I move like a turtle
My money is green and my Porsche is turbo

In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Baby's the lawyer, her body's the truth
I'm in the game for real, it pays to chill
I walk in the club and they front the bill

I'm the big Dogg, best beware
You coming with me, if you stop and stare
Should be on my team in my car on the way to the spot
Yes, you are

Toasting up, posting up
And when we're done, we west coasting, love
For shindo blowin' endo
How much for the dog in the window?

Oh, what?
Boom, boom
Say what? Say what?
Boom
Talk to 'em T-pain

Baby, I'm a Dogg, I'm a Dogg
Beware, beware
I'll do whatever, however I want, I want
You flip me out, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now put your hands in the air
Whip your hair and go
La, la, la, la
Boom shakalaka when I drop down my elbows, say
La, la, la, la
One pay the pointer, shawty know that I ain't playing

I'm all about the money, the money I got
On the VIP tip, Maserati's in the lot
Chillin' with stars where the bottles never stops
Got a model on my lap, baby, show me what you got

With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls wanna do it today
Real tough, the suites is next
One more drink gon' lead to sex

These girls is bad, the flow is packed
They shut the Dogg down when he reach the max
Whatcha trying to drink?
Clearer yet, she got her Apple Bottom, homie
All I need to do is mack

I does it well, your game is whack
I get to the bit, there's no chit chat
Now where do we go? I beats the gush
She's in love with the gangster, that's what up, that's what up

Baby, I'm a Dogg, I'm a Dogg
Beware, beware
I'll do whatever, however I want, I want
You flip me out, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now put your hands in the air
Whip your hair and go
La, la, la, la
Boom shakalaka when I drop down my elbows, say
La, la, la, la
One pay the pointer, shawty know that I ain't playing

Boom shakalaka, here comes the chief
Like I smoke good with T-pain, Snoop the weed doctor
Big 808 now filled the base in ya chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta

Coke bottle shape, like green eyes
Drunk offa love like a Colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs, I'ma smoke 'til I die
Just bust a bad one for my homie D-Dimes

They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains, you ever taste purple rain?
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, it's still a G-Thang

Lil mama whip ya hair
Exhale the chronic as the smoke disappears
I'm ready to ball your girl on my team and she ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg

Boom
Say what? Say what?
Boom
I don't think they heard you
Boom
Talk to 'em T-pain

Baby, I'm a Dogg, I'm a Dogg
Beware, beware
I'll do whatever, however I want, I want
You flip me out, oh yeah, oh yeah

Now put your hands in the air
Whip your hair and go
La, la, la, la
Boom shakalaka when I drop down my elbows, say
La, la, la, la
One pay the pointer, shawty know that I ain't playing
