Guten Tag! Ich liebe dich auch
Ich can't find on sis sing
Oh, mein God, ich love a conna, sing con me
Ich swear to God, dizzy und busted

You know my story, I did a lot of ballin'
Been around the world, a lot of girls call it
A lot of pennies fallin' out the air and on the stage
If my label's a book, you couldn't miss a page
But none of that really matter when I cut my eyes and roll
See 'em pass by, I nearly dropped my phone
I'm like Snoopie Bree, cush er'where I go
I couldn't think straight, pimping was all alone
Should have seen her walk like a model do
Open your (???) let doggy take yo hand
I'm seeing weddin' rings, call Diddy, lets make the plans
She got me high, I don't wanna leave
I see her walk best, but she's something to see
And now I'm on the flame, feelin' so ashamed
I didn't catch her name, I call 'er Miss Everything

Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her)
Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes
Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle)
Make the ground pile up (?)
I keep runnin' the tune at her
But the numbers neva have exchanged
Everytime, every city, Miss Everything
Miss Everything

You know my story, I watched a lot of crowd
Sold millions of records, I love my fans so loud
I got a thousand cars and all the perks of being
A real superstar, I live super-far
But none of that really matters when I cut my eyes in Spain
She walked in to me, like you did yo thang
And that Spanish accent, the one I love so much
She look like an angel, one I wanted to touch
I blink my eye for a second and then she disappear
When I see that pretty woman, I felt like Richard Gere
Ball on, ain't neva been one of that watch and pass
Unless we in a room, and I leave and they watch that ass
But baby smth else, somehow I didn't speak
I been here so long, maybe I reached my peak
And now I'm in the plane, fellin' total shame
I didn't catch her name, I call 'er Miss Everything

Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her)
Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes
Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle)
Make the ground pile up (?)
I keep runnin' the tune at her
But the numbers neva have exchanged
Everytime, every city, Miss Everything
Miss Everything

Yeah, you know my story, I seen a lot of hoes
A lot of gold diggers, Luda' call 'em "goes"
I don't call 'em back, and that's just how it goes
Most people call me Snoopy, or S to double O
But none of that really matters when I was in NY
I had a show at the Guard, you know, up at Corse
That's when I seen 'er, from the distance, she smile at (???)
Now, everything I learned in the game told me she chose
And I don't miss a beat, this time I gotta speak
She look magnificent, like smth to eat
Ergo, I can't let her go, I made my way through the crowd
Lets get outta here, head off for Lee Child(?)
A lot of stars in place, Doggy set the mood
I'm like "I like yo style", she's like "I like yours too"
Before I hit this plane, I gotta know yo name
She smiled as if she came, call me Miss Everything

Tell me, have ya seen her (Seen her)
Got something, pretty face and big brown eyes
Smile many ways that the floor gon' struggle (Struggle)
Make the ground pile up (?)
I keep runnin' the tune at her
But the numbers neva have exchanged
Everytime, every city, Miss Everything
Miss Everything
