El Lay
Sunset Boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the 'Walk of Stars', now you in Cali
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard

Hollywood
Downtown and back, life is always good
It's not an act, we so fresh, so hood
  (It won't stop)
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would

Lakers, Dodgers, Ducks, Kings
Angels, Clippers, real set trippers
Clarify ride, we bonafide dippers
ESPN, you know Sports Centre

Spooned and groomed, dipped and wet
Home of the NBA championship
Purple and Gold, homie, let the story be told
It's the city where you shoot your favorite television episode

And you can hit the strip, Sunset Boulevard
But you gotta have a Low-rider car
With the skirts draggin', with the plaque in the back flaggin'
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon

That's how we represent it, Dogg
Birthplace of Chevrolet '64
Yeah, I love showin' it out
First things first, my nig', you better know where you at
You in

El Lay
Sunset Boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the 'Walk of Stars', now you in Cali
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard

Hollywood
Downtown and back, life is always good
It's not an act, we so fresh, so hood
  (It won't stop)
You knew that it never would
You knew that it never would

Ridin' on the 405
On my way to pick up, baby
85 in the winter time
Man, this place is crazy

I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
Southern surfer Cali

Rollin' down Fairfax, just left the Nico
Bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doin' the house of blues

About 9 o clock, stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncin' ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary

Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smellin' like a skunk
But it's all legal in LA, everybody taking a hit
From the politicians, athletes and even the teachers

My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher
He say, "Snoop Dogg, I really wanna meet ya"
Yeah, I love showin' you now
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at
You in

El Lay
Sunset Boulevard, Pacific Highway
Out to the 'Walk of Stars', now you in Cali
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard

Hollywood
Downtown and back, life is always good
It's not an act, we so fresh, so hood
  (It won't stop)
You knew that it never would
Knew that it never would
