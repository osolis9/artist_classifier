We would like for you to help us welcome a very distinguished speaker 
He hails from the DPG 
Would you please stand and welcome the one the only 
OG Nate Dogg 

Now I was about eight when I caught my first case 
My mother she turned her back and bowed her head in disgrace 
Now I didn't do a thing I was just standing by 
Here's a message to the youngsters today: standing by you can die 
Usually I'm in the house but today I snuck home 
And when I walk down the Long Beach streets, what a lesson they taught 
While walkin' to the cornerstore a big mistake was made 
My big homey I was walkin' with decided he needed to get paid 
So he loaded up his .32 and walked right in the store 
He said "Dear God, forgive me please but I can't be broke no more" 
Now remember I was just eight, I thought this was a joke 
What I'm sayin' I ain't playin', it was funny til that nigga got smoked 
Can you guess who that could've been quite easily? 
But it wasn't so I'm lucky to be standing right here to see 

[Chorus]
One more day, one more 
One more day 
One more day, one more 
One more day 

One more day, I'm hangin' around so I can see 
Little Nate have a pocket full of money just like his daddy 
Everyday I'm sellin' big dope, it's all that I know 
I ain't workin' and I got a baby so don't axe me what for 
One more day, gather round everybody and listen to me 
I gotta another story about the penitentiary 
One more day, see while I was servin' cavi I forgot to think 
Say for instance they catch me, little Nate'll never see 
Now remember I'm sellin' big dope but I'm packin' my thangs 
And every corner police watchin', I ain't crazy so I'm leavin' the game (I'm 
Leavin' the game) 
But I guess I waited too late 'cause they just caught me 
Now I'm locked up, every mornin' I am prayin' for my son's safety 
One more day, I'd like to thank you for watchin' over my D-O-double G's 
And would you keep an extra eye on Nate Dogg especially 
I guess I'll just continue liftin' from day to day 
And if I live to see tomorrow, thank you for one more day 

[Chorus]
