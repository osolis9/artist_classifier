Life goes on
(Life, life, life, yeah)
Life goes on
(Life, life)

Lil Tone, Lil Loc Half Dead ken folk
Papa Loc, gun smoke, beer bottles and dope
Remines twist shit blaze it up and spit this real shit
For the homies that R.I.P.

Don't trip on crip we keep y'all alive
Meech Dogg bigg Ernest, Fred Dogg three times
Like bub Scarface, T-Loc 1 and 2
Big 40 mick Dogg this ones for you

Sammy Parker we ain't forgot about you O.G. 'cuz
I'ma show these niggas how it's supposed to be done
G-Bo gator, you know I ain't no hater

Remember Boot, Murf and Dale, I miss the homies a lot
D O Dubb you the realest nigga I feel it Dogg

Pancake Lil' man, Lil' Tray & Jay Dogg

Kids live a long life, live a strong life
Not the wrong life, let 'em live they own life

Pancho loc and my homeboy Nollan
Big blue from the rear block
You keep it real wit a nigga since the pop loc

Yyou bought me soda pop
My nigga cartoon, Lil' Noock and Pete Both from the north
We meet in 7th grade on the B-Ball court
Just like the homie Demon Loc
Damn too many of my homies got smoked

Before I lost 2Pac I lost my Grand Pa
Tha Raw Dogg, I called him pa pa, aah naw
Not Reverend Harris too
Dear God, tell me what our church gone do

Life goes on
(Life, life, life)
Life goes on
(Life, life, life, remember, remember)
Remember your loved ones that were, here now there gone
Life goes on

If you think that's bad, well that ain't all
I gotta give a couple of shouts out to my doggz
Eazy E, Roger Troutman and The Notorious, B.I.G.
My Big Homeboy Mooch

You know I love your moms to death
In Heaven she rest, H.D. Mary was your pride and joy
And Warren G y'all my Mutha Phukkkin' homeboyz
He lost Ola Mae the same way

See I be lookin' at y'all
And wantin' to touch my momma everyday
I don't know what I'm goin' through but I'm there for you
See on some real shit homie, I care for you

Rough times, Rough Rhymes, heartache
Man I ease the pane with a glass of bacarda
But how could I and why should I
Cause on the real folks it's hard to say goodbye

Life goes on
(Life, life, life)
Life goes on
(Life, remember, remember y'all)
Remember tha G'z that were, here now there gone
(Life, life, life)

Life goes on
(Life, life, life)
Life goes on

Life goes on
(Life, remember)
Remember tha G'z that were, here now there gone
