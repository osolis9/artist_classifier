Wassup B? These *** is outta line, man
What's the matter, dog, you can't control your ***?
Check this out, man

I got *** all in my game that don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say *** in my face
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***

You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one

Real *** from the DPG

I appreciate the way y'all skate
When the clock hit eight, now April an' Kate
Y'all be doin' too much, runnin' your mouths
*** *** up, you gotta get up

'Cause I done had enough
Gettin' sick an' tired of the same stuff
You told Kamil an' she told Karla
An' she told April an' now they all know
But I could give a *** 'cause all y'all my ***

So, all that confrontin', the real *** on site
Today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these *** an' tell then like this, dog

I got *** all in my game that don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say *** in my face
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***

You are the one, you are the one, you are the one
You are sexy, sexy, sexy

Sexy mother***

Nina do this an' Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, ***, them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the block
At an early age, man, I was on the cock

Non-stop, I beat it up an' tell that *** to get goin'
They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Hollerin' out, poppin' a collar out
An' talkin' *** on the phone to me at my baby moma's house

Look here, ***, do you know who the fuck I am?
You better read your *** first telegram
You remind me of this *** that used to work for me
Had to cut this *** up 'cause she tried to get too close to me

An' tried to confront me at a club one night
*** with her friend, a fake ***
But you know, I had to stop an' oppose
An' I put my hand on my balls an' said check this out, dog

I got *** all in my game that don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say *** in my face
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***

You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one
You are sexy, sexy, sexy
You are so sexy, sexy mother***

You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one
You are sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy mother***

I got my own spot an' I got my own keys
So can't no *** talk this *** to me
Like Kiki did me, *** changed the locks
An' kicked me up outta spot

I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another *** an' she worked at the convalesence home
She say she needed a companion, ***, I needed a chaperone
Plus a new home, snap, crack, it's on

But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that, Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin', I was jerkin' that skirt

An' fuckin' with all her friends that was flirtin'
An' when she found out she told me that this *** hurt
A week later she fell in love with my homeboy, Kurt
***, you ain't *** but dirt for dirt

I got *** all in my game that don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say *** in my face
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***

You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one
You are sexy, sexy, sexy
You are so sexy, sexy mother***

You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one
you are sexy, sexy, sexy
Sexy mother***

I got *** all in my game that don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***
You could talk all day behind my back
But won't say *** in my face
Then pump your brakes, you ***, ***

You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one
You are sexy, sexy, sexy
You are so sexy, sexy mother***
