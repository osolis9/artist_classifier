Let yo' mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes
New fools, you fool, these fools, all y'all
Talkin' bad about me, and my motherfucking dawg
He ain't trippin', i ain't trippin' but y'all niggas still dissin'
To me, some of these suckers'll never get it
Full clip, and if i miss it i'ma tip it on the crip
Dogghouse in your mouth, now tell me how you livin'
Who the villan? You the villan? Nigga, Ren is the villan!
My homie from the CPT, cold chillin'
Now as time flies by i see the game gettin' mo' reala
As i get mo' scrilla, can you dig it?
I always tend to come with it
Gravy train on yo' brain, nigga come get it!
Im too young to retire, i'm having fun with it
See when you learn what to do with it i'll be done with it
Come with it!
Go! (just go away!) go away!
(Snoop) Niggas can't be trusted
(KoKane) Just come back another day
(Snoop) Niggas be on bitch shit
(KoKane) Just go far away!
(Snoop) Niggas get it twisted
Just go away!
Now, she said she don't like a G
Well listen here bitch get the fuck from 'round me
You thought that you was 'bout to get a drink on me?
I put hands on you bitch like suger free
I always let a bitch know her bounderies
Same with a nigga, i treat him like a flea
You claim to be, you aim to be in my spot
Motherfucker, you will get popped (BLAOW!)
Not, knowing who you fucking with, niggas be on bitch shit
Nigga we be fucking quick, nigga we ain't talkin' shit
When the heat speak, niggas be on bitch shit
Tryin' to get somewhere, coverin' up they biscuit
And then he in the club, all up on my dilznick
But when i leave, you niggas pullin' trick shit
But it's cool, cause niggas gonna miss this
Cause i'ma keep it all business, what is this?
Go! (just go away!) go away!
(Snoop) Niggas can't be trusted
(KoKane) Just come back another day
(Snoop) Niggas be on bitch shit
(KoKane) Just go far away!
(Snoop) Niggas get it twisted
Go away!
I said let you mind not be confused
If you can walk this walk nigga take my shoes
You fools, these fools, new fools, all y'all
