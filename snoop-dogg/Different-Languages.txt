You make me say, you make me say
You make me say, oh
You make me say, you make me say
You make me say

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking
I'm from the suburbs but it's that good
You make a good girl wanna get to the hood

You make me say, you make me say
You make me say
So good, got me speaking different languages

Is you alive like a side do
All I wanna do is like be inside you
Ride you, try to find you
Fill you, revive you

Going with your bad self baby 'cause I do adore
And I give you more
Put it on you all the time you know me amore
We got for sure, pure, alivea lore
Don't trip, I ain't leaving you for

Jaze got Beyonce, I got Shante
With no entrÃ©e, that's my baby
You know the thing about when I bring 'em out
Feels so good I had to sing about

Get it, get it now we flying out of town
Checking in the suite, pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Hey yo, Jaz tell 'em how I put it down

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking
I'm from the suburbs but it's that good
You make a good girl wanna get to the hood

You make me say, you make me say
You make me say
So good, got me speaking different languages

Is it the way you look?
Is it the way you walk?
Is it the way you cook?
Is it the way you talk?

I think it's all of the above
No play time in the day time, making love
Kids go to school, we can act a fool

Skinny dip in the pool, do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Hey yo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking
I'm from the suburbs but it's that good
You make a good girl wanna get to the hood

You make me say, you make me say
You make me say
So good, got me speaking different languages

Hey baby, oh, oh, oh, oh
You got me going outta my head, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You got me saying thing I don't understand

Ladies if your man make you say
He's here to stay, he's here to stay
Ladies if your man make you say
He's here to stay, here to stay

Oh, oh yes, I am this my plan
You my girl, I'm your man
Take your pain, take my hand
Take my name, make my kids

Do your thing, ain't no game
Show no shame if I'm the boss
Boss lady must be your name, so I got you, got 212
Put your face on my back brand new tattoo

20 years in the game, what love won't do
A lot of women want me but I want you
You look cute when you smile so I renewed our vows
Now days I ain't moving that wow, I changed my style

It might happen to you what gotten to me
Shit, I gotten to you and start raping 'bout things
Like love and being true
Now maybe we could make another baby or 2

I'm from the East Coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigger got me crib walking
I'm from the suburbs but it's that good
You make a good girl wanna get to the hood

You make me say, you make me say
You make me say
So good, got me speaking different languages

You make me say, you make me say
So good, got me speaking different languages
