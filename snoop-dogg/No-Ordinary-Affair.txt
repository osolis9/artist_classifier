feat. Iza


[Verse 1]
I thought I would never do something like that
But it happened so fast
The way that you looked into my eyes
It was love, you can't deny
I'm standing here outside your place and I'm watching you
And I'm watching you
And they don't know about your life
But it's been so long and this time truth can be right

[Hook]
I felt true love and I'm not prepared for us to break
This love, it sure isn't fair
They'll never know how much it will hurt for us to break
No ordinary affair...
No ordinary affair...
No ordinary affair...
No ordinary affair...

[Verse 2]
I thought I would never do something like that
But it happened so fast
The way that you looked into my eyes
It was love, you can't deny
I'm standing here outside your place and I'm watching you
And I'm watching you
And they don't know about your life
But it's been so long and this time truth can be right
