Some of 'em lie about the shit they got
And what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the girls they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life

So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life

Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxin', it's more for me

Baby, this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understandin' how I'm livin'
Show them hoes how you winnin'
It's the beginnin' with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon

But everyday like 50 say, it's 'Many Men'
They wanna take me out the spot
They want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go

You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them niggaz is a beast

But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first, nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

See me, man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block slangin'

I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything, just don't fuck with my money

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz
With the platinum mouths
Thinkin' that they blessed by the actions that be comin' out
When you in Magic City, you be carryin' a lot of clout

But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin' it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it, nigga, if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin' with it for a dolla

If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow

But I would never bother breakin' out 'Tha Doggfather'
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreadin' game to my partners
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the Doctor

You see me man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block slangin'

I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything just don't fuck with my money
