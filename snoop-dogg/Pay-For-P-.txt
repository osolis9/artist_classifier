The stock market has always been a 100 percent
When it comes to pussy, the worlds oldest profession
Yeah it's still alive, no matter what the consequences
A trick gonna still buy it, no matter how sick they make it
A hard stick gonna still wanna play it

Marching up, every day and every night to the drummers beat
Titled the oldest profession and it never fell back
Not even in the recession, no Christmas toys for the kids
Yeah daddy fucked it up, he said he was drunk
Playing poker with the boys, yeah niggas pay for pussy

Remember that Easter Sunday, it was so damn sunny
We didn't get no Easter clothes, candy or Easter bunny
Yeah, daddy fucked it up, rollin' dice with the boys
Yeah niggas pay for pussy, whether it's at the tity bar
Or outta the car, yeah niggas pay for pussy

Oh yeah, some niggas pay for pussy
Oh yeah, some niggas pay for pussy
Oh yeah, some niggas pay for pussy
Oh yeah, dem niggas pay for pussy
Oh yeah, niggas pay for pussy
