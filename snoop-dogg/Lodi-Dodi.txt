Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga, Slick Rick
For those who don't like it, eat a dick
But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this

La Di Da Di, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're, just some niggaz who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic, right

For all my Doggs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when ya cause a cozy condition
And which we create, 'cause that's our mission

So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens everyday
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin'
I gave myself a stretch up, a mornin' yawn

And went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said, â€½Umm, mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top Dogg of them all?"

There was a rubble, dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are you conceited bastard"
Well, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf

Used Oil of Olay, 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath

Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne

Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks, with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my indo

Then I dilly-dally, I ran through an alley
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley
This was a girl playin' hard to get
So I said, "What's wrong?", 'cause she looked upset

She said, â€½Umm it's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your dope away from meâ€

Damn, now what was I to do
She's cryin' over me and she was feelin' blue
I said, "Umm, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"

Her mean mother steps then says to me, "Hi"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete

The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Somethin' was wrong I said, "What was goin' on?"
I tried to break up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either"

She grabbed my closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started cryin' on my shoes and grabbin' my dick

And sayin', â€½Why don't you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love todayâ€

Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept goin'
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, "Cheer up", so I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you, bitch"

She said, "No you're not," then she starts cryin'
I says, â€½I'm nineteenâ€, she says, "Stop lyin'"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"

Yeah, uhh, tic-toc you don't stop
And to the, ah tic-toc and you don't quit
Yeah, tic-toc and ya don't stop
And to the, ah tic-toc and ya don't quit
Bitch
