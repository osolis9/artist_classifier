Real nigga shit

Real nigga shit
Now I'm 'bout to show you how the West Coast rock
Real nigga shit

Here come the villain again, grab your hoe and get the fuck outta town
This nigga shit make the world go round
It's that black nigga ren, duck when I bust
Make Jada get on these nuts, make will, love to cuss

You wanna fuck with us? Man, I wouldn't do it
Ask this nigga here, his ass, we ran right through it
You out actin' like yo' shit be tight
Get some shit, fuck it off like Tamika Wright

Get the fuck out my site, I reincarnate
Droppin' West Coast shit in every motherfuckin' state
Motherfuckin' legend, y'all niggaz be knowin'
You can leave yo' bitch and keep on goin'

I am doggy Dogg bitch love to hit a switch
Never hit a bitch, love that gangsta shit
Can I hear your flow? Can I fuck yo' hoe?
Boy you hard on 'em, nigga you ain't know?

When you testify, you got to keep it fly
A lot of niggaz lie, shit we do or die
Everyday we high, it's like a nine to five
I got my nina my fo'-heata beata by my side

I keep it tucked close when I'm on the West Coast
I keep it on post when I'm with my east coast folks locs
Y'all know what's crack-a-lack
I'm from the hood of the drive-by's and kidnappings, and car-jackings

Me and Snoop Dogg on the hog
On our way to the mall, fuck alla y'all
We gon' ball till we fall, watch the chrome crawl
Intercept these fine bitches 'cause we want 'em all

Droppin' drawers, poppin' coochie and lickin' balls
Only gangsta ass nigga follow nigga laws
Only gangsta ass bitches get to run the hogs
Only real ass niggaz get to set it off

Now, the way I gets off in that ass it's a sin to not assassin'
Grab a microphone have flashbacks and start flashin', ah
I'm bound to toast ya, string you up like you was on the Ponderosa
Sip on mimosa do it that way 'cause I'm supposed ta

Now most of ya, don't measure up
I'll make it hot and turn the pressure up
Steamin', regular, nah supreme and I ain't gassed
I blow an MC away like Fox when I pass

Ain't nuttin' shitty about this here fuck around and that's that ass
Just like, grass I, I want more green than the Goblin
Matter of fact I want more bank than that chick that be modelin'
My Uzi weighs more than a single ton

I leave you single son, who wanna mingle not a single one
Hah, now tell me what you figure, nigga
Rob load up the show slow flow spitter
The hard hitter the R nigga, roll
I break it down sweet then I bring it back slow

Me and Snoop Dogg on the hog
On our way to the mall, fuck alla y'all
We gon' ball till we fall, watch the chrome crawl
Intercept these fine bitches 'cause we want 'em all

Droppin' drawers, poppin' coochie and lickin' balls
Only gangsta ass nigga follow nigga laws
Only gangsta ass bitches get to run the hogs
Only real ass niggaz get to set it off

Nigga that was dumb diggy diggy dumb dumb
Here them niggaz come kiddy kiddy come come
I think a nigga sprung spriggy spriggy sprung sprung
Probably why he done diggy diggy done done

Yo' lady think I'm cute, I be knockin' her boots
When she's away from home, she be swallowin' juice
You thinkin' that's yo' son, but he ain't lookin' like you
See the barrel of a gun, nigga whatcha gon' do? Set it off

Niggaz pop mo' shit while we drop mo' shit
Continuously, nigga nigga please
Slang yo' ki's, birdies and trees
You can catch me and my niggaz, overseas

Shootin' the breeze, with a cute Vietnamese
Or was she Lebanese? I think she Chinese
It really don't matter 'cause they all on they knees
It's somethin' 'bout these motherfuckin' West Coast G's

Make that cheese, when the cops come you better not freeze
Blast on 'em like the Genovese, they yo' enemies
Lock you up and fuck you up
Talk shit to you beat you down then cuff you up

And leave you in a cell stuffed
I ain't got no money for bail, that's real as fuck
Tryin' to get a meal ticket and kick it
Chill, catch a plane to Spain or maybe Brazil
On the real can you feel me?

Yeah, yeah, set it off
It's Kurupt young Gotti
Doin' it big, for all y'all suckers
We set it off, Snoop Dogg

It's 'Tha Last Meal'
Last time y'all suckers gon' eat off my big homeboy
We set it off!
We set it off! West Coast
