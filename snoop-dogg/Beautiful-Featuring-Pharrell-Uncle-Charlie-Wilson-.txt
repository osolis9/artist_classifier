Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh yeah, there's something about you
Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl
Oh yeah, there's something about you
Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl
Oh yeah, there's something about you

I know you gonna lose it, this new Snoop shit
Come on baby, boo, you gotsta get into it
Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit

Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, lemme put you in the mood and
Lil' cutie lookin' like a student
Long hair, with cha big fat booty

Back in the days you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Here to walk with some pimp, pimp fluid

Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch 'Clueless'
I laugh at these niggas, when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know who girl that you is

Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl
Oh yeah, there's something about you
Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl
Oh yeah, there's something about you

When I see, my baby, boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it

We just blow 'dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now, she's yellin', hollerin' out, "Snoop", and

Hootin', hollerin', hollerin', hootin'
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long and black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in

Oh yeah, there's something about you
Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl
Oh yeah, there's something about you
Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl
Oh yeah, there's something about you

See, I just want you to know that you are really special
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I just want you to know that you are really special
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Oh yeah, there's something about you

Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in
You got my pictures on the wall in your room an'
Girls be complainin' you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone

You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you an'
You don't ask, why I roll witha crew, an'
Twist up my fingers and wear dark blue-in

On the east side, that's the crew, I choose
Nothin' I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you so beautiful

Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know, you're my favorite girl

See, I just want you to know that you are really special
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I just want you to know that you are really special
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why

See, I just want you to know that you are really special
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
I just want you to know that you are really special
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
