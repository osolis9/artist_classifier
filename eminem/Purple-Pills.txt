I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves

I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people and 5 I hit, ah shit
I started a mosh pit, squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids

These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again

So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down

We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out

Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid 'cos the X is gone

Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and fulla cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue

You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid, you so high
That you might wake up with a guy

On some new shit, I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills and green big pills
(That's ill)
Mescaline

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen, 80 of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno

Pop pills, pills I pop, pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray

Look for coke to smoke, no oki dok
I pack up my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy)

I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
You got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs 'cos our arms show tracks

Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue

Speed, shrooms, down the valium
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just got some and I'm going back soon

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

I'm at a rave, looking like a slave
High off chronic, gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?

Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill, drugs kill
(Yeah right)
Bitch I'm for real, shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen, 80 of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something, I dunno, fuck it
