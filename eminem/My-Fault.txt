I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aide who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan, an ex Heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music
Told me she was goin' back into usin' again
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than Heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here"

Who's in the den?
It's me and Kelly
My bad, let's try another room
I don't trust you
Shut up slut!
Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt naked, and run in the woods
Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab
Oh dag!
What?
I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag
Huh?!

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

Yo Sue!
Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's trippin'
I need to go puke
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop cryin', I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out

She said, "Help me I think I'm havin' a seizure!"
I said, "I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin' my Tshirt"
"Would you calm down you're startin' to scare me"
She said, "I'm twenty six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook"
I'm over here Sue, You're talkin' to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital before it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat
As many mushrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

Susan, wait! Where you goin'? You better be careful
Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin' to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
Before you do somethin' dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
John, where's Dave at before I bash you
He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap dude

"Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin' to plants
Choppin' her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?
Well it depends on how may you had
I took 3, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinkin' Lysol
She's gonna die dude
I know and it's my fault!
My God!

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
Susan please wake up!
Please, Please wake up
What are you doing?
You're not dead! You're not dead!
I know you're not dead
Oh my God!
Wake up, Susan wake up
Oh my God!
