Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished, huffing the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothing because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares makin' the hairs all on the back of your neck stand
Like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yah, Angela so I command you to start dancing
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansen
Enter my gas chamber, ya gangsta, my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facing a task greater, he's chasing your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure, a full dose of me
Exposing myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing
I think there's a ghost
Too much hydrocodone and Codeine
I was only supposed to swallow a half
I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink posing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosey
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodelling
Rosey, won't you come out to play
A nuisance, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stirred em
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, I'm lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events that he emerged, took over the world
And reeled in all the children, lured em into the building and killed em
Buried em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
And still can spit, drawn to gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol - three pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the building
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and
Tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be heeled
There's no one as sick as he MC's
Will get fricasseed on the grill then
