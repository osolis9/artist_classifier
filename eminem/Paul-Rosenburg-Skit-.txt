Em, it's Paul, listen, Joe just called me
And he told me you're in the fuckin' back
Behind the studio shootin' your gun off
In the air like it's a shootin' range

I told you not to fuckin' bring your gun
Around like an idiot outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself in trouble

Don't bring your gun outside of your home
You can't carry it on you
Leave the fuckin' gun at home
