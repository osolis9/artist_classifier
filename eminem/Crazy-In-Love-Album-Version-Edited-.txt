I tell myself that i was doin' all right
there's nothin' left to do tonight
but go crazy on you
crazy on you

let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh
Can't you see what you do to me baby,
you make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
i'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
you're truly the only one who can do this to me

you just make me get so crazy
i go schizo, i get so insane i just go schizophrenic
one minute i wanna slit your throat the next i wanna sex
you make me crazy

the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
we fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
cause the next day we right back at it
in the same exact pattern

what the fuck is the matter with us
we can't figure out if it's lust
or if it's love which that is attractin us to eachother
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother

which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you
even though i just hit you today but you deserved it
you hit me first and provoked me to choke you

just cause i came home late last night
crawled in bed and i woke you
but if there's one thing about you that i admire
it's baby, because you stay with me

maybe cause you're as crazy as i am
cause when i look at you
i can see an angel in your eyes but if i look deeper inside
i see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise

you're always full of surprises
always pullin devices out your personal vibrators and dildos
you've fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
you're only 24 but you're plenty more mature

then those other little ho's who just act like little girls
like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool
chillin' you play your position you never step out of line
even though i stay in your buisness

you've always kept out of mine
i wonder what's on your mind
sometimes they say love is blind
maybe that's why the first time i dotted your eye

you ain't see the sign
or maybe you did maybe you like me in charge
baby cause we're crazy in love...
I go crazy on you

crazy on you
let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh
You are the ink to my paper
what my pen is to my my pad

the moral, the very fiber
the whole substance to my rap
you are my reason for being
the meaning of my existance

if it wasn't for you i would never be able to spit this
as intense as i do, and the irony
is you rely on me as much
as i rely on you to inspire me like you do

you provide me the lighter fluid to fuel in my fire
you're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter
the only way that i'm able to stay so stable
is you're the legs to my table,

if you were to break i'd fall on my face
but i'm always gonna make you feel
i don't need you as much as i really need you
so you don't use it to your advantage
but you're essential to me
you're the air i breathe
i believe if you ever leave me
i'd probaly have no reason to be
you are the kim to my marshall
you're the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem
the alaina to my hailie
you are the word that i'm lookin for
when i'm tryin to describe how i feel inside
and the right one just won't come to my mind
you're like the pillow that props me up
the beam that supports me
the bitch who never took half
the wife who never divorced me
you're like the root to my evil
you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
and no matter how much too much is never enough
baby cause we're crazy in love...
I go crazy on you
crazy on you
let me go crazy, crazy on you ohhhh
