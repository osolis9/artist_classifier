[Intro: ~Woman~]
{screams} {cries} {dog's barkin'}
He takes everybody gone!
Somebody, pleeease! {chainsaw}
Heeeelp! {chainsaw{
Ooh, my God! {chainsaw} {dog's barkin'}
He comes for me!
Oohhh! ("It fits... perfect! ")

[Verse 1:]
Better watch out! - Sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
Onslaught! - Coming and I'm packing in my lunch up,
Bunch of - missile launcher and a bunch a contra-
Band van full of Ganja! - now come on jump!
Man stop marchin', Marshall on my gotcha,
Doin' the cha-cha and the kucharcha with a quadri-...
-... Plegic - boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
"Lindsay-to-the-Lohan" naked while you let me WATCH - YA!
Who da knew the puda do ta me what's it's done?
Such cynicism when this isn't in my sys-tem!
BLUNT hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-... -pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
"Mister-... -Help-Me" what's he said to me and then sunk,
Women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
In comes - the woman with cocoa butter skin once.

[Chorus:]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill!
Buffalo Bill! Buffa-buffalo bill!
Skin 'em up, hym 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts! Upa- upa- up in those kilts!
Man you don't want to go up in those hills!
Up in those hills! Upa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill!
Buffalo Bill! Buffa-Buffalo Bill!

[Verse 2:]
Always - you can see 'em lurking in the hallways,
Carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space!
How the hell did he fit 'em all in such a small place?
Hide 'em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take!
Well fuck it then; I got nothing but time, I'll wait,
Until it's dries for the moment I guess your all safe.
After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint,
My chainsaw's outta gas my regular saw ain't!
Now here I come again! - Damn, stomach rumbling,
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within!
Someones in - the back of my damn house rummaging,
It's a girl! - She looks pretty thin! - But I want to skin! {chainsaw}
Been - on the hunt again! - When - will it ever end?
Evelyn! - Why you tryna fight? You'll never win!
Severing - legs, arms, damn there goes another limb!
Pull the lever then - trap door; death is evident!

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3: ~Yoda~]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? - Nothing, so chill!
Fucking hoe, you better fucking hold still.
Make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don't spill,
Cut 'em gut 'em and just keep stuffing those girls,
Man, I think she had enough of those pills,
Sedate her, then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel!
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fucking told you!
I keep hearing voices like:
"Wouldn't you like to go and get ya put ya knife
And push it right through her while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
Into a barbecue or would ya do to her
What you usually do to a girl who's skins newer? "
(In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas Ornament you are!)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya til there's no more skin to ya,
Boo ya who ya think you fucking with?
Duck because here he comes again!

[Repeat Chorus:]

{Screams and soring yelling} {beat stops}
