People!  It feels so good to be back
Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the new
And improved, you know who

Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the center piece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can a bitch don't want no beef with Slim
No! Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From sÃ©ance to sÃ©ance

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back
The Boogiemonster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do si do, oh yo ho, hello there

Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your motherfuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins, hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their navy

You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin their food and their baked beans
I'm twenty-eight, they gon'
Take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane, or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's dosido now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thur ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hur down

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic hypnotic product, I got it the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk a lotta hum de lay de la la
Oochie walla walla, um di da dah da dah but you gotta gotta
Keep movin, there's more music to make

Keep makin new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry, like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny, I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pass the KY
Let's get ready for some intense, serious ass fucking!

(Dr. Dre)
Wants to square dance with me
(Nasty nas)
Wants to square dance with me
(X to the Z)
Wants to square dance with me
(Busta rhymes)
Wants to square dance with me
(Cana bitch)
Won't square dance with me
(Fan a bitch)
Won't square dance with me

Don't want no parts of me
Dirty dozen
Wants to square dance with you
Yee haw
