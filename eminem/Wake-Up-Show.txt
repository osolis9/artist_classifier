[Eminem]
Yo, Yo, Yo, Back to me, Back to me,
I can keep that beat?

Yo, Weed Lacer, 97' burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
I'm on some lok' ish,
I'm fed up wit the being broke ish
I'm not to joke wit
Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it
Having a coke-fit and goin' through withdrawls daily
Shoot up with Mesciline Infront of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many asprin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' about, "Who won it?"
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it
My 9's at your brain, is that your chain? Run it
Crews die from an over-dose of your exessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your moma's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her
(Right right right ! ! !) ((Ding ! ! !))
Cruise In nike jackets, Escaped from Psyciatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
"I might be back Trick"
So barricade your Entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses (Ooh)
Chasin' Dips
.Take em' on long vacation trips
Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit ((Laughter))
Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone
I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up, I feel just like an over worked plumber
I'm sick of the crap, what's Jack Kevorkian's phone number? (Ha. Hot)
