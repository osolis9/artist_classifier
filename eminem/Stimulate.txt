Hey, listen
I love my job, it makes me feel like, Superman
Can you fly? I can
Wanna see?

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context

Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest

Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark

But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it

See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blond
'Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on

Constantly movin', constantly using
The constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams

I'll be here when y'all are gone re building
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will copy ? Probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then 'cause

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you

My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up and you'll see that's why I dominate

I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimmick ever move you make, "Slim you're great"
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain

'Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it
But it's inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain

But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but

I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly

I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you
