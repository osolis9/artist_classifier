There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone-lines, can't dial out
I scream for police but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
There's a Doberman, Pinscher and a Pitbull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit fooling with me

Quit fooling with me
Bitch, you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
And which you're gonna see in the long run
I'ma be the wrong one

You wanna harass with this Limo tinted glass
Flashin' that flash-light on my ass, where was you at?
Last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass
Rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass

They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm posed to fight with bear palms?
Yeah, right
They coming with bombs, I'm comin' with flare-guns
We as Americans

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means

We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans

I'ma make Vuku bucks wearin' Vuku vests
Drama hanging over my head like a Voodoo Hex
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
But you know who with an S tattooed to my chest

But I've innested, now I got the Industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker
Than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty

Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said
But I said precedents and the standards
And they can't stand it

My name should've been bastard
The shit should've been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it

I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit
I done seen a fastest rap shit
And turning into some pap-pap shit
That quick, snap click
But this time they got fucking automatic
And no one gon' test this mon, clack

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means

We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans

I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
Under my Long Johns, under my Sean Johns
When running with the long arm or the long long gone

I'ma do five years or less than that
No questions asked
It might be a good idea to stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared nipped on my head

A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gone send a task
I ain't gone even ask, they ain't gone let me pack
They ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my whizz at

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at our shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health
Surviving by any means

We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at our shit has been
Take a look where you live
This is America and we are Americans
