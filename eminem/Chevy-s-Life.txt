VERSE 1 
The very first day,
I knew what my life would be like,
I wished i could fly away,
Fly away from this life.

BRIDGE:
So maybe ,just maybe
I might fly away to some random place
One random day.

CHORUS:
Its not these words are the giving,
But the life thats not worth living.
Just throw me down,treat me like dirt.
Its not as if i will ever excert.

VERSE 2
The smile stops at me 
Which blocked too much happiness,
From reaching hopeful people,
It seems im a body living lifeless.

BRIDGE
CHORUS

VERSE 3
You cant see things from my perspective,
Dont be rude, irrispective,
Of what u think, how youd cope,
When i was 11 i had my first smoke.

BRIDGE
CHORUS

You dont know what ive been through,
What lengths i will go to
