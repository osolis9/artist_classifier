Hey!
Hey Em what's up?
Steve Berman what's goin' on man?
How you doin'? Good to see you again what's up?
Em could you come here and have a seat please?
Um yeah what's?
Vanessa shut the door
Okay
So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week?
It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
What?
This album is less than nothing
I can't sell this fucking record!
What?
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wha-what's the problem?
Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violent?
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like
To be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
But, I,
I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rappin' about big-screen T-V's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicadin
I mean
I can't sell this shit!
What?
Either change the record or it's not coming out!
What? I
Now get the fuck out of my office!
What am I supposed?
Now!
Alright man
