[Intro - Eminem] 
Yeah it's Shady 
a.k.a. the army 
Shady Records 
break it down 
I do a lot of spittin 
and I dont gotta try 
but I aint got rhymes to waste 
so lets make em 

[Verso 1 - Eminem] 
I aint no gangsta 
I ain gotta start frontin 
I just call Banks (1) up 
if i need to pop somethin 
I got a friend of mine 
named fifity cent I signed 
this shits official now 
the deals is finished and it's time 
to get down tot his grind 
let's get these nicks and dimes 
so hurry up and cop 
G-Unit (2) shit before its gone 
its like a gold mine 
for my man to take nine 
and bounce right back 
he gotta be like Michael Myers (3) 
this shit must be a sign, 
these labels 
must be blind 
Columbia i know this must 
be fuckin with they mind 
they know they bout to cry 
cause they missed out but I 
know how to get the dope 
cause Dre gave me 
a business mind 
I say em a line 
I hit em with a 9 
I had a empty clip but they 
ain't check the chambers 

[Ritornello x 2 - Eminem] 
I aint no gangsta 
I ain gotta start frontin 
I just call Banks (1) up 
if i need to pop somethin 
but you gonna feel my shit 
you gonna hit the stop button 
I fuck you up a long time 
you gonna get stomped stuntin 

[Verso 2 - Eminem] 
Damn 50 
this shits about to hit the fan 50 
what the fuck happened to Ja 
he got the sickest vendetta 
he must think that you wetta 
he bought to play with his paper 
you fittin to fuck with his chedda 
now homie think we gonna sweat 'em 
but we just gonna forget 'em 
if he dont shut up we'll get 'em 
let Yayo (4) stomp 
his head in its all good 
cause we'd rather rap in the letter 
pussy play us 
outta pocket homie 
so tell 'em he better be easy 
start some bullshit 
he'll get his whole crew hit 
D-twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent, and G-Unit 
Yo he don't want it cause 
he's always drugged out 
you won't see no picture 
where his pupils aint bugged out 

[Ritornello x 2 - Eminem]
