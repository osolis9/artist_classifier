Man, let's go
Hey yo Fif'
Yeah?
Call 'em and tell 'em
It's time to hate us again
We're back

Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or Albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair

I give a **** if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes ****
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it

See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats

A little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no ****
'Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ****

And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might find your career
Come to with eek and I'm just like, oh yeah

See us on the award shows and we're like, oh yeah
Can we get more of those they like, oh yeah
See us keep blowing up we're like, oh yeah
So Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care

See me in them videos I'm like, oh yeah
See me ride up close your like, oh yeah
And where's D12 at they like, we over here
Where the **** we goin' we're like nowhere

You jealous little **** beg for my attention but
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight

They wanna talk **** let them talk **** 'cuz they talk ****
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
'Cuz no one wants to walk around stepining dog ****
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they washed it

But the pride won't let 'em inside they like go get 'em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limiteds in any size yo denim to velor

Even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would said our clothing line's on fire
Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah
And you all just like her your all **** liars

But I'll just keep **** you like I **** her
Right in the ass with K Y yessir
So full of joy boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you yeah boy don't curr

See us on the award shows and we're like, oh yeah
Can we get more of those they like, oh yeah
See us keep blowing up we're like, oh yeah
So Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care

See me in them videos I'm like, oh yeah
See me ride up close your like, oh yeah
And where's G-Unit at they like we over here
Where the **** we goin' we're like nowhere

Your homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my nana crip but I'm not there
It is what it is dog man life's not fair
Your friends should have known not to front 'round here

Listen kid where I'm from the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man I'm gonna say this one time and get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like out of nowhere

Beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak man sometimes we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bear
You probably heard about me I'm a shown up player

In the hood politicin' like I'm running for mayor
Running winding doning and shining you know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for **** around and horse playing
I'm making hits my homies taking hits whose staying

See us on the award shows and we're like, oh yeah
Can we get more of those they like, oh yeah
See us keep blowing up we're like, oh yeah
So Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care

See me in them videos I'm like, oh yeah
See me ride up close your like, oh yeah
And where's D12 at they like, we over here
Where the **** we goin' we're like nowhere

Yeah
It's the re-up
God, I love it
You know you hate that laugh don't you?
Keep doing it
Do it again
What?
The laugh
I like that
You don't think they gonna think we're really crazy right?
