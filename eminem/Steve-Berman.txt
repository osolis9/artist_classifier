Am what's up?
Steve Berman, what's goin' on man?
How you doin'? Good to see you again
What's up?

Am could you come in here and have a seat please?
Hmm, yeah, what's up?
Venessa shut the door
Okay

So, what's up? How it's odd lookin'
For the first week
It would be better if you gave me nothin' at all
This album is less than nothin'

I can't sell this fuckin' record
What?
Do you know what's happenin' to me out there?
What's the problem?

Violet Crayon told me to go fuck myself
Who's Violet?
Taylor records told me to shove this record up my ass
Do you know, what it feels like to be told
Have a record shoved up your ass?

I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rappin' about big screen TV's, blondes, forty's and bitches
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicada

I can't sell this shit
Either change the record or it's not comin' out
Now get the fuck out of my office
What I'm I supposed to?

Now
Alright man
