Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My Mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off
My Momma don't want me the next thing
I know I'm gettin' dropped off
Ring ring ring on the door bell
And the next door neighbors on their front porch
But they didn't want me neither
So they left me on someone else's lawn
Till somebody finally took me in

My great aunt and uncle, Edna 'n Charles
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
It went a little somethin' like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this
I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My Mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me
where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?  What do I look like some kind of idi
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that, why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, it's tush mull bish

Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers
Claims he had it I can't imagine it, that little rich
Poor white bastard needs to take some of that cash out the bank
And take a bath in it, man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My Mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned mom
Please believe I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?

Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like
They know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall
And take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go

But life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now
Curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the Rosie, the shows over
You can all go home now, but the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on
This ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength
To have what it takes to carry on till I pass 50
Back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My Mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My Mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
