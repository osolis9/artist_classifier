Yeah, you know technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it

Yeah, ha, ha, feels good, whoo
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get a second chance
But I ain't blowing this one
No man, ha,ha
Shit I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in the bottle
Set fire to water
Commin' out the nozzle on the fire hose
Quiet and swallow

Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand
Take his hands an cuff 'em
Spin around to freeze the clock
Take the hands of time an cuff em

Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man

There's a storm comin' that the weather man couldn't predict
I start the ball prick you better flee 'cuz I get ticked
It's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm 'bout to punch ya to the ground, ya trick

It's a trap, fuck my last CD this shit's in my trash
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last

You can die in the blink of an eye
So batchin' ya eyelashes, and keep winking and blown kisses
'Cuz your flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood, I ain't just hurting your rep

I catch a flow and get goin'
No remorse, I'm showin' they slowin', for no one
Knowin' there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin' on the target like a marksman
The target is you, I shut ya lane down

Took ya spot, parked in it too
Watchin' it flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do,
Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like whoo

That boys hot enough to melt hell burn Satan too
Fry his ass, and put his asses back together with glue
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too
This game could I'll afford to lose him
How bout you?

Now guess who who
Here's a clue, he came to a ball in a wife beater
Lost his Nike shoe, it's in ya ass
He's in ya ass, he's all up in ya psyche too
Now what's his name

Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella
Cinderella man, Cinderella man

If I had a time machine, I'm passin' ya
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Music is my time machine ahhh, ohh
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man

Fuck catching a lightnin', he struck it
Screamed shut up and thunder
Flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker
He's the shit right now he's

Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man

Cinderella man, send the fellow shady dang came
To rap the game up and sell the fame
Raise hell from hell he came

But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same
He can't afford to be a label in this day and age
And at this stage of the game

Mediocrity cannot be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the O H I, to the new case of rock
Consider it as last of rod, coop degraw
Raise 'em high in the sky, keep 'em up

Time to bring the place alive
Thanks for being patient, I will make no more mistakes
Shit my potatoes baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smoking weed, get back if the steaks are high

Shit, I ain't even suppose to be here by the grace of god
The skin on my teeth and the hair on my nuts
I skated by, now y'all are on thin ice
With anchor weights I hate to lie
How fuckin' irritated are you? How much in ya face am I?

It ain't shit you could do beferret
Prove us here in spirit, I'm the spittin' image
I'll mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics

Who?
Heres a clue
He came to the ball in his wifebeater
Lost his Nike shoe, it's in ya ass, he's in ya ass
He's all up in ya psychy too

Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella
Cinderella man, Cinderella man

If I had a time machine, I'm passin' ya
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Music is my time machine ah
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man
