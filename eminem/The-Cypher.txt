Peace Welcome to the cipher Black Thought Eminem

Yo for shin is sayin ' it's scramblers and gamblers and
Dirty money handlers

Talented number runners and
Racketeers stars and stage page cameras

Swaggerers

[Black Thought]
Check it out remix Rising up out of the flames
Like a phoenix
Straining to carry the weight
Of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing seeds let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it and did it
Because I need it
Eat sleep it and breath it write
It down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement Trash talkers deleted blast off
I lay 'em out like a... Black Thought I told you I'm a winner
Officially this unsung
Underrated under appreciated
The one them under achievers
Had under estimated finally
Graduated from something so hated one
Of the most sacred
Nobody gona ' take it face it I keep doin ' it well owning sign insistence is do it your
Self-doing
It below the radar we doin ' it stealth doin ' it again for Philadelphia And who else but you all and
See I'm on the job s See my eyes focused where
The prize is I'm like Martin They say you like Rodney the
Difference is I give it
Everything inside me
Dear diary my fans still swear
By me even though I'm late night now like here 's Johnny Swimming with them big
Whites now that 's how to find me funny how it break
Right down but Never mind
Me I'm forever grimy guess it's just silly signin ' rock roller Bi-Polar like Phyllis
[Eminem]
Like a dope fiend,
Opening up a bottle of dopamine,
Throat, choked anything,
Oh and just think how dope it
Could be,
If he smoked anything,
Oh there goes the bell,
The sound of the opening ding, I hit you as hard as
Barbiturates
In the ribs with a switch and
Stitch you at the same time
Before you could flinch to it,
My dick is so big if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I
Raped you that you was
Actually into it,
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fucking bottom
Dollar
That I remember when I was
Without a dollar bill in my
Wallet,
Now watch me kill a koala, while I maul a Chihuahua,
Bum a pill off of. like let me holla at you mama,
It's like I'm off that ba ba when I bring the fucking
Drama,
Used to bomb ya like Saddam,
But now that I'm a lil calmer, I'm a fucking cross between Osama, Obama and Dalai Lama,
Tell Miley I'm her knight in shining armor,
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift 's trailer, a picture of my
Genitalia,
With a note sayin bitch I can 't wait to nail ya.
Drug paraphernalia be ware
The were wolf will kill ya,
That's' him in the Sheep 's clothes, he just shaved his hair
