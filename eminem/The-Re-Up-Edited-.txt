We should do something like that

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again it's the illest and realest ****
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice

Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is hip hop when it's in it's

Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his **** is

And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex a chainsaw and an axe

Jump a **** desk, strangle her neck
While we have **** while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on ****

Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Drezy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track

In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do ****, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a ****, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass, 50 Cent

Nah, 'em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass
The clean parts, the **** parts
My ****, my beauty marks
The Fif'll tell you're ass apart

A came in this game
Crush a **** from tha start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy
Fifty crazy rich, ****

Different day, nothing change, it's the same ****, trick
Teflon wrapped on case I get **** on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the **** home
Still grindin', still shinin', **** lord knows

You're rockin' with the kid that spit sicka sick flows
I carried game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and 'cause a maylay

Turn the town upside down wit a frown upside down
I smile through sumthin' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm ****' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, go 'head, **** up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, it's the re-up

Shady
