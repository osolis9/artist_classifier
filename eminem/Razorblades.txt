Walking example of you. 
Just wait for the silence. 
Taking backwards to you, it meant nothing to me. 
Waching the world fall on you, I'm keeping my eyes closed. 
Now I can see what this means to you. 
It meant nothing to me.

Perfect timing for you to run until your legs break. 
So here's my reminder of you, it meant nothing to me.
