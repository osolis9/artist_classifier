Cause sometimes you feel tired, you feel weak,
then you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.
but you gotta search within you, find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you,
and get that motivation not to give up

And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your
face.and collapse

Till I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em, till the day,
that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' em
Cuz when I am not,
then I'ma stop pinnin'em and I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem

subliminal thoughts,

when Ima stop sendin' em, women are caught in webs,
spin 'em and hock venom, adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the
illin' to stop, amoxacillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin',
hip-hop villain a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it like I showed ya
the spirit of God lives in us
you hear it a lot, lyrics to shock.
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot listen up,
you bizzels forgot,
slizzel does not give a fuck

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out,
till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out,
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out, (Until the roof)
till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off)
Till the smoke clears out and my high burns out, (Until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.(Give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic,
there's a certain feeling you get
when you're real and you spit an people are feelin' ya shit
This is your moment
and every single minute you spend tryin' to hold on to it,

cuz you may never get it again
so while you're in it

try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
cuz I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in,
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outkast,
Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry,

I'm the cause of a lot of envy so when I'm not put on this list,
the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walkin' around like nothin's bothering me,

even though half you people gotta fuckin' problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you got to give me.
The press's wet dream like Bobby an Whitney Nate hit me...

Soon as the verse starts I eat it at MC's heart
What is he thinkin? I'ma have to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd, how ppl hang over every word
I'll probly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that'd be the death of me first
Cuz in my hardest heart I nothing could ever be worse,
that's y I'm clever
when I put together every verse
My thoughts, are as spurratic
I act like I'ma addict
I rap like I'm addicted to
Smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back
to constant battles
The fact, is I'd rather, sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack, I'm launchin at em'
The track is on some battle
And raps, who wants some static?
Cuz I don't really think the fact that I'm Slim matters
I'm black and platinum status
It's whack if I'm not the baddest

I, I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels Like no one, can, beat me
