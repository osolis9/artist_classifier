I don't know, man, just feels like we're a lot different
Kinda feels like we're on a whole different page right now
It feels strange but um, I guess it's kind of like, it's kind of like

I feel like I'm morphin' into somethin'
That's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphin's I effect

Your self-esteem shatters as dialect
Comes blastin' out your deck, she loves me
Such a passion, you'd expect this sort of reaction
From her yet

You strong arm, you're fuckin' corny
You try to turn your charm on
'Cause you just think you're Bishop, The Don Juan
But if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one

I'm cockin' my head back like Ed Lover, c'mon on, son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, "She's fuckin' with dude, she wants some"
Homeboy, you better get a clue, she's on my dick
'Cause she I spit better than you

What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closin' her eyes
Fantasizin' her diggin' her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction, yeah)

She's sittin' here gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot and you're not, aw

I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboys helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhymin' one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'Cause they're just not good enough but I'm not givin' up

'Til I get my respect and I won't stop 'til I get enough
'Cause I'm not livin' up to my own expectations, aw
That hater alarm is soundin' off, man
Obama took the bomb from my name, aw

So quit cryin' that I took your dame, homie, she's my dame, aw
You sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' that I'm not on my game, boy
And thangs just ain't been that same since that day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick ain't my dang fault, man, I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction, yeah)

It's like we're playin' lyrical tug-a-war with your ear
You hear it, girl, come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear
While I freak this world premier

Seducin' her, loosen up with a little freestyle that'll wait, am I losin' ya?
Am I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya
Homie, you're losin' her
Oh wait, you don't like it when I spit it fast, am I tryin' to show out?
Let me slow it down some

It's still gonna be a blow out
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
If you can save any of it, punk but none of it's fuckin' with me

Prick, you really feelin' that bullshit
You think you're killin' them syllables? Quit
Playin' these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
They call me Fire Mashall, I shut this shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round

I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awestruck
She's love stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suckin' my dick, aw, fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
(It's like a verbal seduction)
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction)

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(It's like a verbal seduction, yeah)
