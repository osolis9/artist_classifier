[Intro:]
[Eminem:] Tada-da-dadamm, tada-da-dadamm, tada-da-dadamm!*
[Lil' Wayne:] Young Money! Yeah!

[Hook: Sample from Haddaway's: "What Is Love" (Intro in the background)]
"Looove... "
"Don't hurt me... Don't hurt me... no more!
"Looove! "

[Lil' Wayne {Haddaway sample}:]
Uh! - Throw dirt on me. - And grow a wild flower,
But it's fuck the world - get a child out her!
Yeah, my life a bitch - but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back - I can show you vouchers! {Looove... }
I roll in sweets! - I'm smoking sour.
Married to the game - but she broke her vows.
That's why my bars - are full of broken bottles,
And my night stands - are full of open "Bibles"!
Ugh! - I think about more then I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat.
And these niggas know I lay 'em down make your bed,
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I break your leg!
Money out weighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script! - You niggas skipping scenes!
Ugh! - Be good or be good at it!
Fucking right I got my gun semi "Carter-matic"!
Yeah! - Put they dick in there mouth, so I guess it's fuck with they say,
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I come down in a couple of days!
Okay, you want me up in the cage? Then I'll come out in BEAST MODE!
I got this world stuck in a safe cominbation is the G code!
It's Weezy motherfucka, "Blood" gang and I'm in bleed mode,
All about my dough (door) but I don't even check the peep hole!
So you can keep knocking! - But won't lock me down!
No love lost! - No love found!

[Chorus: ~Eminem~ (Lil' Wayne) {Haddaway sample}]
It's a little too late - to say that your sorry now! (yeah!)
You kicked me when I was down,
But what you say just {hurt me} (That's right!) It don't {hurt me}
(I don't need you!) No more! (Don't wanna see you!) {No more} (Huh! Bitch you get) NO {Looove! }
You showed me nothing but hate (hahaa!) - you ran me into the ground,
But what comes around goes around (yeah, yeah!)
And you don't {hurt me! } (That's right!) You don't {hurt me! } (That's right!)
(And I don't need you) NO MORE! (Don't wanna see you! - Ha! Bitch you) GET NO...

[Bridge: Male sings (Lil' Wayne) {Haddaway sample}]
Loooooooooo-oooooove! - NOOO!
No loooooooooo-oooooove! - NOOO!
No loooooooooo-oooooove! - NOOO!
No loooooooooo-oooooove! - NOOO! (Ha! Bitch you get NO LOVE!)
No loooooooooo-oooooove! - NOOO!
No loooooooooo-oooooove! - NOOO!
No love! (And I don't need you!) {No more! } (Get 'em!)

[Eminem (Lil' Wayne):]
I'm alive again! - More alive then I have been in,
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah!) - see these people ears perk up as I begin,
A spaz with a pin! - I'm a little bit sicker than (I'm a little bit sicker than!)
Most! - Shit's gonna get thick again!
They say the - competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit now stick it in.
I ain't ever given in (I ain't ever given in!) again. (yeah!) - Caution to the win complete freedom!
Look at these rappers how I treat them; so why the fuck would I join them, when I beat them? ! (yeeah!)
They call me a "freak" cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them! (hahahah!)
Man, get these wack cocksuckers stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? ! (aahhh!)
Snatch the mic from them!
Bitch I'm a let you finish in a minute, yeah the rap was tight 
But I'm finished the greatest verse of all time
So you might wanna go back to the lab tonight, and I'm (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you was gonna spit an'
Start over from scratch and write new ones!
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip the 'stage' and tear it in half tonight, it's an adrenaline rush 
You feel the bass thump "from the place" all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd! (yeah!) - You can see the - sparks from hot metal! (yeah!)
Cold hearted
From the day I bogarted the game I soul started
A rock fellow (yeah!)
And I'm not even in my harshest you can see can get - roasted, cause Marshall's not mellow!
So on top, fill it from the top, I'm not gonna stop 'em - standing on my - Mono-poly board! (uh!)
That's means I'm on top of - my game, and it don't stop, till my hip don't hop anymore! (shit!)
When you so good, that you can't say it cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore, (shit!)
People just get sick cause you spit these fools drool and dribble a drop anymore! (OHHH!)
And you can't ever break my stride! (no!)
'You'll never slow the momentum at any moment but' I'm 'bout to blow!
You never take my pride! (you never take my pride!)
Killing the flow!
Slow venom and the opponent is getting no - mercy; mark my words!
And let enough relentless I smell blood!
I don't give a fuck! - Keep given them hell!
Where was you - when I fell and needed help up? - You get no love!

[Chorus: Eminem (Lil' Wayne) {Haddaway sample}]
It's a little too late - to say that your sorry now! (yeah!)
You kicked me when I was down,
But what you say just {hurt me} (That's right!) It don't {hurt me}
(I don't need you!) No more! (Don't wanna see you!) {No more} (Huh! Bitch you get) NO {Looove! }
You showed me nothing but hate (hahaa!) - you ran me into the ground,

And you don't {hurt me! } (That's right!) You don't {hurt me! } (That's right!)
(And I don't need you) NO MORE! (Don't wanna see you! - Ha! Bitch you) GET NO... [beat stops]
