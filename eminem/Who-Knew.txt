(I never knew I)
(I never knew I)
Mic check, one two
(I never knew I)
Who woulda knew?
(I never knew I)
Who'da known?
(I never knew I)

Fuck, what a story
(I never knew I)
Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I)
And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk, when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn 'em around

Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me, when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row
Screamin, "Go", with their seventeen year old uncle
I'm like, "Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked, if they liked violence?"

And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make up you allow, your twelve year old daughter to wear?
So tell me, that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
And 'Fuck' was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird

So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch, I never knew I'd

Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby de doo wop
Skibbedy be bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me?
And run up in the school shootin'
When they're pissed at a teach

Her, him, is it you, is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought?
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

How the fuck was I supposed to know?
