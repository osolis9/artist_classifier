[Eminem:]
Good evening. This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of 4 million and a half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
Please undo your seat belt for take off
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

[Dr. Dre:]
I'm Dre from back in the day from
N.W.A from black and the grey from
Chokin' a bitch to smacking her face from
Stackin' up bodies to racking their kids up from
Racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rap entertainment
Me and shady for us competition faggot there ain't none

[Em:]
Speak of the devil
It's the attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from
Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon the great one
Wait it ain't funny man, It's urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun
And a emergency squirtgun to spray everyone

[Chorus:]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you're now smoking with the best, the best)

I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you're now smoking with the best, the best)

[Em:]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless,
A nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound
I surround the hydrants taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and vicodin
Before I begin to get so high pussy boy I could spin
Vin vin, Fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch girls of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse if it's forced it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
When you wake in the morning next to the porcelain

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Dre:]
Now where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's fire there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

[Em:]
Nah-ah he ain't playing,
He's gonna get the AK and aim it at your brain
I'm slightly insane, Vodka and creatine
Hypnotic and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl you won't catch me CSI
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre. get on the mic and make them tremble and shake

[Dre:]
Now put your smoke up in the air
Raise your Henny and coke
And if you really want to get fucked up just let me know
We can smoke if there is no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You muthafuckers ain't smoking you just holding shit up
Now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one

Cause if at first you don't succeed
Won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing as how I blew up off puffing them trees

[Em:]
Was luck enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up cheech
Come on smoke me up cuz,
Get me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling Shady man come on back (what)
Man we're losing him, he won't even respond back fuck

Now look at all the pretty women in here (Dre: damn bitches)
Dre it's hot I think we better go check on their temperatures
I get the thermometer you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over this won't hurt a damn bit

[Repeat Chorus:]
