Ah yeah, yo!
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walking a tight rope without a circus net
I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
'Bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt

Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged, full of venom and rage
Especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, that's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer

Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders
These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
We'll all goin' to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinter's

While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hoping things will look up but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished

And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die we know were all going the same way

It's cool to be player but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man plus a luxury sedan
Too comfortable and roomy in a six
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics

Walk around depressed and smoke a pound of ses a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I'll end up burning in Hell scorching in flames

That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
Just lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems, now everybody on my blocks got 'em

I'm screaming like those two cops when Tupac shot 'em
Holding two Glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em

And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I never went gold of one song
I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom
When you feel like you have had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom
