If you relatin' let me hear ya say,  yay-yaay, yay-yaay

Bullets, they tear through
Got niggas wonderin' like, "What the fuck did I do?"

So niggas wanna go and get they man cause they can't do this shit
Because they ain't got no heart for this, bust a gun and body shit
Niggas like you probably snitch.. do a nigga then get rich
Niggas like you always fit,  6 feet deep inside a ditch

There ain't nothin' fuckin' with this, ya know why?

Ready to hold heat, drive-by with Rule
Poppin shots through the sun roof screamin' "Fuck You!"
