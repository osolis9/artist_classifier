yeahhh.
Come on...
18 yeah
If you feel like you've been touched
By the music that is...
Nowadays everybody just want to poke their nose
I've been on business, what is this? Some kind of joke?
Man everywhere I go, all I'm hearing is motto
What's up with Jay and Fat Jow?
Doing a song with old boy on the New York
man I thought you just [???] on song with a bow
Man the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass with a vow
I never had no ghetto pass you asshole,
You really wanna know, when I did leave in the ghetto
I catch your trespass and charge up at the railroad tracks,
So I suggest you get your faggots straight before you go
This is [??] to now
I ain't grow up in no trailer park because I was pow
Man this is my testimo
Me fo' those who don't know
Me feel like they do
Enough to feel compel, they gonna speak on me too
So this stick goes to you,
And this stick goes to you,

And if you feel like you want it than you can get it too,
And when you're through, pass it to the person next to you,
Hey yo Stat, get on the mic and come to spit a few
