Yo, same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go, same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance, somethin' about it, man
Same song and dance, 'In The Pale Moonlight'

I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, you're kind of tookin' back
By the whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard
Ya won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?

Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin' ya non-stop
I walk up on ya, well, "Hello Tonya
I think ya' got your OnStar button inside your car stuck"

You outta gas, do you got the flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back, why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front, I'm not askin', it's a trap

You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap
In broad day with no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't ever gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you

I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab, every four to six months

She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
And Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once
What an event it was, I was sittin' in front
I was hooked in it, the first glimpse of them buns

Seen her back stage, now here's where I come in, son
Look here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're lookin' a little thin, hun'
How 'bout a ride to rehab, get in, cunt

It's startin' off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kiddin', let me start over again, hun'
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension

You little wench, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With sixty six inches of extension cord

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't ever gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you

I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first burst upon the scene
And seen that the world was hers

She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad, it hurts
It irked me and made me mad at first
I lashed out through my songs but what was really goin' on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her

Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons
Of footage of me impalin' myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk

Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell like, "Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up"

Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feelin' you, Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent

I've been feelin' you, ooh, ooh girl, you sexy little gal
You hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
Come on, toots, give me the Valium alleyoop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke

And just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you
Shoot, now show me how you move, baby, do how ya do

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't ever gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you

I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance

Same kickin' and screamin', same cryin' and sobbin'
Same song and dance
Same diggin' and pleadin', same yellin' and bleedin'
Same song and dance
Yeah, same song and dance
I know, same song and dance
