Look, 
if you had one shot, 
or one opportunity 
to seize everything you ever wanted 
in one moment
 Would you capture it, 
or just let it slip? Yo...

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks runs out, time's up, over. Blow!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad 
But he won't give it up that easy, no, he won't have it 
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope 
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody,
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping 
This world is mine for the taking, make me king 
As we move toward a new world order 
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's 
Close to postmortem, it only grows harder, 
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over, 
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows, 
He's known as the globetrotter, lonely roads, god only 
Knows he's grown farther from home he's no father, 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose, 'cuz here goes the cold water 
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe, who flows he nose 
Dove and sold nada, so the soap opera 
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner 
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage 
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the 
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to 
Five and I can't provide the right type of 
Life for my family 'cuz, man, these goddamn 
Food stamps don't buy diapers and there's no movie, 
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life, 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter 
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got 
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot 
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not 
This may be the only opportunity that I got 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 

You better

You can do anything you set your mind to, man
