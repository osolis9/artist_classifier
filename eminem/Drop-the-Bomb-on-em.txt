Yeah boy, them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh my God, fucking bumbaclot, I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in the Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, you're nothin' but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal and charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch I'm like Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy you think you're Tom Sawyer
Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on you
Fuckin' fictional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourselves for Captain America on ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants para-sail
Or hit the trampoline, bounce, and grap a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothin', no, nada
Like your father fucking your mother

(Drop the bomb on 'em)
Please don't drop the bomb on me, Shady
Shady, please don't drop the bomb on me

(Drop the bomb on 'em)
I don't want no dog-gone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me

Boy, I'm the real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids

Party's over, kids kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre, the steel alloys, the rap crown royals
That scalp cowboys, now how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off and before you have a sound voyage
Sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R; and marinate in some marinara
And have a coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar of
Whip-ass on you, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star

Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God boy, you didn't go there, boy, you did not

I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy, Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin' ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot, when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop, and when it does, boy, there's a problem

Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, my name rings bells for itself

I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back better than ever, the cheddar shredder

The grater, the beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators, think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit? couldn't agree
With you more if you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady fucking Aftermath, boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank
