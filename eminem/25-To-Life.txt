Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

  (Yeah)
Too late
  (I can't keep chasing 'em)
(Taking my life away)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain

Bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart
And ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit

And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Paved for all the way this is how I fucking get repaid

Look at how I dress, fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left

But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept

Hows it feel now? Yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but its

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
'Til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
I cannot moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that

Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still, man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers, I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous

And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you 'oh
Now I'm special, ha, I felt special when I was with you

All I ever felt was this, helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch, chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get

Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I can't just walk away
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn in, so I guess, I'mma mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I'mma, ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss

You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip hop, I'm leaving you
My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a change, 25 to life

Too late
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
