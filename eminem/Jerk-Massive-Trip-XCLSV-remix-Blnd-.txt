Your a jerk
Oh my god it's massive, trip.
You bout to witness, hip-hop in its most purest
more rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but oh Doc is BACK
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
(*chainsaw sound* VROOM VROOM! Yeah, here I come
I'm inches, away from you, dear fear none

Hip-Hop is in a state of nine-one-one so.

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
when I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more; you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the ****
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
people when you're rappin and you know what for

The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
to Marshall and Andre's car-ni-val, c'mon! Now

So there you have it folks (Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre, here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
and never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time friends, same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh
