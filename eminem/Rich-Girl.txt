You're the kind of girl
Who can wear anything
And it looks like Versace
You're the kind of girl
That can make any car
Feel like a Maserati

You can turn anything into a diamond ring
Everything that you hold baby its solid gold
You're the kind of girl that should have anyone you want
But you want me

We don't need to be rich girl
To feel so money
To feel so money
When I'm kissing your lips girl
It feels so money
And we have everything in the world
Yeah we're rich girl

Woah woah woah woah
Rich girl
Woah woah woah woah
Rich girl

You're the kind of girl
Who'd be walking down the street
Looking like you're on a runway
You make hanging by the pool
Feel like we're at the beach on a million dollar getaway

You can turn anything into a diamond ring
Everything that you hold baby its solid gold
You're the kind of girl who could have anyone you want
But you want me

We don't need to be rich girl
To feel so money
To feel so money
When I'm kissing your lips girl
It feels so money
And we have everything in the world
Yeah we're rich girl

Woah woah woah woah
Rich girl
Woah woah woah woah
Rich girl

A Dollar and a dream
Can take us farther than you think
We're a money making team
Love is all we need

We don't need to be rich girl
To feel so money
To feel so money
When I'm kissing your lips girl
It feels so money
And we have everything in the world
Yeah we're rich girl

Woah woah woah woah
Rich girl
To feel so money
Woah woah woah woah
When I'm kissing your lips girl
And we have everything in the world
Yeah we're rich girl

Woah woah woah woah
Yeah we're rich girl
Woah woah woah woah
rich girl
You're the kind of girl
Who can wear anything
And it looks like Versace
Hanging by the pool
Feel like we're at the beach
On a million dollar getaway
