This Is My Time
[EMINEM]
"hey ..  yo...   "

[Chorus (2x)]
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..

[Verse]
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck 
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go


[Chorus (2x)]
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..

[OUT]
i am gonna fuck u up... 
This is my time, You all fuckers better get out ..
