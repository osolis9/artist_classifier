We The Realest Label



So let's get down to business 
I don't got no time to play around
What is this 
What is this
The invasion
green lantern
The infiltration
We com'in, yea
I got 50 Cent
I got G-U-N-I-T
D twizzy in this bitch wit Obie Trice
So watch what you say
fore you call our name
cuz you say one more thing
It wont be nice
oh here we go i shouldve known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it
G-UNIT made it
And OBIE comin D twizzi comin ur sick to ur stomach
50 percent of it is 50 Cent
the other 50 percent of its whose color of skin it is
but if u even consider
Takin our label down
you better find our building
and fly a fuckin plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get to intriquite into it
im just tryin to give u a little hint for ur own benefit
cuz thein its just gonna get to the point where it escalates into sum otha shit
them imma flip imma get'ta
STOMP in my Air Force Ones
Wont be able to tell if it's 2 pairs or one
its gonna feel like so many feet kickin you
thinkin that nike just made these innercleet tennis shoe
i dont know what it is or what it could be
but i get a woody when these pussies try to push me thinkin they gonna put me 
in a position to pickle me
y'all tickle me pink i think i just rather have Pink-Tickle-Me
hickory dickoty dock tickity tock tickity
a little bit of da dickity dock diggidy mixed wit a lil bit of the jig jocka 
jiggity
with a small pince of biggie look at me im just the bomb diggity

(CHORUS):
