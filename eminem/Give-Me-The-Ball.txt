Intro:
Ayo, let me tell you about my homies, haha

Verse 1:
my name is chauncey billups and im kinda like a raunchey phillips/
screwdriver, my crews live-er when you cant sleep
and youre still up. i get the ball and im like rip
you cant get a grip, you probably got stripped.
wanna rumble? no reason to trip
i grab it like gnarles barkley holds a mic
your snarles spark me,i smile like charles barkley
cmon im hard, gaurd me
aint doing it, persuiting no law suits
i aint suing, i know what im doing
give me the ball, your life is ruined
im like rasheed, i remind me of the spirit of proof
im happy-go-lucky, fall in a grove, and im on the move
im smoothe with it, give me the ball, you dont know what to do with it
shoot it in the basket, you other teams need a casket
lebrons said dont respond, theres no back-and-forth
this game is mental man, i play it loud, just walk away
and hush the crowd, you trying to touch? sit down


Hook:
DETROIT BASKETBALL

Homie like I told you this is...
DETROIT BASKETBALL
man I don't think you're ready...

Verse 2:
I get the crowd rolled up like a U-Haul truck
just call me two-balled Chuck
ain't too tall? What? I'll leave Utah stuffed
man I love this game, who the hell you called up
you need points on the paint, I'm --?--
all my ------?---------
yeah baby it's true, I'm talkin' to you
you already know what to do, just pass it to me
it just so happens to be that I adapt on this heat
so strap in your seat, I got a grasp on this beat
you ain't convinced? Give it to Tayshaun Prince
we haven't stay calm since, lead the ball with -? palm prints
Now homie this is (now homie this is)

Hook:
DETROIT BASKETBALL
Homie like I told you this is...
