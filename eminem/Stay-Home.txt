Haha
Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knives I like those
I might just go deep at the end of tonight's show
With the right dose I might wipe out with this light pole
But the strangest things can happen from jabbing pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches to slap up. and drastic ass kicks, gay bash and and fags with tired iron and ratchets
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Varsace Anarchy Might've asked somebody you probably know
But you faggets keep screamin' "It's not me, no!"
Drag 'em out the closet and across the floor
Wouldn't pay them a visit in the hospital
And stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils till it pops and goes skit and sit back and watch 'em choke

Cuz every chair that I throw
People sue me for those
They press charges on me
Till I can't fight anymore
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
So I suggest you stay home

Haha

It's time to play
