... Suck it to you
Here’s to … like a curtain, no relay
Keeps repeating myself what else can I say
You wondering why I act this way
I never should of gave you the time of day
Guess who ever time it is now

There must have been a gust of wind
Cause you change your mind every time it blows
And you just changed it the motherfucker can
You just said you just wanted some dick fore stuck in
I wouldn’t of been such a prick to you
Fuck em in, you say you don’t trust them
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushing?
Some shit is going down, you must of not been truthful from the start
See for me it bee nothing to see you never had my heart but I’d be lying
Fucking see why they call this bullshit a relationship
Cause Shit stink and you know it’s love as soon as you fall in it ...
And it feels every time I’m fucking you I get jinxed
Cupid must of put a curse on me,
6 weeks went by and we only spoke twice
I'm sitting in your driveway calling you from the car
Suffice I think it’s safe to say you’re not at home
I'm calling your cell phone, you answer
But I can tell though that you're not alone
How was I to know, it should have been time to go a long time ago
I kept holding on
It’s comical when I think back now I couldn't get the hint
You feel the draft, you were throwing I wasn’t catching your grip
But there’s a cold breeze blowing over me, I’m over you
Success is the best everything to pay you back
And when that payment is overdue I overcame ... to get even to sober me
Is shitting all over to un-sober you,
And I hope they play this at every club that you’re going to
I’m haunting you bitch, everywhere you turn, I’m following you
Cause I loved you, with every ...
You know is true is killing you now, yeah I hope the whole … is slowing you
Is cause of you now I don’t trust a man off fuck’em middle finger up
I’m gonna escape grabbing my paws couple I never fall again
I triple stairs I fall up but … don’t try to come back knocking on my door, or …
Cause I’m moving on, don’t worry about me, ***cause Imma be just fine without you*** , you’ll see
***there is no where in earth now I much rather be***
Cause god damn it I’m glad that I’m me

I said if you could be woman, you’d wanna be you too
If you felt the way I feel ***I bet you would be in a good mood a I am ***
But you don’t cause you just feel like you X 2

I had it for the last time, your actions got me high as my last rhyme
Your option are leave ... your ass fine, fine
This thing ain’t gonna cut it, drama is what you’re in love in
Human ambitions you ... lately I’m feeling smugglered
? to being covered, ...
Cause either will cover your motives, I got rise above it
You thinkin about arousing me, I’m thinkin about a dozen
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach told you I was going to ... you
You think I mean it, back to everything that I got, fuck you, ain’t no secret
No apologies, you keep it
Not that I’m doing my thing and you peep it
The …all I need a reason, the energy who needs it?
Every rumor that you hear you go believe it
Pull out the towns you seen it, you stabbed me, should of leaned it
Revenge is mine, I need it either way out
It’s my fucking life, better find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I break it ain’t that easy
Bet you thought I’d need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
? get your coat and go, the female Pinocchio
Money hungry, hopeless how you fucking with my focus so
Go back to that job they pay you ...
Love is like a cancer when you don’t let go
I’ma put the show, not necessary witness to vocal so
I don’t need you sinkin this, hope you float
Lying through my teeth I hope you don’t drown
Another ... that’d be dope, bottles pop I really smoke
Hit me and proud that we broke
... if they got something to show
Let them show me how in love … never even left a scar, you fell hard, I’m laughing, hahaha
Tire smoke, fancy cars, nothing is what we are, no beginning no tomorrow
Cause I’m moving on, don’t worry about me, cause I’m a biggest
... without you, you’ll see
Everyone knows earth right now how much rather be
Cause god damn it I’m glad that I’m me

I bet if you could be where im at, you’d wanna be you too
If you felt the way I feel I bet you be in as good a mood as i am
But you don’t cause you just feel like you

I said if you could be woman, you’d wanna be you too
If you felt the way I feel I bet your being is good a mood design
But you don’t cause you just feel like you
I said if you could be woman.
