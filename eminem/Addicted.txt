Addicted
I heard you're doin' OK, 
But I want you to know
I'm addic-
I'm addicted to you
I can't pretend I don't care 
When you don't think about me
Do you think
I deserve this?
I tried to make ya' happy
But you left anyway

I'm tryin' to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it
And I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never
Wanna do this again

Since the day I met you
And after all we've been through
Still addic,
I'm addicted to you
I think you know that it's true
I'd run a thousand miles to get you
Do you think I deserve this?
I tried to make you happy
I did all that I could
Just to keep you 
But you left anyway

I'm tryin' to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it
And I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never
Wanna do this again

How long will I be waiting?
Until the end of time
I don't know why I'm still waitin'
I can't make you mine

I'm tryin' to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it
And I need it
I'm addicted to you

I'm tryin' to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it
And I need it
I'm addicted to you

Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never
Wanna do this again
