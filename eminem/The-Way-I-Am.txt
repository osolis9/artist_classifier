Whatever, Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully
(Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
(Speak to me)

I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
(Is on empty)

No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet in the air
(Liftin' you 10 feet)
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
(Of all you)
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song
'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
(Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
(On Marilyn)

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now, it's a tragedy
Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin' this happenin'
(This happenin')

Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
(Rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is"

And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
(Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk

With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin'
The same fuckin' questions
(Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who what when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
(Drivin' me crazy)
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
