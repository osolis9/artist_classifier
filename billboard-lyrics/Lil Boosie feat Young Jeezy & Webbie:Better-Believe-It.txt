Brick on top of brick yeah
I layed my foundation and I built my house
And it was mixtape after mixtapes and next thang you know
I was running the South Streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running the world
Who u thank he is bitch one of the girls jeezy
See ya ass in dem jeans make you one of tha girls
I'm a super nigah need a cape for me

Real street niggas can relate to meh
Big disappointment I would hate to be
At the wrong palce at the wrong time
Wrong line, wrong name, right car but the wrong thang

Can't tell me shit I'm a grown mane
16 years ole with a old thang
Same clothes for days, same spot for months
2 aks and a box of blunts

If money you want then it's money you get
Hanging with rite blow den it's money you get
Ever beleive that I'd ever believe that I'd ever achieve what I ever achieve
Stop this bitch let me tell the world some

From the bottom to the top shoulda seen that shit
Me and my lil nigga thugged it from the mud
Every thang I spit I really mean that shit
It's crazy ain't it hard to explain and I done got famous
All I did was bring it
Savage life behind the mic now everybody hollin out trill entertainment
Rest in peace pimp c I scream that shit everytime I do shows
You put me on and I ain't forget so for my nigah I gotta fuck two hoes
Whateva ya'll mean I ain't got green
Jus cus you see me in the hood don't thank I can't leave
When I was 19 already had a whole deal
Ya'll other lil niggas ya'll jus selling ya'll dreams
I ain't through yet I done it all
But I got a lot of stuff I even do yet
I fucked up I ain't make it through school
I'm a see if my kids goin make it thru that
From Miami to LA back to Manhatten where the big cake
From Baton Rouge I done did it goin head admit it I'm a the shit hey
And I don't care what a bitch say
I'm a be like this till I get gray and I ain't puttin' no rims on it
When it 500 hundred to ride factory
The new album is on the way this the real deal so you know you gotta wait
Bad azz goin act a dawg ass and ya'll already know that
