X gon' give it to ya
Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own
X gonna deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop and stainless steel

Go hard gettin' busy with it, but I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right and I'll do it again
'Cuz I am right so I goes to win

Break bread wit the enemy
But no matter how many cats I break bread with
I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved
Bitch and that's on a light day

I'm gettin' down, down, maken niggas say freeze
But won't be the one endin' up on his knees
Bitch please
If the only thing you cats did is come out to play
Stay out my way
Motherfucker

Ain't never gave nothin' to me
But every time I turn around
Cats got they hands out wantin' something from me
I ain't got it so you can't get it
Let's leave it at that cuz I ain't with it

Hit it wit full strength, I'm a jail nigga
So I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever nigga
Fuck you gon' do?

I'm a wolf in sheep clothing
Only nigga that you know who can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears

I put in work and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is
(Uh-huh!)
They don't know who we be
Lookin', but they don't know who they see nigga

First we gonna ROCK, then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, DON'T LET IT GO
X gonna give it to ya

Shout out to niggaz that done it
And it ain't even about the dough
