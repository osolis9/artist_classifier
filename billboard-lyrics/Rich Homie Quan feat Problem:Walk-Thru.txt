Walk-Thru:Rich Homie Quan feat Problem:20:2014-09-06

Yeah, hey man where my real niggas at in this muh' fucker man?
You feel me? Do the real nigga walk through for me hey

I be feeling like the man when I walk through
Ain't stunting what you saying when I walk through
I got all these hoes staring when I walk through
I done made a few bands when I walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
I done made a few bands when I walk through

I done made a few bands when I walk through
People I don't know naw I don't talk to
Me and Problem in this bitch, he a boss too
Sitting at the round table making boss moves
I done walk thru with Gucci on my feet
Who got more money, you or me?
I'mma walk through usually with my nigga best believe
That I got the tool on me I done snuck passed security
What the fuck, do you need glasses just to see
Me when I'm coming full speed, got that V12 running
And I'mma jump the fence if I see 12 coming
Even if I were blind, I could still smell money
I can't trust no outside niggas, they could tell on me
I'm the alphabet boy â€˜cause I keep an L on me
I smoke good, throwing up my set in your hood, nigga

I be feeling like the man when I walk through
Ain't stunting what you saying when I walk through
I got all these hoes staring when I walk through
I done made a few bands when I walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
I done made a few bands when I walk through

It's money over here, what you thought, clown?
Play crazy while you high, have you knocked down
No frowns around here, bruh, we all smiles
Giuseppe just dropped, got all styles
(Mom set the boy out when I walk through
Scarface before he died this part 2)
Have your peoples tell promoters that I'm coming
Park me in the front, leave the shit running, here's 100, what up?
Flip your bitch like a coin, better call it, nigga
She got a thing for us big dick balling niggas
She bout to rock the boy mic, 'till it feedback
The realest nigga out my city and I mean that

I be feeling like the man when I walk through
Ain't stunting what you saying when I walk through
I got all these hoes staring when I walk through
I done made a few bands when I walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
Watch me, watch me, hey, watch me walk through
I done made a few bands when I walk through
