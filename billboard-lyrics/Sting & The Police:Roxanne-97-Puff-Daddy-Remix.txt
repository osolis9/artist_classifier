Roxanne-97-Puff-Daddy-Remix:Sting & The Police:5:1998-03-07

Yeah ye ye yeah yeah
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Sting, Bad Boy remix come on
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Hey yo shake what ya mama gave you is her motto
Pour out the bottle, blow out the candle
Too broke to hold, too shallow to handle
Get all today you never promised tomorrow

Yeah, her moves remind me of Kung Fu flicks
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Thick lips that contradicts
Rules of the game, she plays the politics
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Red light special, red light district

Put on ya make up body all made up
Platinum played up, Pearl Jam cut up
Roxanne, Roxanne you don't really have to
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue

She got the hots for the disco jocks
Rock ya socks at the pop of the tops
Never get cool like to call it Glock
Twisted minded like Bob Zealot

Roxanne
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Yo what's the haps girl, dancing for the green paperback
Sitting at the bar drinking up Cognac
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
She steps in the room, don't know how to act
Sweet in emergence, similar to Similac

It was the hat, cats wanna be around her shine
She wants to party, have a good time
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
She feels kind of hot me feelin', feelin' fine
Diggin' all her life just to get a gold mine
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Bro making the streets, she's the pimper's paradise
Jewels around her neck getting strong with the ice
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
She said I heard of ya crew I'm the number one fan
Of the refugees down from the islands

Driving the Bentleys with her pretty pretty friends
Sippin' colada every day is a weekend
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Heard your name was Pras outta Brooklyn
And fifteen million place with your total sound scan

I loved you since I knew you
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have you to tell just how I feel
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
I won't share you with another boy

I know my mind is made up
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
So put away your makeup
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Told you once I won't tell you again
It's a bad way

Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
You don't have to put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on the red light
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Put on the red light
I wanna be your man
