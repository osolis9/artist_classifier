Suicidal-Failure:Cage:8:2001-02-03

Remember how good things used to be?
(Although I seem and appear)
Remember how good things, everything used to be?
(To the naked eye, to be normal)

It used to be just so good
It used to be just me and this girl
(Yeah, right)
Pull out my naked eye and with this
Wrap it, my mask of sanity is about to slip

Sittin' in my room with a razor blade
Thinkin' all my days are played
As much as my single needs to fade away
Shoot myself in the arm and start bleedin', don't wanna go yet
Stick a straw in my wound and taste my heart beatin'

Fuckin' bitch left me and I ain't even peaked yet
Fuck all that noise, the playboy, this leak's wet
Smoke a bundle to the face, lace my brain and neurons
Carvin' all my downfalls into my fuckin' forearm

Cage snap out of this, it's just a girl
It's just the world, it's just a life
It's just a rusty Rambo knife
Wedge between my ribs
Scratchin' my heart up tonight

I'm gonna pull that shit off in front of all my friends
Went swimmin' under the Brooklyn Bridge tryin' to catch the bends
Didn't swim deep enough, my head imploded 10%
Floated to the surface, the paramedic's like, "What's this stench?"
(Holy shit)
"Alright everybody back off, it's still alive"

I'm a suicidal failure
Look, my life's a failure
I can't make it in rap
Even my birth's an error
Do what I can to catch a quick death
But I'm meant to be here
And that's the fuckin' hell I live with

I'm a suicidal failure
Look, my life's a failure
I can't make it in rap
Even my birth's an error
Do what I can to catch a quick death
But I'm meant to be here
And that's the fuckin' hell I live with

Took the phone off the hook, eight multi-colored pills
Washed it down with Absolut, started writin' out my will
Give my dog, Bootlegs, pierce to in D.C.
To my girl who left me when she said, "Pick me, I'm PCP"

Since I love to smoke, I thought it was a joke
Tried to hang myself  and I fell free from the rope
Broke my both my arms, my neck, smashed my femur
Got up somehow and limped in from of a Beamer
Cracked my rib cage

"Look what you did Cage, you're dying"
But I'm not dead yet, I'm still tryin'
Cut my wrists and walked pass some Crypts bleedin' red
In hopes I'd get shot in the fuckin' head

I'm a suicidal failure
Look, my life's a failure
I can't make it in rap
Even my birth's an error
Do what I can to catch a quick death
But I'm meant to be here
And that's the fuckin' hell I live with

I'm a suicidal failure
Look, my life's a failure
I can't make it in rap
Even my birth's an error
Do what I can to catch a quick death
But I'm meant to be here
And that's the fuckin' hell I live with

I drank a bottle of Jack, sniffed three bottles of Kitty
In the middle of the freeway, walkin' to the city
So much PCP I changed my name to Watermouth
Pumpin' [unverified] I walked into a Jewish slaughterhouse

Threw myself on a hook
(Now that's a chorus)
Got split from my neck to my dick
(Now that's what poor is)

Hollow man look at all my dangling parts
Drop into the gutter with a piece of you on my heart
Little piece of shit that I couldn't fling from my chest
Shoulda stayed a lot long enough to kill the faggot with

But right now my skin is gettin' stripped off
Each one of my limbs is stripped off
Covered in thick sauce, my head hits the conveyor
I'm not thinkin' of prayer, that's sick

I'm watchin' the movie at Laurie's alone
And you suckin' some guys dick
Six seconds left, when I die I'm gonna find her
On some poltergeist shit
While my face goes through the grinder

I'm a suicidal failure
Look, my life's a failure
I can't make it in rap
Even my birth's an error
Do what I can to catch a quick death
But I'm meant to be here
And that's the fuckin' hell I live with

I'm a suicidal failure
Look, my life's a failure
I can't make it in rap
Even my birth's an error
Do what I can to catch a quick death
But I'm meant to be here
And that's the fuckin' hell I live with
