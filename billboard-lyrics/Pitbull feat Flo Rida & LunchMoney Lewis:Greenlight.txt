Greenlight:Pitbull feat Flo Rida & LunchMoney Lewis:24:2016-12-17

Mister 305!
(Flo-Rida and Lunch Money!)
Three Miami boys, you know what time it is…
Give me the greenlight, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for you
You only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
Give me the greenlight, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Give me the green light…!
I got the greenlight mami and you know what that means
That we could do anything, anything that you dream
I wanna make you ooh, ah, until you scream
And I practice what I preach, if you know what I mean
I'mma ride that mami, yeah I got the key and I'mma lock that mami
Yeah, we can roll and I'mma rock that mami
I do what I say and say what I mean, now let me jump in between
I'm getting loose in this thing, like OJ the Juice in this thing
Feeling like Left Eye, boy, I burn the roof in this thing
I got all the women getting naked, feeling like Luke in this thing
Think it's a game
Now I got the weed lit and the green right
All I need is mami for you to give me the greenlight
So I can run through it like an easy pass
Find the G-spot and step on the gas

Give me the greenlight, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for you
You only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
Give me the greenlight, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Give me the green light…!

Baby, I got the Midas, I'm Flo-Rida
You know I'm all about that thing
If she ready then I'm ready
Pull up on her with the Chevy
Real talk when that light turn green
(Let go)
Give me what I ask for, I got a passport
Mister international, I hit the airport
If you knew the kind of work that I transport
That Rihanna do me dirt to the crash course
I like to clean this, lean this
I fly to Venus, Flo a Genius, Phoenix
You've never seen this, I have a dream this
That 200 on the dashboard, got me fiending
So I'm tryna ride out, hide out
Tide these stripes, indie 500, vibe out
Whyl out, shot out
Beehive, hit the honeycomb
Give me the greenlight
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time
What you waiting for you
You only got one life
And we gon' live it up
Give me the greenlight, let's go
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
(Right now, right now)
Give me the greenlight
Redlight, greenlight
Everybody take a shot
Redlight, greenlight
Give me everything you got
Redlight, greenlight
Everybody take a shot
Redlight, greenlight
What you waiting for?
Give me the greenlight, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for you
You only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
Give me the greenlight, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
(Right now, right now…)
(Give me the green light…!)
