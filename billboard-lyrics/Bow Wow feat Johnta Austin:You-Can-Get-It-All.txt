Shawtie you can get it all

I know you heard my reputation
You dont think i would ever do right by you
You think that if you and i was in a relationship
I would never be true (be true)
You think that anything i say is straight gang
and to me your just another new name
But what im tryna tell you for every man
theres a woman that'll make him change
And i believe you the one that'll make me
but any time i try to show you you shake me
I know i make it real hard for you to take me serious
but baby girl i am (i am)
And i aint stoppin right here, ima keep going
And im gona make sure everyday tat you keep knowing
Weather if i have to send you flowers
or talk to you on the celle-phone for few hours
im yellin like.

Wooo-hooo
And when i think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind.
Im like
wooo-hooo

(One, one, one, one)
One minute you act like you like me
and then the next you dont
You still sending me crazy emails
Like i know its just sex you want
I cant lie the sex is truly incredible
And every part of your body is so edible
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that aint the reason why im stuck and cant let you go
We got a serious serious bond
And when we kick it we have nothin but fun
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me
even though we still young
Just your company aint gota get none
Talk the same lingo, understand where im coming from
and if anybody ask me a question about you
ima tell em you the one
You got me like

As long as you know that

Baby that sexual infectual
