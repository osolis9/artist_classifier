Where-Is-The-Love-:The Black Eyed Peas:19:2003-08-02

Manchester make some noise for the Black Eyed Peas, c-mon!
Whassup? What's up London!
We're showin' love to Manchester and London right now
Put your hands in the air in the name of love
Hey!

What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, (The big CIA)
Hey, the Bloods and The Crips and the KKK

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight (Here we go!)
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Where's the love y'all)

Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love Manchester? (I don't know)
Where's the love London? (I don't know)
Where's the love

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (Love)

Where is the love y'all? (The love)
Where is the love man? (The love)
Where is the love y'all? (The love)
Where is the love man?(The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema

Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity

That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes (That's it)
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

The love, the love, the love,
Where is the love, the love, the love?
The love, the love, the love,
Where is the love, the love, the love?

Manchester we love you!
Manchester! London!
We are here and we are together and we are one
Put one finger in the air!
If you're about oneness, togetherness,
Put one finger in the air!

We only got one love, one love
We only got one love, one love
That's all we got, one love, one love
That's all we got, one love, one love (Hey!)
One love, one love (C'mon)
One love, one love

Ey! We love every single one of you
Thank you so much Ariana for this
I wanna show appreciation for the mayor of London
The mayor of Manchester, the police force in Manchester
The police force here in London
And all these people who came for Love
Who will not be separated.
If you know the words to this song I want you
To help us out and sing along
C'mon everybody!
Big love everybody (Big love)
Big love everybody (Big love)
C'mon we saying

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

The love, the love, the love,
Where is the love, the love, the love?
The love, the love, the love,
Where is the love, the love, the love?
