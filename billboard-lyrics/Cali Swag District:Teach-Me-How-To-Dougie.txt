Aye, aye
Teach me how to dougie
Aye

They be like, "Smoov?" "What?"
"Can you teach me how to dougie?"
You know why? 'Cause all the bitches love it
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin'
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dub it

Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that dougie, right?
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit that dance with thunder

I ain't from Dallas, but I D-town boogie
I show my moves off, and everybody tryna do me
I leave the functions, and all the ladies tryna screw me
You just do you, and I'm a do me

Niggas love to hate, so they try to shot me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they tryna glue me
I make the party shine bright when it start to bloomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

My name is Yung for them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the west, but I can teach you how to dougie
I step up in the club, and all these bitches bug me
All them niggas dancin', and none of them know me

I hear this crowd screamin' like, "Aye, get it Brody"
So I move my shoulders, and I take it real low
They like, "How we do that? He can dougie on the floor"
And when that nigga stop they like, "Dougie some more"

I'm like a nigga kinda tired, so I pass it to the bro
M-Bone, show these cats how to do that
Down south dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And bought it to the hood and got the whole crew askin'

Back at the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone
She do her dougie and all them bitches hate her
But I'm 'bout to escape with a bitch and head home

She got her fans, so it's a two man hand
And I run it even if her legs long
She like you, hubby, I think she love me
But I change the subject, and I do my dougie

'Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me Smoov, her fender back like Playboy bunnies
We gon' make us do the dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head, this bitch looked at me funny

Bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Star baked the beat, and I just took it out the oven
I just hit the dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans 'cause the burner keep rubbin'
