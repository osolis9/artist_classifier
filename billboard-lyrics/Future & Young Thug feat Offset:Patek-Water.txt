Patek-Water:Future & Young Thug feat Offset:12:2017-11-11

Go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
Southside
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back, don't go back

Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Link water)
Ayy, what kinda shooter is jumpin',
splash the water (Thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Boy, you rocking a prime set, 40 partners
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh Yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh Yeah)
Tryna get me head, ayy, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh Yeah)
Feed a bitch addys, wrist so lavish (Let's go)

I'm a young gunner, young gunner, young gunner, a nigga just wet up
We don't got no time for these boys, just shut up and bet up
The Rollie on Ric Flair, my wrist is just wet up (Whoo)
The plug just called like "What up?", nigga don't let up (Let's go)
The diamonds are yellow the day, you gotta catch up, yeah
Money on the floor with these hoes,
these niggas can't pose with us (Can't pose, no)
How the fuck you sound old, you never grown with us
Diamonds in the ear got big,
look nigga, I told you (They dripping wet)
Flood that Patek [??] and throw her that straw (Throw her that straw)
All these bitches digging with a golden shovel
Secret service, they taking me through the side door (Side, let's go)
And I promise I can fold with a blindfold

Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Link water)
Ayy, what kinda shooter is jumpin',
splash the water (Thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Boy, you rocking a prime set, 40 partners
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh Yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh Yeah)
Tryna get me head, ayy, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh Yeah)
Feed a bitch addys, wrist so lavish (Let's go)

[??] on the edge of my neck, I never settle for less (Nah)
Put her on perky and act, I'ma just fuck and forget (Smash)
Mansion that sit on the hill, after my last arrest
Niggas out here in the field, don't need a mask or vest (Brr)
Ah, back to back Lambos, repeat it,
you like to run when it's heated (Run)
Back to back AR-15 with the cooler, just in case it get heated
Hop on the wave and drown, my momma [??] cartier bracelet (Momma)
Ah, face it down, dirty in my soda, I hate the brown (Uh)
Hold it down 'cause the plug is illegal
Ridin' 'round with a dub and a eagle (Brr)
I heard that money get evil,
prayin' to god to keep me from demons (God)
She lost in the vibe surrounded by
stars, we got her sucking on semen (Ugh)
You gotta survive and sparing no lives
F&N; pop at your beanie (Ayy)

Ayy, what kinda water is that? It's Patek water (It's Link water)
Ayy, what kinda shooter is jumpin',
splash the water (Thu thu thu thu thu thu thu thu)
Ayy, what kinda whip is that? It came imported
Boy, you rocking a prime set, 40 partners
Nigga, we changing whips out like new Jordans (Oh Yeah)
Way ahead of yourself, you done outdid yourself (Oh Yeah)
Tryna get me head, ayy, pull up in a red Wraith (Oh Yeah)
Feed a bitch addys, wrist so lavish (Let's go)

We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We just wanna go snatch a nigga's sunroof
We don't wanna go back to what we been through
We don't wanna go back, don't go back
