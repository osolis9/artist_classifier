Welcome-To-My-Hood:DJ Khaled feat Rick Ross, Plies, Lil Wayne & T-Pain:14:2011-05-07

DJ Khaled, Cash Money on money
We're the best
Welcome to my hood
Where the hood at?
Where the hood at?
Where the hood at?
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody
And if I got it, everybody got it, oh
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevy's
24s so you know we roll heavy, oh
Welcome to my hood
They outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood
Them boys will put you down on your knees
Woop, woop
That's the sound of the police in my hood
