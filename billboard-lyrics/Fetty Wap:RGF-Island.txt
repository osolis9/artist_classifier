My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas cause I got 'em
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas, Zoo I got 'em

On everything, for 17im wildin
Treat my whole squad on an island
Ziploc gang, bring a lighter
It's gon' be a house party on this island
Shit boom like M80s on this island
It's a lot of trillionaires throwin' dollars
Cause I'm pure hell, wildin' out on this island
I do this too swell, my pockets too swell
Come try the 100 gang and they'll shoot ya
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
It's Zoovier from the trap and ain't a damn thing change
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas cause I got 'em
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas, Zoo I got 'em
