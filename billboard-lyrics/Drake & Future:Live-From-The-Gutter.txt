Hendrix
Yeah, aqua, ah

(I woke up like this)
Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talking bout' some real money shit

I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit

I ain't talking nothin' but big money, bitch
Reporting live from the gutter
I'll buy this motherfucker, talking big money shit, bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talkin' 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears still fallin' now on my last bitch
This money made me hungry, I'm a savage
I've seen stars lining up, you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ha
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ha
Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked outside of Buford, came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I leave it though
Came out clean, I ain't clean my nigga still there
Just imagine you was living lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pool's sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's what keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just pay they bills now

Money make em' feel good but does she make me feel good?
Known for gettin' that guala out in Europe but I'm still hood

Known to pop a bottle on a mothafucka' like I'm on my last damn dollar, ha

Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talking bout' some real money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit

I ain't talking nothin' but big money, bitch
Reporting live from the gutter, I will buy this motherfucker
It's not even a discussion (whoop)
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dipping with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her tripping off of the yaya
Pillow talking dishing out on all y'all, yeah
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what's coming
Live from the gutter dog, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it dog, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks (whoop)

And we gon' miss you
They don't want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta' live through
But these the times we gotta' live through, and I'm...
Reporting live from the fucking gutter, bitch
I ain't talking bout' some real money shit
Reporting live from the damn gutter
Swear to god I'll buy this motherfucker, ah
