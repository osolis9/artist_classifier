I made love to a stripper (stripper), first I had to tip her (phrrr)
20 thousand ones, (woo) she said I'm that nigga (I am)
I said I'm that nigga, bitch, I already know it (I know it)
I come with bad weather, (ksh) they say I'm a storm (ayy)
VVS in my chum, that's a Roc-A-Fella chain
I was sendin' bricks to Harlem back when Jay was still with Dame
I'm a Phillipe Chow, (what?) I got a Patek on (okay)
Got a stripper with me, she pick up the check, home (phrrr)
She gon' fuck it up, fuck it up, she don't need makeup (makeup)
She gon' rake it up, rake it up until a nigga pay up (pay up)
She said pay for the pussy, pay for the pussy (pay), wait for the pussy, wait for the pussy (wait)
Ask God to forgive me (why) 'cause I pray for the pussy, pray for the pussy

I don't date honey, (no?) cookie on tsunami (oh)
All my niggas wife me once they get that good punani (oh)
I think he need a Bonnie, I might just let him find me
Never trust a big butt and a smile, word to Ronnie
Re-rep Queens like Supreme, ask Webb and Nitti
Ask Bimmy and Joe, nigga run me my dough
Wr-wrist game is freezin' like it wait in the cold
Nickname is Nicki but my name ain't Nicole (grrr)

Well, I'm the dough boy, the one they talkin' about
All these gossipin' ass niggas got my name in they mouth
I know the bad bitches but know niggas who bitches too
They should bleed once a month 'cause that's what these bitches do
You a bitch and ya bitch should expose you
All that pillow talkin', nigga, that's what the hoes do
You a bitch, word to my nigga, Short
We won't never write no statement, we ain't showin' up in court
Bitch, we don't do no gossipin', we don't do no arguin'
We don't beef on social sites, we just hit our target
We don't do no rumors, we don't don't pay no shooters (rumors, brrr)
You a little bitty bitch, you should work at Hooters (yo)
You a old hater, you a fuckin' cougar
You a bitch and he a bitch and y'all like twin sisters
Respect ya hustle, get ya money, baby, win with us
Ya boyfriend actin' like a bitch then why you still with him?



I tell all my hoes: rake it up
Break it down, bag it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, back it up, back it up
Rake it up, rake it up, back it up, back it up
I tell all my hoes: rake it up (what?)
Break it down, bag it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, rake it up, rake it up (fuck it up, rake it up)
