Blow-A-Bag:Future:22:2015-08-08

Yeah
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
I woke up like fucking up this paper
Freebandz, Freebandz

I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy

I blow a bag today, I bought a whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, shawty gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi

I had a bag today, I blow the bag today
I had to grab the Wraith, I had to grab the Wraith
I had to change the safe, I had to change my bitch
Money'll change a nigga, the fame'll change a bitch
I know I came from poverty, I got my name from poverty
I know for sure, for sure
If my Granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Snupe was livin', I know he'll be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Lonzo was livin', he never would've doubted me
I know for sure, for sure
I live with these diamonds, just check out my clarity
Gotta just check out these clarity
I guess I just feel like a parachute
I pull up right now and embarrass you
I sold the crack on my avenue

Only the strong survive
I'm just enjoying my life

I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, I bought a whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today

I blow a bag today, shawty gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi

I ran it up with the same niggas
Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell out of dope at the apartments, I did it
I'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't wit me
Runnin' with niggas
That wanna see niggas that get it and niggas to strive
And the real niggas is all they come across yeah
I know either way it goes, Sonny gon' be there

I know either way it goes, Bubba gon' be there (Young Metro!)
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there
I be pourin' up this 4, they thought we wouldn't be here
I told you come to town, we have to persevere
I knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here

I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, walk in the mall and go crazy

I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, I bought a whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, shawty gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
