In-My-Life:Juvenile feat Mannie Fresh:13:2004-04-17

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Lil' children, dogs and cats
Right now, you are listening to the incredible drum patterns of
DJ Mannie fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh

Ladies and gentlemen
I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got a lot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got alot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca-cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

It's ya nigga Juve, from the Magnolia, still lookin'
You ho's gon' know what's up with me bust it wide open
Loose chest, loose booty round down and up
If a gangsta can't touch it, what you bouncin it fo'
Now give me leway, watch how a G play
Watch how my name get caught up in the he and she say
It's U.T.P. day, we with the streets may
They represent us when they hear us at the DJ's

Break bread with me nigga, demand with me
Though we was beefin', your supposed to spend your cash with me
I'm in here last with me, hold me down, give me a whip, give me
A trick and let her blow me down
I'm so gutter, I'm so slick, I'm so grimey
I promise you somethin', I bet you gon' find me
I'm a eat, purchase, whatever I please
C.O. give me the keys, aw please, I need two of these

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got a lot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got alot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

I'm a be so courageous and so contagious
Until' my fuckin' rap sheets gonna receive mo' pages
Listen to Juve 'cuz this my year mon'
(My year mon')
Invision, I'm bout to kick it in here mon'
(In here mon')
Don't you see the soldiers and bauds when I appear mon'
(Appear mon')
About being written on my face 'cuz I know fear non'
(Fear non')
Me and my team got a scheme to go light the block up
Skips movin' work and wacko poppin' the chopper

I scream the 'U' 'cuz I mean it
The only difference is you be throwing your set up when you screamin'
I seen it, shit all of the obstacles that I've been through
Who made you think I'm a be scared of a bitch like you
I'm ya dog, let me get it all consign me
You ain't paid them last people yet, dog don't even remind me
I gain knowlege, my game polished, and it's obvious
You can't block it, you can't knock it, this is profit

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got a lot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got a lot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

Can I untape the clips and chill?
Show my clicks it's real, can my people shop in Beverly hills?
I got alot of work I know thats gonna be ahead of me still
But my peace mentality gon' keep me ahead in the field
Pardon me, but I got paper to chase
Now cut thru the talkin' and bring me straight to the safe
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroyin' the tape
I'm not leaving no evidence for the forensics to trace

I had a problem on my hand, a few bills I had been payin'
I figured about a lil'bit less than 75 grand
And my dog Rocky, caught a nickel for a pistol
It's serious when the federales comin' to get you
Life is at a standstill, all change in this damn field
What you say, can get you and ya man's killed
This my last chance to come up, this gotta be it
Juve comin' up, the first round' lottery pick

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got a lot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got a lot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life
