Like-That:Jack & Jack Featuring Skate:25:2015-02-07

I ain't never met a girl, like you
And you'll never find a man, like me
Walking out the door, with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want

Got me goin mad, when you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap when you act like that (Yeah)
I ain't even mad when you dress like that (Skate)
I know you know you bad when you act like that

Oh yeah

Met a bad betty from the state of Mississippi
Really pretty and I wanna take her home to see the city
Doin ya thing, got me insane
Walking in the mall you cop me a chain
I was like damn
you hot as a flame.
Yo momma's the only one that you can blame
You so cute, girl, yeah you is a blessing
And I'm the reason that your boyfriend keep flexing
Never stop texting everytime I see your name up in my phone
I'm just picturing ya body with that dress and make up on
You don't even need the makeup
save that shit for later
you the baddest thing I've seen I'm thanking yo creator
Girl, I see you working like Miley Cyrus be twerkin
I'm certain you'll be screamin for me when I close the curtains
But it's funny, cause I'm the one thats screamin out for ya baby
I been messin around with too many girls, I need a lady
Hopin you can be the one but you need to show it
and if you prove it to me girl, all this money, we'll blow it

I ain't never met a girl, like you
And you'll never find a man, like me
Walking out the door, with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want

Got me goin mad, when you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap when you act like that
I ain't even mad when you dress like that
I know you know you bad (Ok) when you act like that (Hah) (Get it)

Walked up in the spot, we do this a lot
Livin at the top, pretenching you c'mon
Let's pop a bottle, good God
Look at what we got
Double take like a stop sign
I thought I would be done with all of this stuff
But shit, I guess not
I'm tryin to get at you
Trust me I'm not yo average individual
Yeah, I can slow it down
But I ain't talkin about first
I know what your worth
and my head I've already bought you a purse and much more
And I got everything you need just like the drugstore
Oh, and before you ask
Keepin haters off of my nuts, yea that's what it comes for
A bunch more
Chances are comin your way, but I know that you'll take me
(It's crazy)
How people get lost in love, mixed up
I'm beginnin to daydream
Of what we could be and the things we could do if you give me your time
But tonight, all that's on my mind
Is gettin to know you in making you mine
You're a dime, girl
A straight ten
Like holy moly, me oh my
I don't even know where to begin
And let's pretend that in this moment of time we're more than friends
and I recommend that you and I get familiar

I ain't never met a girl, like you
And you'll never find a man, like me
Walking out the door, with you on my arm
You can hit me on my phone anytime you want

Got me goin mad, when you dress like that
Girl, it's a trap when you act like that
I ain't even mad when you dress like that
I know you know you bad when you act like that
Oh yeah
