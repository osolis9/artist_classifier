Oh, you already know what it is
We got anotha one, boy, ATL
(Just throw it in the bag)
Wassup Brooklyn? Wassup son?
Wassup Fabo?
Hey man, I got that black Amex wit me
Aka that throw it the bag card, yeah

Now I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Yeah, I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollarin' at my girl
I know you don't call yourself hollarin' at my girl

I keep her in Louboutin, Louie Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup, just like me
I'm the one with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

(Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag)
Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?
(Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag)
Neiman Marcus, you know what I mean, and all that, ya, come on

Look at price tags, where they do that at?
Heard that in ATL when I'm in ATL
Just ask my baby girl, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothin' so-so, and I know Jay Dee well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray CL
Got niggas lookin' like, "Did we miss a Mercedes sale?"
Don't wonda what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louie on my labels
That's the way we feel, must be nice, man
You wit' the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like
Son, I'm from Brooklyn, what it look like?
You get it 'cause I got it, I got it, so you get it
In Miami, they say don't stop, get it, get it
Mommy do the speedie, daddy do tha duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talkin' ruffles

Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag

See I know what I'ma tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it suppose to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar got him spendin' plenty bar
Broke ass nigga couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't gotta know so
Such a gentlemen, dozen bottles of that rose mo
Oh, you gotta man, well you need a richa one
Meet me in the parking lot, the place say get you one
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checkin', you can help them in a second
As we proceed to get you what you need
Like we breakin' down the weed, shorty, throw it in the bag
(Just throw it in the bag)

Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
Un-huh, un-huh, un-huh, just throw it in the bag
