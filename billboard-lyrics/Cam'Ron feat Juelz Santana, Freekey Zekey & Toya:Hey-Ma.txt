Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night

She looked at me and said you's a baby right

I told her, I'm 18 and live a crazy life plus I'll tell you what the 80's like And I know what the ladies like need a man
That's polite, listens and takes advice, I could be all three
Plus I can lay the pipe come wit me, come stay the night

She looked at me laughin', like boy your game is tight
I'm laughin' back like sho' ya right get in the car and don't touch nothin'
Sit in the car, let's discuss somethin'
