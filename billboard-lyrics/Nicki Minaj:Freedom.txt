Freedom:Nicki Minaj:23:2012-11-24

They never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died in the cross
Casue your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple

My career's been a pink prink
When I retire tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic instinct

Oh shit, my commercials on
Did I really buy these bitches with commercials songs?
Did I really pop and sign everything, I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew

So that was Young Wayne, Mac Maine, Baby and Slim Kane
Tex and Tia told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing I coulda went insane
And even now I think, do I really want this fame?

Let me hit up and go
700 to go, overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting a show
Man, I birthin' these artists and I'm starting to show

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Who I wanna work with? Nobody
99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like then killin shit, okay
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies

These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend the last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why theses niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon they be back up on our Ramen noodles
B-B-B-Bible

Queen is the title
And if you on my rifle that means you suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle

I'm your idol, I'm your idol

I'm your motherfucking idol
Pink Friday at Macey's

Thongs and some pasties
Where the other female rapper perfume in here?
Cause I musta missed it
12 million to kick my feet up
Get ready, this the Re-Up
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What hiding from
What you hiding from
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What hiding from
You hiding from, hiding baby
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
All for your all?
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
All for your all?
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here
