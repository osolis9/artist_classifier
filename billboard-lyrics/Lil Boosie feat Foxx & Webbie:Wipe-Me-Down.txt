(Cause Im on, wipe me down)

I pull up at the club V-I-P
Gas tank on E but all drinks on me
(Wipe me down)
Fresh kicks, fresh white tall tee
Fresh NFL hat, fresh 'bauds with the crease
(Wipe me down)

Pussy niggas wanna hit me wit they heat
Real recognize real real niggaz gon speak
(Wipe me down)
Jiggalatin I been rollin bout a week
You can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth
(Wipe me down)

Black shades so you know a nigga rollin
Ain't check me at the door, so ain't no tellin what Im holdin
(Wipe me down)
Bad bitches, they gon bust it wide open
Niggas flashin they lil' bread but Im the nigga they approachin
(Wipe me down)

Small niggas, tall figures, yall niggas crowd niggas

Red bones, caramel, all of em stop and stare
All of em tryna steal my underwear
(Wipe me down)

I like to floss like Rick Ross, got a hit called 'Set It Off"
When I sing it everybody set it off
(Wipe me down)
Black mink, damn Im on play wit me

(Wipe me down)

Fresh fade, fresh J's, on the corner playin spades
Im an ordinary person but Im paid
(Wipe me down)
Foxx flippin, Webbie smokin and we chokin
On a whole pound of purple famous like The Ninja Turtles
(Wipe me down)

Just left New York City, hooked up wit P. Diddy
Finna blow past 50 you gon have to

Hoes drop it like its hot, yeah nigga Im the shit
(Wipe me down)
You see this ice on my wrist how it glisten soon as the light hit
You can't lie, the ice sick
(Wipe me down)

Purple got me smellin funky red monkey
500 dollars on em you ain't seen these yet
(Wipe me down)
Beatin you can hear me way around the corner
Paint wet wit them 24's on em that's a bet
(Wipe me down)

Ol ladies, baby mommas, few fiancs
Niggas' wifes, savage life who I'm gonna fuck next
(Wipe me down)
And I use the Lifestyle or the Magnum or the Trojan
Or go head and use the barrel of the tech
(Wipe me down)

Man this chain hit me for a couple grand
Oh no, I ain't complainin just watch how you wipe my chest
(Wipe me down)
A bad bitch wanted me to stay there longer
I put that dick up on her but I had a flight to catch
(Wipe me down)

Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes

Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
Shoulders, chest, pants, shoes
