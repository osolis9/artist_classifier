International-Love:Pitbull Featuring Chris Brown:15:2012-04-21

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, Miss International love
Ohh, Miss International love

(I don't play football but i touch down everywhere
everywhere?, everywhere
I don"t play baseball but i hit a home run everywhere
everywhere?, everywhere)

I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side and told me Pit you can have me and my sister
In Lebanon yeah the women are bomb
And in Greece you've guessed it the women are sweet
Spinned all around the world but I ain't gon' lie there's nothing like Miami's heat

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, Miss International love
Ohh, Miss International love

(Down in DR they're looking for visas
I ain't talking credit cards, if you know what i mean
En Cuba la cosa esta dura
But the women get down, if you know what i mean)
.got everything on
Some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
(En Colombia the women got everything good
some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' boobs
And their thongs, blue, yellow, and green,)

En L.A. tengo la Mexicana, en New York tengo la.
He sido para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah!
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera!

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, Miss International love!
Ohh, Miss International love!

There's not a place that your love don't affect me baby
So don't ever change
I crossed the globe when I'm with you baby
Ayy
Woah-oh

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, Miss International love!
Ohh, Miss International love!
