Checkin' in the closet for my blue Velour suit
Piping all around it wit the matchin' Timb boots
Hop up in the wagon wit the 20 inch shoes on, ohh

Ridin' down the street wit a twenty G stack
Shorty paging me sayin', "Zino where you at?"
Look up in the mirror 5-0 up on my back it's, uh ohh

Pull up in the spot smokin' in the parkin' lot
Everybody havin' fun, don't stop
Pray to God that I don't have to let the pop it's

Maybe all the ladies wanna chill wit Benz and Hef
Pushin' up the bottle 'til there's no more Henny left
Step it up to Louie now let's see what happens next yo

We gon' throw the party, rock the party
Then drink Bacardi, freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all, ohh

We gon' throw the party, rock the party
Then drink Bacardi, freak somebody

Lookin' at the shorty wit the Frankie B Jeans
Thong hangin' out, butterfly belly ring
Butter leather boots with the tassels that's mean, ohh

Got up on that ass when she came up in the door
Rock it to the beat then we took it to the floor
DJ in the club spinnin' record back and forth, ohh

People going hard 'cause you know the mood is right
Everybody screaming like they at a Tyson fight
Young Hef in the back wit a dime lookin' tight, oh-my, ohh

Hit the sour diesel mami bouncin' on my lap
VIP crowded so I take it to the back
Up in the coat room where you find Zino at
And Mario too yo

Now everybody just throw the party, rock the party
Then drink Bacardi, freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all, ohh

We gon' throw the party, rock the party
Then drink Bacardi, freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all, ohh

5 in the morning more drinks at the crib
Whatchu waitin' for? Mami get your in
Hop up in the coupe, girls riding wit my friend
"Y-y-yo, y'all follow us, follow us"

Rollin' through the city wit the CD on blast
Pull up at the mansion had to dip up in the stash, yeah
Scene lookin' sexy shorty got a fat, oh-my-God

Step up in the place everybody gettin' wet
Sweatin' on the floor dancin' like they havin' sex
Poppin' Champagne takin' bottles to the neck
Uh uh uh, yeah, c'mon

Lookin' at my Jacob it's about that time
Suns comin' up 'bout to close the blinds, yeah
This is how we do almost everyday
Now meet me upstairs wit Courvoisier, yo

We gon' throw the party, rock the party
Then drink Bacardi, freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all, ohh

We gon' throw the party, rock the party
