Purple-Hills:D12:1:2002-01-12

I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palms
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick
And lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb stuff start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed, I meant coke dumb ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb and gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is crashing now
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out

Fuck that, someone help Denaun
Who's upstairs wrestling with Elton John
Hey Von, you see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It gotta be Tums the Ex-lax is gone
?With some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
Yo, it's probably numb
Dumb dumb before they come
And I think he's 'bout to swallow his tongue
Your scary brother with a false alarm
Think they're about to die when I just got on
Stop acting dumb
You so drunk
That you might wake up with a pump in your stomach
I think I did too much
I think I got the rush
Rolaids, Pepto, and Tums
Watch out HERE WE COME

I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

Dirty Dozen
80 Of us
Shady brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some-, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something

Ayo, pop pills
Pills I pop
Pop them pills
Or still show off
Walk on stilts?
Thought it was incredible I made it home
I wanna roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
I'm a go for broke
I hope you don't
Pack up my nose with coke
*Cough cough cough*
It must have broke the choke
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta straight born infant
(You're crazy!)

I down four shots at one time
I don't need chasers when I'm swallowing mine
You got any room
Bizarre heads back
We can't go far
'Cause the car has flats
Why the heck you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me
How to breach contracts
If you got cash
Then I'm with you
(Swift, chill)
I just wanna get by like you
?
?, The hell with you too
I just need these three cuts then I'm cool
I just got some and I'm going back soon

I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

I'm at rave
Looking like a babe
Like she want it
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Looney, crazy, dopey headed, sexy head guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses
Wanna try
Blue hills, golden seals
Got Bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill
Chick I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night

I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
