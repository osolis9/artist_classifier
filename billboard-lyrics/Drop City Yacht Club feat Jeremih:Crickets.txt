Crickets:Drop City Yacht Club feat Jeremih:25:2013-06-01

So, I told her like oh darliAnnotaten
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it

I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a f*ck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

I’m like “Girl whatcha doin for today?”
Im thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don’t believe in love at first sight
But after seein’ you baby maybe I might
Cause when you walked by. I knew you we’re my type
The apple of my eye. You’re flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) I’m just warmin’ up

Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin’ caught up
Goin’ down, goin’ down, yeah I’m shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up
And If you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but you’re so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didn’t gimme a glance. Damn

So, I told her like oooh baby
I’m so amazed by everything that you do
So, I told her like oh darlin
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it

I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a f*ck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up. (what’s up)
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

Yeah, yeah, I said “Girl whatcha doin’ on the weekend”
And she said “I don’t even know depends”
But you’re the one that I’ve been seein’ in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening
I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I’ll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I’ll be in the deep end

Ha. Your beauty got me sinkin’
Got me sayin’ “all this shit” without thinkin’
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that I’m always repeatin’

But it’s the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if you’re a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn, she was apparently

So, I told her like oh baby
I’m so amazed by everything that you do
So, I told her like oh darlin
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it

I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a f*ck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

In this light, you’re lookin’ like you’re inflight
Pretty voice, put a ribbon on you’re wind pipe
Silly girl, you’ve been playin’ with me all night
But we can work it out, I been on my gym hype

Yeah, I heard you had a boyfriend and stuff and
I was just calling to tell you that its cool cause
My other girlfriend got one too haha
So I told her like

So, I told her like oh baby
I’m so amazed by everything that you do.
So, I told her like oh darlin
I feel like I am fallin’

I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a f*ck
Oh, oh.
Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
