tell 'em you don't give a fuck, baby spin that ass 'round
tell the dj turn it up, what the fuck in that sound
a boogie wit da hoodie and it's always foreign
yea i know she like my style, them other niggas borin'
when i pull up it go skrrt skrrt, that's a foreign
when i pull up at a red light they don't want it

introduced her to my plug, now she think she all that
when i first hit her up, no she never wrote back
so i sa her at the club and i got up on that

"this my shit"

now every time they play this song she say
"this my shit"
see the flick of my wrist
and i she know wassup

see the flick of my wrist
