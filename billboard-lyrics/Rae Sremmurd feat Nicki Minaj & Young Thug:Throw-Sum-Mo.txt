Throw-Sum-Mo:Rae Sremmurd feat Nicki Minaj & Young Thug:6:2015-06-20

Ass fat
Yeah I know, you just got cash
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo', blow sum mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor

Its rainin' hundreds
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

Slim Jimmy
Hay, bye hater
I flood the club with paper
Shorty got an ass, some for now and some for later
Somethin' like Nicki's, dancin' like Maliah
I'm throwin' all this money I'ma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night till my wrist tired
If you put in work, this the night you gonna retire

You a bad bitch, I ain't even gonna deny her
She told me "throw that money", I said "make it worth my while"
I'm bout to empty out the ATM (Throw it, throw it, throw it)
She doin' tricks that make a nigga wanna spend (blow it, blow it)
Girl you know you got me fascinated
Just keep on dancin' till I'm outta paper
(Never)

Ass fat
Yeah I know, you just got cash
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo', blow sum mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor

Its rainin' hundreds
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

Franklins, rainin' on your body
Rainin' on your body, rainin' on your body
Won't you do what I say?
Start rubbin' on your body
You like hunnid's on your body
Girl you needs to get naughty
Hold up, hold on
Her eyes on me, is that your hoe
If so I'ma get her 'fore the nights over
DJ play my shit so I'm finna crank up off in the V.I.P zone
See the money go up, and she dance on sight
By the end of the night she on endo'
Lemme see you make it clap on tempo
Lemme see you get low like limbo

Ass fat
Yeah I know, you just got cash
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo', blow sum mo'

The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor
Its rainin' hundreds
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

Come here hoe, mistletoe
I got birdies, crows
Flip it a bit, wanna jump on the dick
I'm like bool lets get it, lets get it
I got these bitches kissin' on these bitches
I can't even count em' I fuck by the digits
Swag, terrific, I might fuck that bitch in the kitchen
Baby don't use dirty dishes
Or else you might whip up a BURRRR!
My neck, my wrists are BURRRR!
She wanna fuck like dogs I'm like "woof"
Panoramic roof, I drop the coupe, boo
Pulled up with a bitch she look like New New
Its ok if I lie to you bitch, I swear the truth
Hey, she come right back like them divers do
Fifty thousand off fifty niggas, no caliber
Ass fat
Yeah I know, you just got cash
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo', blow sum mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor
Its rainin' hundreds
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
