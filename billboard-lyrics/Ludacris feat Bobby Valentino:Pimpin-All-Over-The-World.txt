Pimpin-All-Over-The-World:Ludacris feat Bobby Valentino:2:2005-10-29

Oh yeah

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world

Sing it, sing it
All over the world, the world

All over the world baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
'Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine
But I'ma start at home, when I see a girl I like

I walk straight up to her  and I'm like 'Ugh, hey girl how ya doin''
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name
And you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, hey

See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin' of me
We got people to meet and many places to see, hey

I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin'
A crash wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausin' so fast, hey

I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes, oh yeah

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world

You hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
'Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV

Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the autobahn
Swervin' drivin', next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands

If you wit me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach
But I drop you off and pay you no attention
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention

Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecomin' at Howard
Hawaii to D.C., it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, hey, oh yeah

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world

I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardigras all the women tryna show me their chest, hey

I'm in Jamaica spendin' massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rap wit no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan, hey

I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoe
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago ugh, oh

Yet and still you wouldn't believe your eyes
If you went to Brazil, ain't no need of even askin'
(What a breast they have!)
Brah, the best women are reside in Africa, and that's real , oh yeah

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world

Sing it, sing it
All over the world
