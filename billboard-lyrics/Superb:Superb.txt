"Tony Starks fights again for survival
And by just a thin thread of electric current
Wins another victory."

Ugh, c'mon, yeah, c'mon y'all
(Bounce wit us) Hip-hop
(What? Celebrities, what?)
(Street corner) For all my niggas
Crack spot niggas
Chip Banks starts to sing "we made it"
Chicken ass mothafuckas, envious bitches
Yo, you know what y'all...

Make me wan' pop sumthin', no champagne
Two-five on me, weed and crack on me
Bitch motherfucker tried to get a rep' off me
Leave him there, never know, get him off me
I remember days when we just fucked bitches
Bought a lot of clothes and, played the ave
Now we rap niggas with a lot of wardrobes
And if we want a nigga dead we pay the cash
I ain't tryin to waste my career on y'all
Even scuffle with y'all, waste gear on y'all
But if I gotta go out, you know I'mma show out
You gon' fuck around and get your whole back blown out
I remember on the Island, Cay tone out
In the Mess Hall hall, about to zone out
Dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out
We just dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out

See. see. see me
I roll with Ghost and cats that carry they toast
Make the Post, front page and, center-Stagin'
When it's time to bust off them things, it ain't a thing man
We rocked out own diamond rings, see them 'Bling, Bling'
Got big boy toys, push Sixes
Dime bitches, told y'all before we import those
Jury stay froze, court cases get closed
Niggas hate Nino cuz how fast I rose up
Like George Jefferson and em, steppin on em
The headline read, "Starks had the weapon on em"
And the vest, what y'all expect? He a vet
Plus the best, now tell me how we gon' fail
When we dealin with 'Supreme Clientele'

From Rikers Island to the Cayman Island
We thugs like, life is the same challenge
Do the knowledge, recognize your talent
And if you live the streets, you better stay silent

Yo, spotted at The Mirage, Ghostface swarmed by groupies
Mingle amongst stars, I come in cat, invades Mars
Highlight of the century, first bet placed upon entry
Fainted when the book mentioned me
Keep ballin, new systems, high sciences
Drop that, Ghost listenin, track sizzlin
Angelica, Judy Plum for bitches, Goines king of the century
Best sellers for niggas, stay together
Posted up trucks, leanin on the Benz
Cinemax smile shot in thrity-five lens
You program, broke bottles of Dom
Seven inch bangles, back breakers
I'm a dope fiend, look at my arm, Popeye strength
Rap with a British accent, Gucci clothes
Dennis Coles in the latest fashions
Blow backs in, flip raps like fourty-eight bundles
Dinner plates, deadly front gates, celeb Bryant Gumbel

Analyze This shit like Deniro, words in your center earhole
Blocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero
Shatter your soul like glass windows
Turn virgins to nymphos, pop these hollows at fake cats in a Tahoe
Wild out, throw your liquor bottles at hood rats to the richest models
We conversate like Christ and the twelve apostles
And life without you, held counsel with great men
To murderers in the state pen, bein' caged in
The wages of sin, before they read up they pop our tape in
You ain't gotta tuck you chain in cuz here we want the head of Satan
Durags and our pants hangin

Chip Banks starts to sing "we made it" again

Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's right y'all
Street corners
Jail niggas
Riker's Island
Ge-Grey Haven
Big Un
That's right y'all
Word up
All y'all, all y'all crumbs
We made it, nigga
Step the fuck off
True indeed, true indeed
Yeah, Ready Red
That's right, my nigga Born
That's right yo
Lil' Free in the feds
That's right, you'll be home nigga
Yeah, we made it
Yeah, C Allah, word up
That's fam
Yeah, check it out
Staten Island
True indeed
Five boroughs
Check it, uh-huh
