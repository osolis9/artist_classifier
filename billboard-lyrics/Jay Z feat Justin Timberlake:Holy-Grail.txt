Holy-Grail:Jay Z feat Justin Timberlake:1:2014-01-18

1: Justin Timberlake]
You take the clothes off my back
And I let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Oh
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
Yeah

And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from your cup

Till it runneth over, Holy Grail

Bleu told me to remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' about
I'm the nigga, caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
God damn it it I like it
bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma please just get my bail

I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself

And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Now we all just entertainers

Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with
It, this shit ain't work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water
You're still alive
Still that nigga
Niggas you survived
You still getting bigger nigga
Living the life

Vanilla wafers
In a villa
Illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson's, Thriller

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart just so you can watch me bleeding
I still don't know why
Why I love you so much

Yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much, yeah.

Don't know why...
