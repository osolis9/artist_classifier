That-Way:Wale feat Jeremih & Rick Ross:5:2012-01-21

i apologize, i don't recollect your name
oh baby i don't know your name
and let me tell you that them heels
really complement your frame (look at your body baby)
girl let me get them oooh, ahhs, then i gotta catch my plane
say you miss me and you wishing for some private time,
girl, how could we get that way girl, how could we get that way

1 (Wale)
look another day another dollar
she hate me when i leave cause when i leave i never call her.
is life shit my shit i could call you right quick,
but if i call you gone be like boo why we haven't skype yet
and i skype bet you say said le where my flight at,
if i decline then you inquire where i have spent my night's at
shit this life is overwhelming and more than hectic,
but a woman worth some anger, is certainly worth some effort.
just look closer, my life is quite deceptive,
women will sell their soul just to buy some attention.
i need somethingto hold fuck that passive agression
and when I'm back from off the road,
don't ask me no questions please

fear what you don't know!
aha!

Don't remember how i met her,
but i know i won't forget her,
and if lovin her is wrong, then i know i won't see heaven.
she say she's from seattle, she's twenty and some change
and before i to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain
then i back up on my plane chi-town o'hare
we spend some time, get some wine, have some miles from Harold's.
i told her this is overrated, but i love your city baby
gotta get back to the D you know we're finally famous
driver drop me off in Dallas I'm heading to some money,
TSA be laughin all the rubbers in your luggage, i know imma always leave 'em but i swear i'll always love 'em
Tell her you'll probably find someone, but you'll never find another

Wale oww!

got all my seude shoes, I'm in a great mood
at baggage claim awaiting miss thang out of st louis
know she's shining bright, got on my cartier
she's my billie jean, we menage mary jane.
see we city hop vegas to l.a
brings a lot of joy bugatti boy that's laina lane
our faucets has used to drip, i used to ride the bench
but it was written cursive for this king to exist.
pack her bags now she lives amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup Gi-Givenchy consumer Gianni Versace connoisseur a carnivore
Accountable for half a million uncounted for
