I-Know-What-You-Want:Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey feat The Flipmode Squad:3:2003-08-02

Yeah
Shorty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out either
I'ma give it all to you, baby
It's on, bust it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear

I'm always on the road
Hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that
Can't talk on the phone

I know you aggravated
Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How longer can you tolerate it

Listen ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind
Tryin' to elevate it now

Hey yo, to really be honest
You stuck with me
Through my whole struggle
Can't even express the words
How much the kid loves ya

I'ma stand as a man
Never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you

And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex
We tease in a passionate way

I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the guard feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you, ma

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want

Shh, mami listen
I feel ya love for me, baby
And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you

Listen, I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the
Unnecessary rigga-ma-ro

I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed

Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets
Like we would never get old

Went from Lucy's and buses
To fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas
To Lexus to Rovers

Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw
None of these industry cats

We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game
Watchin' our seeds gettin' older

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Yes, you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby, come and get more close to me
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be

I pull up to the house
In a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA
You haven't seen me

Ya lookin' good
In that Gucci bikini
38 carats
Ya ring lookin' freezy

No matter what I do in the world
You never leave me
Fall back, ma
I'll make ya lifestyle easy

I appreciate the things
Ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter
You'll never do me greasy

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
