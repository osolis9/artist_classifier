So-Fly:Slim feat Yung Joc:18:2008-07-19

I'm so fly, so fly
So high, so high
So fly, so fly

Just stepped out fresh out the shower
Gotta stay fresh take about an hour
Gotta get dressed your boy’s so clean
Both of em' off, I got them blue jeans

Fresh pair of shades, house on my wrists
Socks to the drawers your boy stay fit
I’m ready, can't nobody tell me nothing

I'm so fly, so fly
Feels like I’m taking off
I'm so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off

So fly, so fly
Feels like I'm taking off
I'm so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly

Got my keys, picked my toy
Top drop down, let the haters hear the noise
Hit that paddle turn that wheel
Push that run make it all disappear

Phone is ringing its the Bluetooth
Call me on the phone like ay what it do
I’m coming and we gonna take this over

I'm so fly, so fly
Feels like I’m taking off
I'm so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off

So fly, I’m so fly
Feels like I'm taking off
I'm so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off
I'm so fly

Made it to the club everybody know what's up
Superstar status through the door VIP
All the ladies come with me
Want a drink? Come on in
Everybody it’s on me
Showing love everybody showing me love

Ay Jock, wattup?
What she ask you pimp?

She ask me how's the air up there
You can catch me in the treetop
This right here is a classic like a pair of Reeboks
Switching four lanes in the old school t top
Doing the h chop chop chopping up the street tops

Set the club on fire but anything that we drop
You hit the juice box wet make that pussy beat box
She on a handstand and I love the way she p pop

She can tell ima g, she can tell ima g
She can tell ima g, she can tell ima g
And the g man and g cold
I touch the g spot and do the g fold

A hundred dollar bill, that’s a c note
You got a ten of em, and that’s a g note
I check the time ice blocks on my g shock
You know who it is, Slim and Young Jeezock

I’m so fly, so fly
It feels like I’m taking off
I’m so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off

So fly, I’m so fly
(Slim and Young Jock, so you know it’s going down)
I'm so high, so high
(Slim and Young Jock, so you know it’s going down)

So fly
It feels like I’m taking off
I’m so high, so high
Looking for a shorty to break me off
