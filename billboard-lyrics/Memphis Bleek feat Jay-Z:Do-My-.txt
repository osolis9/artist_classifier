(feat. Jay-Z)
[Jay-Z]
Turn that motherfucker louder
It's the Roc in this motherfucker
Bi-otch!
Oh yeah, bounce, uh uhbounce
Yeah, yeah bounce, come on
Oh come on bounce, come on
Do my ladies run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
Or do my thugs run this motherfucker?
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
[Memphis Bleek]
Do my ladies run it
Fat asses and flat stomachs
Throw a hand in the air
If it's the year of the woman
Or my dogs run it
Let 'em know that you're still gunnin'
Throw a drink in the air
Let 'em know you still thuggin'
Yo I come through, few of my man's
Scoop you and your friends
You, you, and you with the Timbs
In tight jeans, Chinese eyes
Indian hair, Black girl ass
Let me pour you a glass of Belvi
Tell me all about your past
Let me console your soul
While I palm your ass
And your man did what?
He ain't give you?
He cheated with her
I can't diss duke
I tell you this though
Get with this dude
I'll teach you about dough
And show you what this do
(It's a secret society, all we ask is trust)
But I don't freeze bitches
Just skeeze bitches
Break up happy homes
Just seize misses
You'll never get her back once you get a yacht
How you love that?
How you love that?
