Teen drinking is very bad
Yo I got a fake ID though
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo
2 step with me, 2 step with me

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dancefloor
Babygirl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour

Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I bought out the stores
Bottom of the 9th in the nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move onto the next whore

Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop man we do shit for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run

Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hunz
While she goin' down I'm breakin' down what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

Everybody in this bitch gettin' tips

2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy

Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Maybe 21 girl dats alright
I wonder if a shake comin' wit dem fries
If so baby can I get 'em super sized

Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She start feelin' on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
What instead of one lifestyle I need 2

Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
And she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Nigga waste it on me man son of a bitch

Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Gris orange juice man this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique

Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you're as drunk as me
Club on the set kwon cut out them trees
Dude I don't care I'm a P I M P
