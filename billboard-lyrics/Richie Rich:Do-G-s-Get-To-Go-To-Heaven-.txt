Do-G-s-Get-To-Go-To-Heaven-:Richie Rich:10:1997-05-03

Dedicate this to my man Tupac
Rest in peace, boy, you know it's all luv
Do we get to go? Do we go?
I want to know right now, I need to know

Who holds jurisdiction over my twisted thoughts?
And I'm not to blame for what happens off in this game
I'm do or die about my scratch but I know
This dope game for me just ain't tha way to go

But still I'm there grin and Waten
For that next paper thinkin' about how to loaded another caper
It's some cold shit to know, I can slang all night and slang all day
But never have tha courage to pray

Believe I know better but somehow I feel that I'm lost at the crossroads
But I'm afraid to cross, could it be what I'm drinkin' ? It got me thinkin'
Like I'm thinkin', "Lord I need help but I can't help my self"
I awake to to sirens, homies dien, kids in tha street with no food to eat
Hoes gettin' money in they only profession
But Lord I only got one question?

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

And if I took a life are perhaps sold some dope
Would you discriminate upon my entry to tha gate?
I need to know my fate, 'coz now my life ain't straight
But look at this place where I live its so so crooked

I didn't shot that man but I watched him die
And saw tha pain and struggle in his eye and didn't cry
So when I hear tha thunder are you takin' me under?
Are is my seein' as bad as tha gooder

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

For every time I walked by and every time I got high
For every man that I watched die, Lord, I need to know
Do Gs get to go for all tha women I run through?
Those I did and didn't plan to ?
For every scam I ran my hands through?
Lord, I need to do gs get to go?

And if they get to go, when it's time to meet my maker
Will, he understand that I'm only a man flesh n bone
Born to die in tha zone, and gets loney trying to make it on
Ya own

And when my baby cries my intentions are to feed
And fulfill tha needs of my one and only seed
And if I rob and steal let it read in my will
"Payback tha ones who fell victims to my guns on tha run"

But knowin' that I can't hide, why do I feel tha way I feel in side?
It's like my soul is leavin' me, are you decievin' me?
I hear voices, sayin' believe in me, is it you I hear?
There's a man named God that can fix it, when it's twisted
Not sayin' I'm all that bad but I can use a lil help
'Coz at times I can't help my self

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

Do G's get to go to?
Do G's get to go to?
Do G's get to go to?
Do G's get to go to?

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
Do G's get to go to?
Do G's get to go to?
Do G's get to go to?

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

I know what's wrong, I know what's right
Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight
If I feel down, I might find
Will I got to Heaven if I die tonight?

Only you know whether it's day or night
Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight?
Heaven, oh, Heaven
Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight?
Heaven, oh, Heaven
Will I go to Heaven if I die tonight?
