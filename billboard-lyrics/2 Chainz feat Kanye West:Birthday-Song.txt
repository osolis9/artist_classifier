Birthday-Song:2 Chainz feat Kanye West:7:2013-01-26

Yeah
Birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that Louis store

They ask me what I do and who I do it for Yeah
Birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside the Louis store
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe

All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe
When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe
She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr Scrr, Wrists moving, cookin' to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a jugg I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle (err), hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer, goin' on a trapathon
See I done have more bombs than Pakistan

Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm ballin' you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, true everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to 2 bitches

Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you doing huh?

It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh?
She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh?
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T.V on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a Minaj
'Specially if you put that BMW in the garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Weren't you at niece's graduation? Man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"
How 'bout she hit the West End and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit
We in Kanye West's benz, 'cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian
Yeah

It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)

Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on

(What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl
I might switch it up and get you girl
Deuce and Ye
We like Snoop and Dre
And it's your birthday, baby
You deserve a coupe today

(You in first place, you in first place)
(Bad bitch contest you in first place

And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big bag ae gear
All I want for my birthday is a big bag ae gear
When I die, bury me inside that Gucci store
