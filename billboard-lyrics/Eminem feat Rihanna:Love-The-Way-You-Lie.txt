Love-The-Way-You-Lie:Eminem feat Rihanna:1:2010-12-25

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it
"Wait! Where you going?"
"I'm leaving you!"
"No you ain't! Come back"
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed

I snapped "Who's that dude?"
"I don't even know his name"

I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know, my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin', fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each others' hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways

Guess that they don't know ya, 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again

Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship, isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
(Just gonna)

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
