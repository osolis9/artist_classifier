Come-To-Me:Diddy Featuring Nicole Scherzinger:3:2007-01-20

You're all out there waiting
To break my heart again
Break my heart different
You're on one team
Yet still contemplating
Break my heart, oh different
Let's have a drink
Let's have a drink
Do you see right there
Here's to you and me, oh oh
Let's take a shot
Since you've been taking shots
And allow me to serve you this break up
On the rocks
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break up
On the rocks
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
Now you're out there without me
Breaking hearts again, oh dear friend
But I try to tell you
That love will show you
That you would break your own heart in the end
If you thought I'll ever go round
Won't catch up with you
Let that don't hit your ass up
Photoshop you out this picture
See I wasn't around for this
So you might wanna sit down for this
It hurt so bad that I should cry
Awkward silence you know why
Let's have a drink
Let's have a drink
Do you see right there
Here's to you and me, oh oh
Let's take a shot
Since you've been taking shots
And allow me to serve you this break up
On the rocks
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break up
On the rocks
If you thought I'll ever go round
Won't catch up with you
Let that don't hit your ass up
Photoshop you out this picture
Let's have a drink
Let's have a drink
Do you see right there
Here's to you and me, oh oh
Let's take a shot
Since you've been taking shots
And allow me to serve you this break up
On the rocks
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break up
On the rocks
You never miss a good thing until it's gone
And allow me to serve you this break up
On the rocks
