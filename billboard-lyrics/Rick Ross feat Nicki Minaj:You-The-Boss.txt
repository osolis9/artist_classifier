Still runnin the streets cause everyday I'm hustlin
Double mg winnin in the streets is lovin it
All this paper comin

And my baby touchin it
I pinned her to the wall
You know this boy be bustin it
Fur coast in the winter
Look like a polar bear
Stuntin in the snow
These haters, they can go somewhere
Indoor pool
Outdoor pool
Indoor pool
Talkin ray j moves

Pink slips like a boss

Champagne on her body
Time to lick it off
Me and baby girl are winning combination
Ownership is my conversation
I'm a boss
