I-Get-Crazy:Nicki Minaj feat Lil Wayne:20:2010-01-23

I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy
I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy

You know
it's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real real far away
young money
that's. that's. that's just what we do
You know, I mean we we wear straight jackets
and we we. we. we stay in you know padded rooms
and you know.and fly away

I just came out of the motherfuckin old school
Got my mac notebook with the pro tools
Ya'll bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad WOOF WOOF flyer than a frisby
So I'm up in Mandalay eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star they say wen I star spangle
B-B-B-B Banner
I I I I am the the the rap hannah
Ma mon montana so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes but don't call me Santa
And I am flyer den reindeers in da winter

I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy
I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy

So I got a bad bitch mentality cause I just came frorm another galaxy
I be with the president up in the white house
If we in the oval office then his lights out.
Cause I am the wicked witch I'm the nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my jickster
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I am nicki L-M-N-O-winsky
I mean my name ring bells like tinky
I mean tinker
Tell that nigga link her
Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy
I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy

1 2 3rd floor
Hospital bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straight jacket crooked I hear you lookin
I promise I'm Hard and I swear you Pussy
I aint crazy no yes I am
Riqht Up in the coo coo nest I land
I'm fly now eat my bull shit
Yea I'm crazy crazy bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm looking for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, da superb witch
And Weezy F. Baby, no Weezy F. (Crazy)
I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy
I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy I I gets crazy
