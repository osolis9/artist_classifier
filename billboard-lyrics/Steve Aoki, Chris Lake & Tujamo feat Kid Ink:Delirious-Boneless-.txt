Delirious-Boneless-:Steve Aoki, Chris Lake & Tujamo feat Kid Ink:21:2014-09-27

Hold up, you got me woke up,
The way you roll that
Sticky like okra
Just let me coach ya
Show you 'bout my culture
It's the late night show like Conan
The party it arn't over (Go)
Go ham in here, and grab your friend by the hand
Let me know is you down?
Body like playmate of the year
I might make the play of the year
Already know that we don't play fair
But I think that you and your girl
Should bring me some of that

We stay
Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We've gone delirious!
Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We gone delirious!
La la la la la la

We've gone delirious!
La la la la la la

Come and take a ride
Stay up all night, ohhkaay

We on sunset, until the sun up
I got my goons here
So don't you run up
It could get ugly
Think I need a wing man
I'm straight from California
Smelling like the weed man
La la la la la la
I got a lot of so go and take a hit
Dip, drip, one send for the fifth
I ain't seen nothing girl
I plead the fifth
Make your man cease to exist
All this money don't make no sense, you scared!
Gimme some of that!

Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We've gone delirious!
Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
