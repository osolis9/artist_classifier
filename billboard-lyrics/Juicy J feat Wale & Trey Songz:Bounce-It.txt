Bounce-It:Juicy J feat Wale & Trey Songz:18:2013-12-21

Yeah
Yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane
Yeah
I'm 'bout to take yo' girl (bounce it)
Check it
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
Yes sir!, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbing ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick
I was thinking different, different

Clap that ass, light our blunt
Baby, let's get ig'nant, ig'nant
She's strips for the Gs, rake cash like leaves
She got double Ds, and ain't shit free
Came with my goons but I'm leaving with a diva
With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain't finished college, she a head doctor

Bouncing ass while I'm getting high as propellers on a helicopter
Let's do it again (again)
Me, you and your friend (friend)
We don't even need a room, give me head up in my Benz (in my Benz)
Where my double cup (cup)
Time to pour it up (up)
Got a bitch so bad you can't afford to fuck, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it

Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Hands is on her you know what

Cause bandz a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast
My pants be on that too much lust
And I'm 'bout whatever baby
Take a photo, I'm looking good
And these breezies are so beneath you
Understand you're misunderstood
Premium leather goods
We pay whatever for it
Over these pussy niggas
Only under influence
Throw a block up then I back out, like that
Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I'ma smack
And a bucket but we nothing but tatted
Bald-headed scallywags, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Marc Gasol, or Selby do, that's plenty dough
That's Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those, ralph!
Bounce it, bounce it

Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy
Toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl
Do a Montana line off of her titty
Ain't trying to fuck, I just found a replacement
Feeling so global, I think I need Asian
Ratchet on deck and they know I'm gon' stunt
I'm trying to get head while smoking a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I don't know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a Styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they popping
Do it real good, might take you shopping
All these racks can't fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stocking
Then it's back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don't buy these broads Nike
But I keep these girls in check
Working for that money, bitch
You gon' have to break a sweat, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
