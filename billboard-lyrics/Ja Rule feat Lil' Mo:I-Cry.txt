when i cry, you cry
we cry, together
said i cry, you cry
we cry, together
said i cry, you cry
we cry, together
said i cry, you cry
we cry, together
i life i love my wife
a bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me
i'm livin in hell but livin wealthy
and know these hoes love me
because i'm a star
i can't even cop a drink at the bar
get me some bottles of that remi mar-tin
let's get the party
cracking right here fuck v.i.p
now when my baby loves me
home wit tears in her eyes
and when i get in, i hurt her more by tellin her lies
she ain't surprise at me
just surprise at we
been together for this long
and i can be
the one to mistreat her
thought it last forever
cuz if i cry, you cry
we cry together
from, what i recall we was little niggas
cut, who gettin high, the hottest pictures
livin, life so free
that we ain't fearin
the, ills of the world
in heat of drug dealin
you and i then made a killin
and tuck together
i this land of forbidden treasure
love is the only evil seed that could sever
a tied this close
not the love between us but your love for the dough
you went o.t started makin m-o-n-e-why
all my good niggas gotta die
but shit could last forever
i wish (???) was pleasure
cuz when you die
i cried, we cried together
wash away your tears (my love)
you ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
i'm putting on everything out (my love)
and my pain it's my love
and i want
this world to smile for me
don't shed a tear cuz the nigga died happily
my momma warned me life was a muthafucka
but i ignored the warning and kept on hustlin
and every night she just looked at me
tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like
"i don't want me baby to die"
brought so much pain into a life
gotta make it better
cuz when ma cried i cried
we cried together
oooooohhhh
you cry, then i cry
then we cry
when he cries
i cry together, together
when i cry, then you cry
then we'll cry, together
baby, cuz when
ja cries, mo cries
we'll cry, together
if he cry, i'll cry
then we'll cry, together
