An I don't care, G-Units goin straight to the top this year
Nigga Im So Fly'
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy'.
Banks is fresh out the gutta (gutta)

To smooth to stutta (stutta)

His cig will melt a riva like 2 scoups of butta (butta)
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burna cuz she aint concerned cuz he's a earna
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to burn her
We Fight, wake up n' fuck like Ike n' Tina Turner
It's a privilege to ride with a celeb
Cause them girls over there don't got a problem given head
Paranoia is on ya that's why your mama is in your bed
Fuck a rare chinchilla and bossin mama for ya head
where the block im from niggas be damn near 40 and still tuckin
niggas baby mama is pregnant and still fuckin
It's eithier cause their boyfriend is a scrub like brillow
Or cuz banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
The chronic is blown
For my niggas that got locked up and deported and now they gotta go back home
I'm So Fly'
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy

I'm So High'
An I'm on point and I can tell that you jealous by the look in your eye
When I Ride By'

Don't confuse me with these suckas
Cause when I spit you hear more ouus then a skip to my lou move at the rucka
Thank god for given Banks the gift

You think that bandana makes you a gangsta but all I see is a handkerchief

Nigga there's no one out the click that freeze us
Believe that cause I aint scared of shit but jesus
Look dawg i dont roam with the poodles
Difference is i'm eating in Rome and you eatin roman noodles
Ya boys corrupt kid
Banks will send a bitch to the store just for a piece of cheesecake like puff did
You jokes cant afford these homes
Look around I got 40 clones now look down that's 40 stones
And that's only in the necklace
I'm bony and I'm reckless (vroom) there's Tony in a Lexus
Im fresh out the gutta scrap whatcha man thought
Im in the hood with more straps than a Jan Sport
I'm So Fly'
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy

When I travel I know Im gonna get stuck
Cause they harass us in the airport like i know wen itz blowin shit up
I got the patience of a high school teacher
with a bright future
why the fuck would I have a bomb on my sneaker

Will the goody girls back of us

My hearts colder than jack frost is
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes and my black forces
A black rose for a rats coffin
Blowin O's in that black coffin
Blowin the road and im back flossin
No one knows how much that's costin
Fuck ass only the green moves me
I got a clean Uzi A pair of gloves and a mask from the scream movie
So if your plottin on poppin off, sceem smoothly
Or get a little red spatter on ya cream coogy
My name ring each state
So you aint gotta go all the way to LA to get ur mc eight
I'm So Fly'
An I've got money so that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm So High'
An I'm on point and I can tell that you jealous by the look in your eye
