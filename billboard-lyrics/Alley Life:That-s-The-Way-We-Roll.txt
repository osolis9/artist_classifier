That-s-The-Way-We-Roll:Alley Life:10:2001-06-23

Welcome to the Mo-Mo
(all right, all right, all right, all right, all right!)
You come and take a ride wit me! Hey, hey!
And that's the way we roll bro!
That's the way we...
Th-That's the way we...
Th-That's the way we.
Hey, that's the way we roll bro!
Welcome to the Mo-Mo

[Verse One]
Whatever you need, best believe
It's starting with Alley
Whether you fiendin' for some greens
Or you starving for patties
And if you (Roll!) well let me tell you what that five gon' get you
As far as (Smoke!) oh my dogg, he gon' fire up wit' you
And if you drink, I'm gonna buy some liqour
I'll make that moonshine shit that'll dry up your liver
I spent the whole day, I'm seein' now how I can get ya
Ya still standin' well, damn I still fire up swisha's
That's how I do it in the (Mo-Mo Baby!) Oh I rarely change
So you know Alley Life gonna keep that Mary Jane man

[chorus]
Five'll get you (Tripped up!)
Ten'll get you (Fixed up!)
Twenty'll get you (Lit up!)
Hey, that's the way we roll, bro!
Thirty'll get you (Touched up!)
Forty'll get you (Sucked up!)
Fifty'll get you (Stuck up!)
Uh oh, welcome to the Mo-Mo
Come and take a ride wit me (Let's Go!)
You not expectin to be live as me, but try something 'cause
Five'll get you (Tripped up!)
Ten'll get you (Fixed up!)
Twenty'll get you (Lit up!)
Hey, that's the way we roll, bro!

[Verse Two]
I want you to take it all off
Nothing dropped in your drink
I want you to do that (yeah girl), go to that
It's not what you think
But when it comes to gettin' nasty
Oh yeah, I'm paying for that
No disrespect I keep it business, I ain't straying from that
But let me tell you, I don't play with that
So when I meet a broad
I'm comin' out the gate with that (Yo, yo, how much?)
If you straight with that
Well dig this here, I'm gonna page you back
Come to your spot and probably blaze a bag
But if I paid you can save the naggin'
Unless you screamin' "Alley Life"
while you praise the thrashin' (right, right)

[chorus]

[Verse Three]
Everybody and they mamma tryin' to up and stop this
I done told ya'll before, man, I ain't got shit
Ain't no bling bling floatin' round in my watches
Since the casinos came, Narc-o's been on my block
I can't mess with no lick if I can't profit
Or have sex with some chick if she ain't topless
I'm a freak, baby, gotta see them things hoppin'
Show me your face girl, let me know the pain's throbbin'
If I paid though, man, get the same options
You can either get game or get bouncin' (bye!)

[chorus]

That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we roll bro!

That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we roll bro!
