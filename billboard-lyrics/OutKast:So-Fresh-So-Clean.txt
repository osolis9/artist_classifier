So-Fresh-So-Clean:OutKast:13:2001-05-05

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

Sir Luscious got gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's
And El Dorado's I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Ralo
So follow it's your time at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepard
What about a hoe in a leopard-print? Teddy Pender-grass cooler
Than Freddie Jackson sippin' a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left my throat warm in the dorm room at the AU we do hey you
And might do some cake too but you must have me mistaken
With them statements that you make 'cause

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean

I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean

Canary yellow seven house of business on display
My nigga Bungle whipped it up so I gone get my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the colorful hideout I'ma show you
How to wild out like Jack Trippa let me be bambino on your snippas
YKK on yo zippa lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard or sober
6 million ways to fold you like Noah I get crews to choose
And you get pretty deep but I'll call yo ass round 8-ish
I know you'll be there for me 'cause

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean

Those huge baby eyes that get to runnin' off at they mouth
Tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say your malnutrition in need of vitamin D
And inviting me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are I love who ya ain't you're so Ann Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
With change and no chains and whips I do suck lips
Till hips jerk and double time the boy next door's a freak

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

(And we are)
The coolest motherfuckers on the planet
(In my mind)
The sky is fallin' ain't no need to panic
(But oh oh)
I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Oh oh oh)
Compatible created in the attic
