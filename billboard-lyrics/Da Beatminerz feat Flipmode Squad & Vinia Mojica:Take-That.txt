Take-That:Da Beatminerz feat Flipmode Squad & Vinia Mojica:4:2001-08-04

Mr. Walt, Evil Dee, Universal
Flipmode, check it out
Ha

My shit is sicker latte
Backing out on niggas up at Jimmy's Cafe
Puerto Rican mamis lookin' like Sole
Take 'em to the crib then I fuck 'em that day
(True)

Kick them bitches out, you know my gun play
(Play)
I'm gansgta, livin' street life everyday
(Day)
Just like Scarface, I still punk the J's
I gotta get mine, that's the America way, now

Jump out the whip, I'm not the type of nigga that trip
Somethin' sick from the nozzle, wanted large when it spit
Hittin' you up, lettin' you bleed in the seat of your truck
And flee the scene when the smoke clear, quiet as fuck

Startin' to lose it, for me that is realer than music
Hold ya plaque up to ya chest and blow right through it
Eight bars on some next shit, probably don't fit
But that don't mean for me to keep quiet and zip up my lips

My real niggas wildin' up in the spot
I know y'all niggas want it what up, what up
(Take that nigga)
To all my bitches gettin' rowdy with us
I know my bitches want it what up, what up
(Take that bitches, take that)

Weak niggas, motherfuckers, all my bitches
(Take that, take that, take that)
Thug niggas, east coast, west coast
(Take that, take that, take that)
Dirty south well if you want it
(Take that, take that)

Gangsta nigga
I lace cats, blooded and sober, fuck who you know of
You don't want it, I push 'em daughter
I told you once I'm grippin' the auto
I tap your jawbone, take your broad home, in a Volvo

It's good I can rap, so you don't catch bullets in your back
And for most that can't see me, I put my foot in they ass
Word, if I catch your ass sleepin' get clapped
Like some applause, I can't afford weak links
I'm too strong, niggas are meek

In a heartbeat I spark the heat
Who wanna start some beef, then catch a hot one in they meat
Turn to savage like a caveman, with the guns blazin'
Executioner style, brains on the pavement

Nigga face it, you thought I live a basement
Thought I'd be dead somewhere, or incarcerated
I'm too slick, FBI suck a dick
Your son is my fan, plus your daughters my bitch

My real niggas wildin' up in the spot
I know y'all niggas want it what up, what up
(Take that nigga)
To all my bitches gettin' rowdy with us
I know my bitches want it what up, what up
(Take that bitches, take that)

Weak niggas, motherfuckers, all my bitches
(Take that, take that, take that)
Thug niggas, east coast, west coast
(Take that, take that, take that)
Dirty south well if you want it
(Take that, take that)

Yeah, with my rhymes hittin'
I specialize, Grimy spittin' more grimy
Than the Lucy with some Chinese chicken
Now your writin' under pressure 'til your fingers start to blister

Lookin' like some shit on the neck from rusty flippers
In my BM, fillin' the tank with my Pediem, call 'em as I see 'em
Underground swingin' to the Masters
Tigers Woods liked the goods, tried to turn a new leaf
Just can't fight the hood

Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na
Now let me rip it right, will hit y'all with the
Big, gigantic, over-sized, Bladow
It's so amazing how we stuff shit up

How we blaze it, and we fuck shit up
Like when the bitch give me head
And I bust and she suck shit up
Like a motherfuckin' suctioncup

So turn this motherfuckin' truck shit up
While I be spillin' this shit with no remorse
See how we killin' this shit

My real niggas wildin' up in the spot
I know y'all niggas want it what up, what up
(Take that nigga)
To all my bitches gettin' rowdy with us
I know my bitches want it what up, what up
(Take that bitches, take that)

Weak niggas, motherfuckers, all my bitches
(Take that, take that, take that)
Thug niggas, east coast, west coast
(Take that, take that, take that)
Dirty south well if you want it
(Take that, take that)
