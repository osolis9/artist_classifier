So-Many-Girls:DJ Drama feat Wale, Tyga & Roscoe Dash:21:2013-03-30

Verse 1:
(It's goin down tonight baby)
I got sand all in my bath water
Candles by my wine glass
Women all on my time
Imagine how my time pass
They say them freaks come out at night
And you know who they came to see
Even though she ain't mine, I fucked her like her man to be

Chorus:
So many girls in here tonight (x2)
I'm just looking for the right one
Exotic as they might come
Then I leave with two, cause really I don't like one
So many girls in here tonight

Verse 2:
Light skinned, dark skinned, sit your fine ass right there
Come join at my table and don't question when tonight end
Toss a couple dollars and she down for whatever
Don't make no promises, but promise I could fuck you better
Fuck that singing shit, I be the shit
That YM too legit to quit
You thinking that you better than that Venus and Serena shit
I'm all up up on my latest chick, she saying this that greatest dick
I 1, 2 stroke her, we caught up in the moment, ayyyyy
T-t-t-t-turn up, V-12 and I burn up
My chick, that fly bitch, and your bitch unheard of
4AM and we still poppin bottles
Probably have a new chick tomorrow cause there's

[Chorus]

Verse 3:
(Wale doe)
I put my problems in this pitcher, got a bucket full of liquor
And I know ya'll got that bad bitch, but I got way too many niggas
Put your phone up, Tyga got some roll up
Loud pack with your bad ass, cause these good girls just ain't no fun
Double cup and i'm slowed up, smoking dub with my chauffeur
Sneaker fly, cleaner style and i'm the reason why you niggas phoned up
New York and Miss slow bucks, DC got that old cup
Hold up, these niggas want no bunk
Straight shot sippah, I ain't mixing my liquor
Bitch I'm not kidding, ya'll some Fisher-Price niggas
And we some life livers
Hoping that this life give us a lot of money, success, and the women to ride with us
Ambition

[Chorus]
