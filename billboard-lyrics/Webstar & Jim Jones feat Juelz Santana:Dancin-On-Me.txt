Pull up to the club she dancing on me
I don't really know what she doing to me
But I really know how she really want me
I'm like girl you dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
I don't know about you but she dancing on me
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl,
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
DJ WEBSTAR: Cop that bottle
pop that bottle shake that bottle
Then pour it on a model
You follow
Now do your little dance like a genie in a bottle
Shawty ain't letting me leave,
When I move she move she ain't letting me breath
Shawty ain't letting me leave,
When I move she move she ain't letting me breath
Pull up to the club
she dancing on me
I don't really know what she doing to me
But I really know how she really want me
I'm like girl you dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
I don't know about you but she dancing on me
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl,
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
JIM JONES: If being fine was a crime you'd be serving it dime
Her brains were the same she said I'm all on her mind
Watching her every move and stalking her body parts
The way I might attack her she might need a body guard
The jewels had her like gosh
Champagne to us is nothing but mouth wash
You get it from your momma
Shake what she gave ya
Drop it like it's hot, I couldn't take this behavior
Pull up to the club and the lambo was looking sweet
Don't know about you but her hands was on me
Then she start to feel that the hammer was on me
But she wanted to lick the rapper like candy was on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
I don't know about you but
she dancing on me
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
JUELZ SANTANA: Grind on me
Wind on me
Now turn around and
put your behind on me
Now grind on me
Now grind on me
Now lemme take you home
you could ride on me
See ladies love me
Girls they adore me
The Haters hate me
but they can't avoid me
She wanna get kinky
She's all on me
I wanna get freaky, me so horny ay

So I whispered in her ear like what is we gonna do
She looked at her friend and I'm like she could come too
All three of us should get one room and do things we like to do ay
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
Dancing on me, she dancing on me
I don't know about you but she dancing on me
Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl, Go girl
Shake your little diggy dum dum dum
Shake your little diggy dum dum dum
De dum dum diggy dum dum dum
De dum dum
Show me what ya momma gave ya
Show me what ya momma gave ya
Hapala de deg dum dum duaahla
Pull up to the club she dancing on me
I don't really know what she doing to me
But I really know how she really want me
I'm like girl your dancing on me
Dancing on me, She dancing on me
Dancing on me, She dancing on me
Dancing on me, She dancing on me
I don't know about you but she dancing on me
