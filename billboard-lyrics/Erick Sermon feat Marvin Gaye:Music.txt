Music:Erick Sermon feat Marvin Gaye:4:2001-09-08

Just like music
There's no doubt, no doubt, no doubt
Word up
Oh baby
Just like music

To relax my mind, so I can be free
And absorb sound that keep me 'round
Doin' my thang, constantly with no worries
Peace to Keith Murray
Just like music

To keep me flowin' and keep me goin'
And keep me growin', and keep me the E from knowin'
What happens out there is not my concern
You wanna die, it's not my turn
Just like music

To do somethin' to me like jump in the Mercedes
On the highway, doin' over eighty
Without music, baby
I'll go crazy, just like music

Make me call my homey on the phone
Like there's somethin' new out, that got me in the zone
Just that feelin', got me I wish music can adopt me
Just like music

Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Just like music

Put me in the mood with my woman
Got me in the ear, sayin' sweet nothings
Make love come out the mouth, no frontin'
Like all of a sudden
Just like music

Takin' away your worries and cares
Any problems, music will be right there
Together match yo, we a perfect pair
Is that true Marvin?
Yeah, music

Yo, to get you to bang this
Body soul snatcher, universal language
It be the light, so open up
This is it, what the fuck?
Just like music

One fly tune
That have black and white vibe in one room
No confrontation, parlay all night
It's just the sensation
Just like music

Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Just like music

Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a happy day
Just like music
Music makes a cloud flow by, baby
Your music is my tears inside my eyes
Just like music

Your music makes me want to sing
Girl, music is a joy to bring
Just like music
Music is my heart and soul
More precious than gold
Turn on some music, I got my music
Happiness for days, justice all the way

Turn on some music, I got my music
I love your music baby, I got my music
Turn on some music, I got my music
Just like music
Turn on some music, turn on some music
Just like music
Turn on some music, turn on some music
Just like music
Turn on some music, turn on some music
Just like music
