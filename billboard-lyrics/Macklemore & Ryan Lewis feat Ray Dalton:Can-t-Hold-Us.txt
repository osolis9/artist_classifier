Can-t-Hold-Us:Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat Ray Dalton:1:2013-11-30

Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you
Come on in, let's go

Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright, okay, uh
Alright, okay, alright, okay

Return of the Mack, get 'em
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up

Thrift Shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yup

Bad, moonwalking, and this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it, and yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track buzzing, halfway cross that city
With the backpack, fat cat, crushin'

Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country

Labels out here
Now they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

Y'all can't stop me
I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week

Raw, tell me go up, gone
Deuces goodbye, I've got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing that song and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility, and now we keep marching, I said

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Let's go
Na na na na na na na na
Heeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Heeey, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Oooh, and all my people say
Na na na na na na na na
Mack-le oh oh oh oh oooh

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
