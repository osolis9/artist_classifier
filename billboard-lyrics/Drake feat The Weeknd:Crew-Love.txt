Crew-Love:Drake feat The Weeknd:14:2012-08-11

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of n**gas
What you following me for?
This ain't no f**king sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20's keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta girls, first flight from Poland

Why? cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
they loving the crew
oh, they loving the crew
oh, they loving the crew
they loving the crew

they loving the crew

they loving in the crew
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces, all it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest n**gas say your lyrics do s**t for me
I told my story, then made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20

I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing

That OVO and XO is everything you believe in, I know
They loving the crew,
oh they loving the crew

oh they loving the crew,
they loving the crew
oh

oh, they loving the crew,
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
they loving the crew
oh
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
If you broadcast swag, n**ga we the news in the city
