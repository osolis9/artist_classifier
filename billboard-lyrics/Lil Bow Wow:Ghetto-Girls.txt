To the B now, let's talk about it
Ghetto girls
See what we like around here it's them ghetto girls
Ghetto girls
Hey yo bow, tell em' what I'm talkin' 'bout

Like when Janet was justice that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
A shorty that can tell ya when the J's come out
Get creative with the hair cuts like T boz
Favorite rappers is bow wow, snoop, JD and nas
Always up in somebody's face tryin' to fuss
And to get where she going she can take the bus
Like when Jada was peaches in the movie shame
Hard to find her time to be sittin' at the trucker's game
They only like dealin' wit cats that love to floss
Only like rockin' the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinin', tattoos on the back
Attitude like Mary J, mixed wit Brat
You can find 'em at a beauty shop, mall or church
Name brand hat, shoes, with the matching purse
So all that sedity stuff, y'all can keep
'Cuz only girls that keep it ghetto that can ride wit me fo' sho

Ghetto girls
They like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball wit the best of them
Ghetto girls
They rock braids and do 'em straight
And in the kitchen fix da bomb kool aid
Ghetto girls
They think they can hang and talk more slang than I do
Ghetto girls
That's all I like so tell me baby
Is that you?

Bow wow let's talk about it
When they ride wit for man like you won't believe
Switch the color on the hair like E V E
When they talk like I talk
But walk like a lady
Snap like I snap and get a little crazy
I love that
Specially when they 'bout the cheese
The type that pull front on some Mickey D's
Bandanas to barrettes
Daisy dukes to spandex
All that's good wit me
I like 'em G H E T T O
Now believe me she got to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From choo choos to rice krispies treats on my street
That's all I see like everyday
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say, ya heard
