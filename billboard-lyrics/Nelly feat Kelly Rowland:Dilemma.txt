Dilemma:Nelly feat Kelly Rowland:1:2003-01-18

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my Boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my Boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing I'll ever see
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son, oh-oh, but that's okay
Cause I, wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up everything mami hittin'
And in no time I better make this friend mine and that's for sure
Cause I never been the type to break up a happy home
But there's something 'bout baby girl, I just can't leave her 'lone
So tell me, ma, what's it gonna be
She said, You don't know what you mean to me, come on

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my Boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my Boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

I see a lot in your look and I never say a word
I know how start actin trippin , and hate up all the girls
And there's no way Nelly gon' fight over
No dame, as you could see
But I like your steeze, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holler, and swoop me in his two-seater
Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya, don't you forget it
But it ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him
But you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that and right before I turned to leave
She said, You don't know what you mean to me, come on

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my Boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my Boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do
And it's more than you'll ever know
Boy, it's for sure
You can always count on my love
Forever more, yeah, yeah
