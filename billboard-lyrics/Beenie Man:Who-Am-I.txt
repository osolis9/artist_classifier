Who-Am-I:Beenie Man:6:1998-09-12

Yes nyah, cool nuh Iyah
Who am I? Just the girls dem sugar
Alright
Hear yah nuh

Sim Simmer, who got the keys to my Bimmer
Who am I? The girls dem sugar
How can I make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi di keys to my truck
Who am I? Di girls dem luck
And I and I will make love to Precious but

Yuh ever buck a gal whey deep like bucket
Draw fi yuh needle an yuh needle caan stitch it
Draw fi yuh axe and like a cow yuh all a chop it
Draw fi yuh pickaxe and like a rung yuh all a dig it

Is like a riverside up pon di banking yuh tek it
Is like a bicycle suh yuh hold it and dash it
Now yuh wash it, suh yuh crash it she a tell yuh say yuh crabbit
Gal she a beg yuh an a bawl seh yuh fi stop it

Badman plug in, a mi a move like electric
Is like a basketball, she tek time out fi vomit
Unuh listen to mi style an unuh listen to mi lyrics
A Beenie Man deh yah, mi a drop it, a seh

Sim Simmer, who got the keys to my Bimmer
Who am I? The girls dem sugar
How can I make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi di keys to my truck
Who am I? Di girls dem luck
And I and I will make love to Precious

But anything she want I will give it unto she
I can't believe di day mi friend dem tell mi dat she flee
I don't believe it's angry and I don't believe it's grief
I don't believe it's Susan or the other girls I breed

The love for me she have, that is the only thing I need
I don't think den right now just to lose my main squeeze
Oh, Guantanamera yuh a killer
Gal the way yuh hot yuh have mi body under pressure

Man see yuh body all a kill mosquito
Hold yuh body right just fi know yuh the power

Sim Simmer, who got the keys to my Bimmer

And I and I will make love to Precious but

I tell myself I don't want anybody else
To ever love me
You are my guiding star, my shining light
I love you baby

But that day you leave and yuh gone
I know that girls, they going crazy
I know the girls lumpsome all a dem a run come
'Cause di whole a dem want dis baby

I told you once and I told you twice
That I am the girls dem sugar
Now the girls dem attack mi and di girls dem a rush mi
Because dem a drive inna mi Bimmer

A di girls dem flavor, I am no slave
I am the helper, no paper
And a girl just watch yah
A want unnuh hear yah an listen wheh di DJ a seh

Sim Simmer, pass me the keys to my Bimmer
Who am I? The girls dem sugar
How can I make love to a fellow?
In a rush, pass mi di keys to my truck
