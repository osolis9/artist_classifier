Get 'em
Do you know what time it is?
Tell me do ya know?
Do you know what time it is?
Tell me do ya know?
Do you know what time it is?
Tell me do ya know?
Do you know what time it is?
Swizzy

I said, "Come on"
I said, "Come on"
I said, "Come on"

You gettin' money, homie? Show me if it's like that
You on the grind? Then you know it's really like that
Dudes who snitch, naw, I don't really like that
I don't condone the chrome where the wall at

Swizz slow down the beat, it's all love
Slow motion for me like your ass is screwed up
Make you move like The Matrix when dude was duckin' slugs
Bleek to black sheep mami, now pick it up

Hey, back to gettin' money, keep it gully, where my niggaz at?
Stuntin' its nothin', I'm pushin' somethin' new every day
Back on the grind, keep easy on your mind
I'm one of a kind, the tops the bottom line

Throw a hand in the air, if it's like that
Throw a little paper out, if it's like that
Tell the chick to come here, if it's like that
Buy the whole fuckin' bar, if it's like that

Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that

Yo, aye yo, the watch is like that, the dough is like that
Bracelet, the bronzes, I ball just like that
Coupe on lows, know you all gon' like that
Sit so right, at least 4 gon' fall back

Dude stop frontin', problems, you don't want that
9 mm hollows I does that
When it comes to gettin' paper my life stack
Hoes are slut, niggas gon' like that

Then I go expose 'em and show 'em that's how we live, hey
Mami know we holdin' cause all of us got a 6
Rocafella the crew, you know we do it like that
Niggaz can't imitators, but you ain't quite like that

Throw a hand in the air if it's like that
Throw a little paper out if it's like that
Tell the chick to come here if it's like that
Buy the whole fuckin' bar if it's like that

Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that

You know I move with the snub, 'cause I'm like that
You don't really want beef, you ain't like that
Ma, come here, yeah, tell me if it's like that
And move the body real slow just like that

When Swizz slows down the beat it's all love
Slow motion for me like your ass is screwed up
Make it move like The Matrix when dude was duckin' slugs
Bleek the black sheep, mami now pick it up

Aye back on the grizzy with Swizzy back on the beat, hey
Rocafella the label the talk is to cease, decease
I'm here to kill 'em again, you fill 'em again
If the enemy ain't dead, we hit 'em again, pop

Throw a hand in the air if it's like that
Throw a little paper out if it's like that
Tell the chick to come here if it's like that
Buy the whole fuckin' bar if it's like that

Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
Hey hey, tell me if it's like that
