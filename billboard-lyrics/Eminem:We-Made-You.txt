We-Made-You:Eminem:19:2009-04-25

Guess who, did you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
   (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?

Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just 'cause he asked to put his hands

On her massive Gluteus Maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can can, don't ask me this again

He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2, you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact I see a grin
Now come in, girl

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charley Horse her
Sorry Portia but what's Ellen DeGeneres have that I don't?
Are you telling me tenderness?

Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend

Brit forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middle man
Forget him or you're gonna end up in hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention

And little bit did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

And that's why my love you'll never live without
I know you want me, girl, 'cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you

Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad? You should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia

Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breast in my mouth bruh
Wowzers! I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis

Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about to flip, Jessica
Rest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya

Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
Now break it down girl

When you walk through the door it was clear to me
  (Clear to me)
You're the one they adore, who they came to see
  (Who they came to see)
You're a rock star everybody wants you
  (Baby, everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you?
  (Who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you

So baby
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Oh Amy, rehab never looked so good
I can wait, I'm going back, ha ha, woo!
Dr. Dre, 2020, yeah
