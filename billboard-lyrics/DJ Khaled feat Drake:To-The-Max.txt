I talk grey, I don't keep it white and black
Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no
Like the album just went platinum, yeah
Turnt up to the max
If they pop somebody's chain then we gotta get it back
No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that
Man, we lit

My youngins lit
All of my youngins, yeah we lit

All of my youngins, yeah we lit

Oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I do
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Oh, oh, fessi-ession 'fessions too
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Oh, oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I too
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Oh, oh, fessi-ession, do come true
Back it up, back it up

Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Get 'em right, get 'em right

Got it on the dresser, I've been under pressure
They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher
Gotta keep my head up
Get 'em right, get 'em right
Excuse me, Gus
Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins
I keep hearin' all this "You my brother" talk, I can't relate to nothin'
My broski down to ride
Made a knot in the line
You can never break ties
We don't really rate those yutes there
That's a whole other side
That's a whole 'nother vibe
They ain't really on shit, yeah


All of my youngins, yeah we lit

Oh, oh, fessi-ession 'fessions too
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Oh, oh, 'fessions to, I do, I, I too
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Oh, oh, fessi-ession, do come true
