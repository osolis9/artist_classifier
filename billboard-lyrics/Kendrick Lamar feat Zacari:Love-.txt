Love-:Kendrick Lamar feat Zacari:9:2017-09-09

Damn
Love or lust
Damn
All of us

Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sipping bubbly, feeling lovely, living lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you

If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothing

Ay, I got something (I got something)
Hol' up, we gon' function, no assumptions
Feeling like Tyson wit' it, knock it out out twice
I'm with it, only for the night, I'm kidding
Only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean, I know what comin' over mean
Backstroke oversea, I know what you need
Already on ten, our money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end

If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothing

Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sipping bubbly, feeling lovely, living lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you

I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Popping your gum on the way
Am I in the way?
I don't want to pressure you none
I want your blessing today
Oh by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude for your nanny
Curvin' your hit from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yup

If didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)
If I made up my mind at work would you still (love me)
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothing

Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sipping bubbly, feeling lovely, living lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you
