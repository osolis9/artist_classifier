Monster:Kanye West feat Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Bon Iver & Nicki Minaj:15:2011-01-29

I shoot the lights out
Hide till it's bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no good blood sucker
Fat muthaf-cker, now look who's in trouble
as you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles

Kanye West sample, here's one for example

Gossip gossip
n-ggas just stop it

everybody know (I'm a muthaf-cking monster)
I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert

I'ma need to see your f-cking hands at the concert

profit profit, n-gga I got it

The best living or dead hands down huh?
less talk more head right now huh?
and my eyes more red than the devil is

and I'm bout to take it to another level bitch
Du'n't who you go and get, aint nobody cold as this
do the rap and the track triple double no assist
and my only focus is staying on some bogus sh-t

argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her sh-t
I heard the people sayin' raps are gettin' trap, mayne
bought the chain that always give me back pain
f-ckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
Chi n-gga but these hoes love my accent
she came up to me and said this the number 2 gal
if you wanna make it number one your number 2 now
this that goose an' malibu I call it Malibooya
God damn Yeezy How I hit em with the new style
know that muthaf-cker well, what you gone do now
whatever ever I wanna do, gosh its cool now
nah gonna do, Raaawr its a new now
think yo muthaf-cker really really need to cool down
cause you will never get on top of this
so mommy best advice is just to get on top of this
have you ever had sex with a pharaoh
I put the p-ssy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus
head of the class and she just want a swallow ship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
my presence is a present kiss my ass

everybody wanna know what my achilles heel is
LOVE I dont get enough of it
all I get is these vampires and blood suckers
all I see is these n-ggas I've made millionnaires

Pull up in a monster

hairdresser from Milan, thats the monster 'doo
monster Giuseppe heel that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and the monster crew
and I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
and if I'm fake I aint notice cause my money aint
So let me get this straight, wait I'm the rookie?
but my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out!
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
hotter than a middle eastern climate
find it Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it
while it, Nicki on them titties, wanna I sign it?
how these n-ggas so one-track minded
but really really I don't give a F-U-C-K

she's on a diet but my pockets eating cheese cake
and I'll say bride of Chucky is Child's play
just killed another career it's a mild day
besides ‘Ye they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am (Amber Rose) should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whip lash
I think big, get cash, make ‘em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaahhh, I'm a muthaf-cking monster!
I-I crossed the line-line
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
So I-I am headed home
I-I crossed the line-line
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
So I-I am headed home
I-I crossed the line-line
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
So I-I am headed home
