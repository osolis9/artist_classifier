How-Come:D12:18:2004-09-04

So I changed huh?
You got a phone, pick it up, call me

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

We were so young, so full of life and vivrance side by side
Wherever you was ridin' I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side with a shoulder to cry on
A tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours?

And mine I survived it, you ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then I blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold to touch it's just like ice
In your eyes is the look of resentment
I can sense it, and I don't like it

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

It was my dream at first to be on spittin' a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
So I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
Before I let him disrespect me and check me over some worst
Some bitch that I wasn't with I would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved wit her, you was smokin' the chron with her
Comin' out of the bar with her stumblin' half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or somethin'

But me catchin' her fuckin' other niggers
Must've hurt you pride or somethin'
'Cuz you went off at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all I tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You actin' like I ain't ya man and lyin' like she can't be loose
But I am really you friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that is changing is you

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

Its gettin' only at the top 'cuz my homie had to stop
Now we actin' like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude
Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and 'poof' it just happen
But Proof is just actin' out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my baby's ain't starvin' at home

See the devil in your grin since the ghetto we been friends
Forever real intelligence thats forever till the end
I keep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wastin' my times with these snakes in disguise
How come, when you talk its with bitter respite?
And how come, it's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape-vine we even beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you
