Party rock, yeah, woo, let's go
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya, shake that

In the club party rock looking for your girl?
She on my jock huh non stop when we in the spot
Booty move away like she on the block
Where the drink I got's to know
Top jeans tattoo cause I'm rock and roll
Half black half white domino, gang of money out the door

Yo, I'm runnin' through these hoes like Draino
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo
We party rock, yeah that's the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top no lead in our zeppelin, hey

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya, shake that

Everyday I'm shufflin' shufflin' shufflin'
Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money don't be mad now stop, hatin' is bad

One more shot for us another round
Please fill up my cup don't mess around
We just wanna see you shake it now
Now you wanna be you're naked now
