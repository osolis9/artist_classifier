My-Hitta:YG feat Jeezy & Rich Homie Quan:3:2014-04-12

I said that I'ma ride for my motherf*cking hittas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I been grinding outside, all day with my hittas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas (my m******** hittas)
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas

First things first, I love all of my hittas
This rap shit crack, then I involve my hittas
You looking for some lean, let me call my hittas
He sell it for the high, I need all my hittas
Some hittas smoke, smoke some hittas drink, drink
Got hittas on the block with the glock they don't think
That's a hitta back up, they in the bucket lapped up
I got thst act right if you hittas wanna act up
He talking like a snitch, no that ain't my hittas
He trippin off a bitch, no, that ain't my hittas
Take a hitta case, shit, that's my hittas
Know him since I was 8, yeah, that's my hittas
F*cked my first bitch passed her to my hittas
Hit my first lick pass with my hittas
F*ck them other hittas 'cause I'm down for my hittas

I ride for my hittas, f*ck them other hittas

I said that I'ma ride for my motherf*cking hittas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I been grinding outside, all day with my hittas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas

My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas

You know I'm down with the hittas down for me
I got two words for you, love and loyalty
It's me and my hittas tripping on a half of bean
We used to hit up wall and buy everything you see
Me and my down ass hitta getting twisted
Nigga get to tripping he knock the gravy, out your biscuit
Jay know I f*ck with you the long way, my hittas
So when I see you out I'm like hey, my hittas
Tried to act right, buy the case with my hittas

Drink the act right and get straight with my hittas
Me and my hittas riding dirty, tryna chase them figures
Who got the yola? who got the yola? Don't matter, go figure

I said that I'ma ride for my motherf*cking hittas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I been grinding outside, all day with my hittas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my hittas

My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas

My hittas got kick, my hittas got weight
My hittas fronted me, he the reason I'm straight
My hittas got a house, my hittas got a lake
My hittas we eatin, my hittas get a plate
You still here listening, my hittas, my hittas
Knock a hitta off his shit, my hittas, my hittas
I f*ck a hitta bitch with my hittas, my hittas
If a hitta talking shit then he ain't my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
YG my hittas and I ain't going in they

Tryna leave my hittas, shawty see me and wanna leave with a hitta
But it wasn't enough room 'cause I came with my hittas
My hittas, my hittas, I need to settle in 'cause I'm too fly, hitta
And I'm all about my business like a suit and tie, hitta
I'll ride for my hittas believe dat
I said that I'ma ride for my motherf*cking hittas
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I been grinding outside, all day with my hittas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
My hittas, my hittas
