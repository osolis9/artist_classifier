The-Illest:Far East Movement & Riff Raff:18:2014-04-19

[Intro:]
We be the illest...
We be the illest in here...
I know you feel us...
We be the illest in here...
Illest in here...
We so motherfuckin' I'll...
We so motherfuckin' I'll...
I'll, motherfucker, I'll...
We so motherfuckin' I'll...

[Verse 1:]
Illin' out from LA - I be illin' out all the way
Got an email from my K-Town chick that wanna hook up and blaze
I've got OG cannabis, girl, one puff'll put you in your grave
Got three pills and four Jimmy hats 'cause we don't Kid 'n Play
Hop out, yo, guess who's gettin' drunk?
No motherfuckers can out-drink us
If you're tipping that heat, don't get drowned
So cold, polar bears on my nuts
Y'all know just who we be
I hold it down for the East
'Cause I keeps it pimpin', Peter Griffin
Yellow tinted on zebras

[Bridge:]
Dripping on your couches
Dripping on your couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with orange, mane, we on that Tropicana
I'm dripping on your couches from the Hills to public housing
If you're feelin' ill, then damn, you ill
Be the illest on the thousand

[Hook:]
We be the illest...
We be the illest in here...
I know you feel us...
We be the illest in here...
Illest in here...
Illest...
We be the illest in here...
I know you feel us...
We be the illest in here...
Illest in here...
We so motherfuckin' ill...

[Verse 2: Riff]
Nice chain... what a nice night
My ice bright, I play the wall like a night light
Tangerine, tambourine from the West Wing
The best thing about my new Versace bed springs
I'm in the building, more gold than Rumpelstiltskin
Aw shit, look who it is, the white Russell Simmons
JODY HiGHROLLER - Far East Movement
We so ill, I think I need some Codeine fluid

[Outro:]
"I" is for the way these bitches love how I bang
And double "L" is for the way I blow the smoke in your face
We roll on Es and we be easy - rollin' that bank
And "ST" is for the illest shit we rep every day
