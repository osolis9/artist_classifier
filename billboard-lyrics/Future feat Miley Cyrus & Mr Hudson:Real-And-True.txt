Real-And-True:Future feat Miley Cyrus & Mr Hudson:23:2014-01-04

Why did we go all the way
What do we do Ohh when it rains
(Mike Will Make It) Oh
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view

Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career

You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real

And I can't even lie dawg, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And I'mma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live

Aye just do me this favor, give it time, time reveals
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view

Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine

Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough

But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time
When the sun dies (when the sun dies) and the stars fade from view (from view oh)

Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant (through the distance) and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need

I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin' oh
When the sun dies (when the sun dies!) and the stars fade from view (Oh Yeah)
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant (through the distant) and cold depths of space (yeah yeah)
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
