One-Mic:Nas:9:2002-06-29

All I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151
One sip'll make a nigga flip
Writing names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up
The cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricocheting between the spots that I'm hiding in
Blacking out as I shoot back, fuck getting hit
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the star, sun, and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience
Leaving victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga the time is now

All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic

All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer â€“ tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back, at all the hatred against me: fuck all of them
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holding 17
27 hit your crew, 6 went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime
Hope your funeral
Never gets shot up
Bullets tear through the innocent
Nothing is fair
Niggas roll up, shooting from wheelchairs
My heart is racing, tasting revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of Macs, too many nines
If y'all niggas really with me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothing in our way
They bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flying, feel it
I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
Cause we stronger now my nigga, the time is now

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself
They don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talking all that slick shit
The same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blasting, cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashing
War gets deep, some beef is everlasting
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifing each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed, body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwing dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Should've knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blinding, I never make the same mistakes
Moving with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swelling my melon cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were telling police, how can a kingpin squeal
This is crazy, I'm on the right track
I'm finally found
You need some soul-searching
The time is now
