Tell-Me-What-s-Goin-On-:Smilez & Southstar:10:2003-03-22

Yeah, this right here
It's goin’ out to all dem girls out there
That did me and South wrong, ya know
Tell y'all a lil' story, it's da reason
(Uh, uh)

Love, hate, mistakes
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Debates all day
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Too late heart break
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
What's goin’ on, what's goin’ on

Hey yo, me and miss thang we were the perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples feign
Love, trust, good sex and security
If you ever felt weak Smilez was your energy

Trips across seas showed you the finer things
No more Burger King it was fine dine cuisine
And if we never had it, I don't think it mattered
We were a class A like Nas and Illmatic

I was so deceived, I thought we had a thing
Used to blow my two way up with one, four, three’s
The L O V had me blind I wouldn't of seen
I trusted my friends all they were yellin' at me

How could you do me so wrong, I don't wanna get gone
I invested three years ma plus this song
I’m so confused where to go, how do I choose
I guess to find real love I gotta pay my dues

Love, hate, mistakes
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Debates all day
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Too late heart break
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
What's goin’ on, what's goin’ on

It seemed so good, yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in my heart like no body could
And all alone we stood when times was hard
Even before I wrote this rap shit, you made me a star

When I was workin' two jobs just to survive
When I felt like killin' myself you kept me alive
What a pair, me and you, we was a match
Different taste but ya know opposites attract

By my side held my head and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out where the hell we went wrong
I deal what I can young cat being a man
Stayed an' weathered the storm when most would a ran

Too much pride and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself now I had a turn at these rhymes
It's the only way I know to release my mind

Love, hate, mistakes
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Debates all day
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Too late heart break
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
What's goin’ on, what's goin’ on

It's been a while, yeah, you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though some things still don't pass
Sit back in the pad think about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad or make me mad

I'm tryin' to move on with my life the wound is healed
Yeah, I'm just speakin' it real, I'm ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed
A man now bet you can't believe it's me

You ruined a good thing and all of our dreams
Tryin' to lock me down a life time in the bing
Monitorin' my calls, grippin' at my dogs shit
I never really understood the cost

My friends were your friends, your friends were my friends
Your dough was my dough, my dough is my dough
And Mano a Mano we’ll foot this weather
And everybody that been through it then sing it together
(Come on)

Love, hate, mistakes
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
(What you think, uh)
Debates all day
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
(What's goin' on girl)
Too late heart break
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
(What you think ma)
What's goin’ on, what's goin’ on

Love, hate, mistakes
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
(What you think, uh)
Debates all day
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
(What's goin' on girl)
Too late heart break
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
(What you think ma)
What's goin’ on, what's goin’ on
