Made-Me:Snootie Wild feat K Camp:21:2014-12-13

Late night candy creepin'
With yo' demo lick
Servin', swervin' On the highway
And i'm doing bout 80
I can see you haters talkin'
But it do not phase me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
(Aye aye aye)
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
I done ate up out that mud
And it taste like gravy
All I try to do is flip the 4 into a baby
All I wanna do is flip the 4 to feed my babies
See I know these niggas watchin'
And these niggas hate me
Cause I came from nothing nigga
Now they see this kid done made it
See me pulling in the projects in that nihilator
See yo' eye candy I eat her like a now and later
Choppa choppa, a nigga dead and make him peculator
Real choppin' down the block just like a alligator
All this kush done turned my eye red like I'm terminator
Holla' at amigo, call plug a elevate ya'
I'm a spiffy nigga
Yeah affiliated
Orchestrated with my mob and it's so amazing
Hundred, fifty, twenties, all I see is paper
Smokin' on Jamaica
You get wrong you meet ya' maker
Poppin' bottles, shout out to my haters
You my motivater, that's why we be motivated
All this gwalla, all black like them Raiders
Runnin' in yo' shit
We ain't gone quit, until we take 'em
(Aye aye aye)
Only if you know
Broke no joke (joke)
Coming from the ghetto
Not no mo' (no')
Always on go mode
Tic tac toe (aye)
Light it up yo' hoe
