Up in the club, fuck VIP
P to the I, I to the T
Ying to the Yang up in this thang
D to the roc, my nigga Kaine

Up in the cut, pouring it up
Rolling it up, holding it up
Ain't her ass swollen or what?
Yes sir, yes sir

Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be that makes me 2 live for your crew
Hoe, get down get low
I'm crossin' these mammas like tic tac toe

Let's ride let's go
Get loose get crunk, get drunk get blown
That's right let's roll
MIA ATL fo sho

Shake shake, just shake shake

That hoe's fine but but but but this one's a killa
That hoe's fine but but but but this one's a killa

All the lil mamas all around the world
Shake that ass if you a nasty girl
Back that ass up says Juvenile
Show a nigga some titties like Girls Gone Wild
Show a nigga some titties like Girls Gone Wild
Show a nigga some titties like Girls Gone Wild

Take off this strip of clothes, I wanna see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down the yellow brick road
Where niggaz go to see naked hoes

Shake that shit bitch
Have me off in the club with a hard ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit

Put a hump in your back and lick it raw
To a 3 point stance put your fist up her ass
You must be on the Kanye work out plan
Like head, shoulders, knees, hoes

Shake shake, just shake shake
Just shake shake
Just shake, chica shake shake
Shake shake, just shake shake
Just shake shake
Just shake, chica shake shake

Take 'em out in they jeans, take 'em out all dressed
Is the realest two niggaz out the ATL
Yeah we break it down, betta shake a booty hoe
And the hoes in the club with the real tight clothes

One time for the gang with the Ying Yang tip
We already know we off the reel
Don't tolerate that talkin'
Bitch you can get the walkin'
Patron is what I'm groaking
The only way that we gonna talkin'

If your breath smells like mine
Girl I don't give a fuck â€˜cause you fine
I diss 'em fo I kiss 'em
I pack 'em fo I stack 'em
So while we in the club betta get these girls
'Cause on the streets there ain't no action
