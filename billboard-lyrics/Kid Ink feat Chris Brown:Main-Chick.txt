Main-Chick:Kid Ink feat Chris Brown:7:2014-09-20

I told her fuck that nigga

Mustard on the beat ho

I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her Fuck that nigga

We sitting in the back of the club
Table got a rope in the front (I don't know ya)
You looking real familiar, I could just be a lil' drunk
I don't know your name, it's a goddamn shame
I don't know how to explain it for ya
But, girl, I'm just saying
If you got a man back home, I don't know him
What, just keep it on the hush
Pocket full of trees, don't beat around the bush
Walk on green, I can even hear the putt
K.O shawty when I hit her with a punchline
Get a couple shots when it's crunch time
Ducking from my ex like a one time
Throw a sign when you really tryn' go
Got the car parked right at the door

I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her Fuck that nigga

Nah, and you don't know my name, no
Just in case you' the feds; I don't know ya
I might'a poured you a drink
But don't let it go to your head
I know why you came
Tryna be my main chick
Passenger side when I lane switch
Top back, two seats only
Ain't no room for your friends, I don't know them
We just seizing the moment
Up all night, throw a deuce to the morning (wait)
Fly mo'fucka, everything is imported (wait)
Don't try to act too important
I know your game
You got a gang of niggas, all over you
But you all over here, on me
Girl, I ain't tryna dog ya
Bad bitch only thing I'll call you

I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her Fuck that nigga

Baby, why you playing? You heard my name
I know why you came
She gonna gimme that brain so we can do our thang
Let's do that thang
What you thinking 'bout me taking you down, yeah
I can be your man when he's not around, yeah

I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her Fuck that nigga
