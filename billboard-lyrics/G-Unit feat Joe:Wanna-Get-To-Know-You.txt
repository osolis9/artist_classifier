Wanna-Get-To-Know-You:G-Unit feat Joe:5:2004-05-29

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy

I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizin' my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi, then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feelin' like, 'maybe she the wrong woman'
Think I'ma be chasin' the chicken head, you on somethin'
Your toes painted, half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Make the decision, Shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home, I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on
Holla at yo boy

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy

Bitches be frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoyin' from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' n' moving cruisin' after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with a frame and to make her feel special
I let her call me by my governor name
Her panties wet over fame fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your homie

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy

Yeah now, what would fuck me up more watchin' her lick her lips
Or watchin' her walk, she hypnotize me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right
Look I'm legit now, used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours
Big house, big Benz, girl, its yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause there be some honeys gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here, let my touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night, we can have a balla night

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I will understand you baby
I wanna be your lover
I will understand you baby
