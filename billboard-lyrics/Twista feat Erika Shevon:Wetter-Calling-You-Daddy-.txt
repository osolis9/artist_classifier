Wetter-Calling-You-Daddy-:Twista feat Erika Shevon:3:2009-11-07

I'm callin' ya daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy, daddy
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy, daddy
Come and make it rain down on me
Come and make it rain down on me

Now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, Mack Daddy with a hoe up in the back seat
With the '97 pimp flow gotta feelin' when you smokin'
When I flip it to a track speed?

Talkin' about a beautiful figure astonishin' as Greek mythology
Body be just like a girl in uh, what's that movie?
Never mind, let me enter your atmosphere
As you enter my world and lemme touch that booty

I can't believe that your momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishin' soul, you need a modelin' role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin' from the bottom
To the top of that pole 'cause you can pop and control

Your fatty's so accurate when I'm smackin' it
It's makin' me say what I gotta do to get with that?
When it come to makin' it rain, I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin' the monkey, I can get it wet

You gone see me to ya baby, you need a better man
Here come the politics, I'ma be your weatherman
'Cause every time I'm lookin' up and I see more ass
I'ma constantly see rain in the forecast

This a way, that a way, I'm flickin' 5, 000 ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration, you the champion, here's the fetti confetti
Come on and get drunk with the money hauler

You done been good but you can do better
I done been wet but I can get wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
You done been good but you can do better
I done been wet but I can get wetter
Come and make it rain down on me

But when I'm not for the feminine
And everybody that perceive with the hatred
I'ma teach them a lesson, I take shots of adrenaline
'Cause that's the way I receive immunization against the recession

I got the muscle off my hustle and flow money
An entrepreneur with ways to get more money
So don't be trippin' when you a thot you see me throw money
Huh, it's just a little bit of show money

But if you want me to get it wet another ways
Then I'ma have to beat it up the first time I play with you girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play with your pearl

When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin' or fakin'
On me baby 'cause I know it takes the right touch
I ain't stoppin' 'til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin' 'til I see a lot of white stuff

Now you got me excited I can't hold it
I'm feelin' it comin' I'm 'bout to let off an explosion
Let it ride when I see you I'm makin' and shakin'
When I touch your body you catchin' convulsions

That's when I know I'm doin' what I'm supposed to
You chose me, I chose you
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you

You done been good but you can do better
I done been wet but I can get wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
You done been good but you can do better
I done been wet but I can get wetter
Come and make it rain down on me

I'm callin' ya daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy, daddy?
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy, daddy?
Come and make it rain down on me
Come and make it rain down on me
