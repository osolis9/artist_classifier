Shut-It-Down:Pitbull Featuring Akon:17:2010-02-20

Mr.305, I want everybody
To get down 'cause we about to shut down

Oh, can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky

Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down

Now watch me, now watch me
Now watch me shut this thang down

Suve, suve, hasta la nube
Balante ante, no mire patra

I hit the jackpot
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-ching
Real chicos do real things
On the road to the riches, get diamond rings

Moved up from the streets
Graduated hustla
On its way to an entrepreneur
Undefeated, done shooter

Now baby, save me
From the game before replacement
My life's a movie
Call me Martin Scorsese

I can care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch, now fuck, you pay me

Suve, suve, hasta la nube
Balante ante, no mire patra

Oh, can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky

Lose my money, honey
Now pay me what's you own me
Mom is a hurricane
You should see the way she blow me

I don't make it rain
I speak that global warming
This ain't no biggy, ready to that
Number 5, there is no warning

Now baby, save me
From the game before replacement
My life's a movie
Call me Martin Scorsese

I can care less if you love me or hate me
Life's a bitch, now fuck, you pay me

Suve, suve, hasta la nube
Balante ante, no mire patra

Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky
Oh, can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly

Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky

Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down

Now watch me, now watch me
Now watch me shut this thang down

It's my life, I'ma do what I do
And if you don't like it, it's cool, fuck you
