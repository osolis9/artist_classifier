Come-To-Me:Diddy feat Nicole Scherzinger:3:2007-01-20

Come to me, I can be what you need, ooh baby
It's Bad Boy bitch
(Do it do it do it do it, do it do it do it)
It feels good to be back
(Do it do it do it do it, do it do it do it)
I missed ya
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
You're now rollin' with the sounds of the BBE
(Just do it do it do it do it, do it do it do it)
You know what time it is
(Do it do it do it do it, do it do it do it)
Report to the dance floor
(It's Bad Boy)
Talk to 'em
See you out the corner of my eye
Leaninâ on the wall, lookin' fly
I want you to come be with me
Youâre the only one I wanna talk to
But I don't wanna rush
Iâm here, when will you make your move?
I see you eyein' me
I want cha, why don't cha come to me?
I can be what you need, ooh baby
Iâm standin', been waitin'
Iâm yearninâ, ooh Iâm burninâ
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me that you wanna know me
You know what it is Iâm back in the buildinâ
(You know what it is)
Security strapped still stackinâ a million
I stunt with the stallion, somethinâ Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
Iâm in it to win it, I'm willinâ to carry
The game, if you think Iâm not look at the carriage
Pop up clean up out of the Phantom
The people go screaminâ like an opera anthem
I did it before, Iâd do it again
I got it to blow, got it to spin
Flies before, cool as the wind
Got hits go back like juice 'n' gin, yeah
Shine the best and diamond necklaces
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know Iâm the shit, they wanna get next
Thatâs why she havinâ a fit âcause she wanted to get next to him
(Yeah, you know my name)
I'm here, when will you make your move?
(You know my motherfuckinâ name)
I see you eyein' me
I want cha, why don't cha come to me?
I can be what you need, ooh baby
Iâm standin', been waitin'
Iâm yearninâ, ooh Iâm burninâ
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me that you wanna know me
Anywhere I appear they all stop and stare
Admire your body language, speakinâ loud and clear like
I want you to come be with me
She be waitinâ, anticipatinâ for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me cominâ on like
I'm here, when will you make your move?
She digginâ my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the Boys absurd for sure
You canât fall âtil my aura call
I make miracles like I walked on water
What you want mama?
Order, itâs on my tab
Iâm so bad with the cash I dropped a whole bag
Where you at girl?
I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you eyein' me
I want cha, why don't cha come to me?
I can be what you need, ooh baby
Iâm standin', been waitin'
Iâm yearninâ, ooh Iâm burninâ
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me that you wanna know me
I'm here right now canât wait no more, no
You were the one who stole my heart
Canât you see the wait is over?
(I knew it)
I need you to come closer
(From the very start)
This feeling is getting strong
(Oh lord)
You really got me hot
I see you eyein' me
I want cha, why don't cha come to me?
I can be what you need, ooh baby
Iâm standin', been waitin'
Iâm yearninâ, ooh Iâm burninâ
Get to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me
Itâs Bad Boy bitch
(Do it do it do it)
I remember the first day our eyes met
You almost made me make it bust on itself, shit
I never seen anything like it
I always swore I wouldnât fall in love, I'd never fall in love
I thought it could never happen to a nigga like me
I think Iâm fallinâ in love
But then there came you, but then there came you
Ayyo, Jusâ turn me up
(Yo yo, itâs been a long time)
Yeah, turn me up a little bit more
I wanna make sure they can feel me
Yeah
(Turn me up just a little bit more)
Like that
