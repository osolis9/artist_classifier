This is, this is, this is
Cook! Cool n Dre!
Ain't nobody seeing this right here, we see nobody

I know you came to party so, get up on yo feet
Yeah baby, just trip that body and sing along wit me, come on
I know you've been searchin' for someone who satisfies you
And gives you so much more

Caution when my lip just twitch to one side
We don't bitch, we don't snitch, we thick, and just ride
And I, never gave a fuck about Popo
Niggaz so gangsta, making songs bout my 4, 4

My, my, my fo, fo, fo, fo, fo, fo
It gets worse, kick my shit when I visit the church
I'm down wit TD Jakes and Kirk Franklin
Better have my offerin' plate filled wit' Franklins

Blasphemy, I got niggaz that'll blast for me
Ribs touchin' and they askin' me, Crack! Nigga!
Show me where the safe bet, I'll lay 'em down with the mac
Leave 'em face flat, listen

You don't wanna start no drama
We don't scrap when there's problems we just clap and revolve 'em
And get it coke, let it go, head it mo', sippin' mo
Didn't know? Better know now

I know you came to party so, get up on yo feet
Yeah baby, just trip that body and sing along wit me, come on
I know you've been searchin' for someone who satisfies you
And gives you so much more

Puff and pass in the Hilton suite
Crush and pass, is the sick, tape me
I'll probably when I, ask her didn't know the dick ten feet
You'll need a ladder just to sit on me

In the race screamin' Viva Tito
Wit' Don 'kee Maddison Square, Arena people
I pull Mammi to the side, she feel me
Yellin' punta a gasolina

Now how many bricks does it take to marble out a 36 room estate
Follow me, I'm from Philly where they eat cheese steaks in a red belly
All a bitch V8, it's Joe cr-eal, for-real
And even warn the kids in school on coke deals, Crack!
And that's the seltzer you should know how the shit gon' go
Follow me, come on

I know you came to party so, get up on yo feet
Yeah baby, just trip that body and sing along wit me, come on
I know you've been searchin' for someone who satisfies you
And gives you so much more

Hold up, wait a minute
[Incomprehensible]

And we don't see nobody
Make your hair stand up like you're 'Growin Up Gotti'
Hit lyrics every time we come out, nigga
Use a fist 'fo' it come out ya mouth

The way I'm stackin' white these days
Looking like a chick that go wit Flava Flav
And I'm so so real, niggaz wanna kill the Don
Front of my house, probably wit my son in my arms

But I drop 'em like its hot
Pass 'em the glock, my little shorty's a chip off the old block
Go against Coke, let 'em and show
I give you 10 ways to kill off the whole block

I know you came to party so, get up on yo feet
Yeah baby, just trip that body and sing along wit me, come on
I know you've been searchin' for someone who satisfies you
And gives you so much more
