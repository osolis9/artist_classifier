NAStradamus:Nas:4:2000-03-04

Two thousand G, yo, I need an encore y'all
You should welcome me back
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef, I could let a slug melt in your hat

'Cuz I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Century twenty-one solar eclipse
While you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc
The Lonius, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet

AK is my heat, everyday in the street till I lay six feet
QB, PJ's, and we playin' for keeps, jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here

The best years, wearin' a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus

I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
The Nastrodamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit

Black ski masks up in the projects, camouflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels

Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail
Slingin' for chips, the fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit

A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill, leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech

Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus

Now, lounge homeboy, you in the godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
We gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man

But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name
You a legend and they don't understand
How you see over from heaven, but that's another level, brethren

Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac Eleven's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right, but that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless

Laptops with a hundred gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm

Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar, now he is Nastradamus

Ill Will, Nastrodamus
New LP for the 2G
Bravehearts nation
Big things

Lucciano
Oh, the Lord again
M O B B deep
Zaire, jungle, raise hope

We are trapped in a millennial war between God and His angels
And men totally energized by the devil and the power of demons
