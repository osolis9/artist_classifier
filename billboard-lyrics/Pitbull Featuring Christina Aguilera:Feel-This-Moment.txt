Feel-This-Moment:Pitbull Featuring Christina Aguilera:3:2013-09-14

Ask for money and get it viced
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the Dirty, but that chico nice
Ya'll call it a moment, I call it life

One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Oh, I just wanna feel this moment

Mr Worldwide, Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita, come on, dale, que la cosa esta rica (I wanna feel this moment)
Feel this moment

Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from the hard ways, Bill sos, and oh yeas
They count it always, 305 all day
Now baby, we can party, oh baby, we can party

She read books, especially about red rooms and tight ups
I got it hooked, 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red ta-ta up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya, but time is money
Only difference is I own it, now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Feel this moment

I see the future but live for the moment, make sense, don't it?
Now make dollars, I mean billions, I'm a genius, I mean brilliant
This street is what scoot em and made em slicker, to slick with the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot, but I'm still undefeated like shula

I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with alll my peeps
Baby, we can travel the world and not given view, and all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stop watch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment

One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Oh, I just wanna feel this moment

Come one, feel this moment

Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
