Jam On It"(feat. Cardan
Coola lover make you bounce to this
L-A make you bounce to this
Everybody we gonna bounce to this
Gonna rock to this

[Verse 1: Cardan]

Yo, yo it's a Harlem World thing
So grab something
Asks for dimes and up, if not have sumthin'
But come shake them hips like waiters take them tips
And bring half of the world I got plenty of space to fit
Except for me I makes you boogie
Boogie to the beat
Once beat bang boogie, I gotta party in the street
No Bacardi with heat, but a party full of peace
Jammin till I feel it in the bottom of my feet
Now dance if you gotta
Shake your pants if you gotta
Scream Cardan out in France if you gotta
Shake with me
Motivate, sweatigate, feel straight
Wake up in the morning at eight
I tell my baby girl, it's a whirl
I came here to party
Tell her friend, I'm a tell mine and we gone start it
J-D know all our hoes come to our doors
And the dance floor get to jam some more

[Hook:]
Jam on it, jam on it
If you got what it takes just flaunt it
All my ladies in the house you want it
And all my fellas in the house get on it 
[Repeat]

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]

Never see me in a watch without the rocks and the bezzle
And the band on the level
Niggas can't understand I'm the one you watch in the club all all night
On the top hoes love and call all night
It's the C-H-I-CHIO yo
With the drop with the pedal to the floor
Hoes come to me and get dressed, what they lookin for?
Lookin fly and I'm a die gettin mo doe
Niggas know I don't talk, I show in a flash
And don't exagerate cash in my heavyweight class
Get the ass y'all dream about
Hear niggas sing about
I ain't ever seen without
The dance floors packed and burnin up
Puttin cats on they back as I turn it up
Now tell me what yall wanna do
Get down and get ran through
That's how this little man do

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cardan]

Now, now, now for my ladies keep dancin
Fellas keep boppin
Shake what your mama gave and it don't stop wit it
Move side to side it wit it
Rock wit it
So much space you fit the whole block in it
So get on down, get on down 
Now Harlem World it's on now, it's on now
Jam with me till you fill it in your middle back bone
If you fifteen to fifty you aint gotta act drone
One thing you got to give em (ass)
A little bit of rhythym  (right)
Make em move from side to side then spin em (no lies)
I get em from the side or the middle
As long as I can turn sunshine into a drizzle
Cardan, so when I close
I say amen to the god that brought me here
Made the world so fear
Oh yeah, I'm bout to rock for this whole year
In this big city of rap, unless it's Joe Clear

[Hook 2X]
