If-U-Stay-Ready:Suga Free:9:1997-08-23

Yes, ha ha
Suga Free and DJ Quik

Hey babe, I know you're fine but ha, open mine up
I got some game in the cut, yo, open mine up
Holy mackerdime, I'm tryin' to rock wit' you both
I'm at the same damn time, y'all
Now when you be hatin', you be gigglin' to pimps when you be fiddlin'
Listenin', fiddlin', that nigga's straight with that pimpin'
You don't gotta go home

No, but you gotta get the hell up outta here
So holy smokes and gee whiz
If game recognize game, don't check me, go check the trick
I know she just had a baby in June, her chest is saggin'
Her na na had turned to jelly and her stomach looked like a moon
But see I humped in the front, I humped it in the back
Then I stopped when she got in the middle of her climax, goin'

If u stay ready
You ain't got to get ready
If u stay ready
You don't ever ever have to get
Someone way out to get ready

If I could get a dollar for every time you look at me sideways
I'd pay the West side on Friday
To beat all player haters, y'all on my way
Don't trip on me, potna, no uhh uhh
I'm havin' visions of Bloody Mary
With AIDS tryin' to give some na na

You can't dictate mine
What I look like to you, baby? Besides your feelin' is fine
All natural like yo brain, engineered like no other
Fly for life, still like a mannequin when it comes to my mother
Capricorn, baby and I'm stubborn just like you
So why don't you do me a favor and tell that lie to that fool?

Don't get me twisted, baby, I love you too
But when that redneck Carlo come with love don't do
Baby, my money's on the clock, right around the block
You see me stack big knot, my music's all I got
So I'ma stay ready, so I don't gotta get ready
'Cause I rolls like King Tut resurrected like I'm a deist

If u stay ready
You ain't got to get ready
If u stay ready
You don't ever ever have to get
Someone way out to get ready

She says, "Suga Free, you got some money?"
I said, "Yeah, since when?"
She said, "What that mean?"
I look at her dead between her eyes
I said, "You ain't gonna get it"

Wait, now be still for me
Why not just make you independent
And you can wear them cameras down to the
And get my scrilla for me

The life and times in the city of Gz
You live the all-beef patty
Special sauce, lettuce, cheese
5'8", 36-24-36, AKA, Yum Yum
Full-time hustler, a player's trick

But I, I spit this game so swell
No, put your clothes back on, baby
I'm into breakin' hearts, promises and fingernails
That was no lie and I put that on the
Holy Ghost and four more Gods

You broke my heart and I let you succeed
'Cause to a player that's a organ that you really don't need
Low and behold, what good is havin'
A heart if it could break and b-b-broke?
So if u stay ready, what you gonna have to get ready for?

If u stay ready
You ain't got to get ready
If u stay ready
You don't ever ever have to get
Someone way out to get ready

If u stay ready
You ain't got to get ready
If u stay ready
You don't ever ever have to get
Someone way out to get ready

If u stay ready
You ain't got to get ready
If u stay ready
You don't ever ever have to get
Someone way out to get ready

One time, you know?
One time, no no, say what you do
Make your money and what you say
Holla ya ready, I'm Suga Free
Get my a money, oh baby oh
What you wanna do to me?
Goddamn, Suga Free
[Incomprehensible], DJ Quik and I stay for life

Aight y'all
'Cause if u stay ready
You don't have to get ready
