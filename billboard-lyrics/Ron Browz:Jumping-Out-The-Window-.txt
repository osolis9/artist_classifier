Ohh...
Ohh...
Ether boy...

I'm jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window
Window...
Window...

Ayo ya ain't gotta worry
Harlem world man I got this
Hit the studio spit nothing but the hotness
Hit the club up and your girl is on my list
Got the goons with me so ya don't wanna try this
V.I.P. and everybody ballin'
Having fun and nobody is brawling
Shawty come here I don't know why you stallin'
We gone party 'til it's the morning
The morning...
The morning...

I'm jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window
Window...
Window...

I don't wanna yell so mami come closer
I'mma take you home outside I got the Rover
See it in your eyes you mad when I hold her
Hate in your blood you must be bipolar
I ain't never seen nobody like that
She gave me a kiss and said she'll be back
My leather is clean my Gucci's all black
None of ya dudes in here is no match
No Match...
No Match...

I'm jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window
Window...
Window...

Throwing money on shawty when she move her hips
Get your passport ma we about to take trip
You can shop when you land all luggage in the whip
Definition of sexy gloss on the lips
She know I'm the hottest in America
She know I'm the hottest in America
She know I'm the hottest in America
She know I'm the hottest in America
America...
America...
She know I'm the hottest in America

I'm jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window with this one
Jumping out the window
Window...
