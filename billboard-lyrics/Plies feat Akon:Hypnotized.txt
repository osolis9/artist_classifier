Hypnotized:Plies feat Akon:3:2008-02-23

You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumpin'
Titties just bouncin' up and down
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round

That booty keep bumpin'
Titties just bouncin' up and down
It's two o'clock in the mornin'
I'm yiked up and I'm horny
All I need now is some moanin'

That pussy got me zonin'

Her vibe tell me she want it
She gotta fuck as she on me
I got her now 'cause she's jonin'
I know in the panty she foamin'
I'm locked eyes on that monkey
I know she wet 'cause she told me
That ass on her, she pokin'
Every nigga in here scopin'
I see me up in her pokin'
She bent over and I'm strokin'
Her cheeks spread wide open
I'm beatin' it and I'm focused
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round

That booty keep bumpin'
Titties just bouncin' up and down

You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumpin'

Titties just bouncin' up and down
(Now do it some more)
Just like that

(Just do it some more)
Yes, just like that

(Girl, do it some more)
Now shake that ass
And make a nigga like me spend that cash
(Now do it some more)

Girl, just like that
(Just do it some more)
Yes, just like that
(Girl, do it some more)
Now shake that ass
And make a nigga like me spend that cash
She bad as hell and she swoll
I'm tryna play in her hole
Lil' mama a dime, she cold
I fuck her once and she sold
I want her naked, no clothes

I'm in the private shows
No limit, anything goes
I'ma let her ride me, her toes
Just stand in front of me and pose
You touch mine, I touch yours

To get her sprung is my goal
First time I seen her, I froze
I had to get her, she knows
She buck'd it then she fold
'Cause I'm too real and she knows
She wanted a goon and it show

You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumpin'
Titties just bouncin' up and down
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round

That booty keep bumpin'
Titties just bouncin' up and down
(Now do it some more)
Just like that
(Just do it some more)
Yes, just like that
(Girl, do it some more)
Now shake that ass
And make a nigga like me spend that cash
(Now do it some more)
Girl, just like that
(Just do it some more)
Yes, just like that
(Girl, do it some more)
Now shake that ass
And make a nigga like me spend that cash
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumpin'
Titties just bouncin' up and down
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
That booty keep bumpin'
Titties just bouncin' up and down
You got me so hypnotized
The way your body rollin' round and round
