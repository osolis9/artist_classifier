I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying, but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away
Yeah, strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away

They got their guns out, aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me
Me against them

Me against enemies
Me against friends
Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood

They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising
I'm just summising

I win, thrive
Soar
Higher, higher, higher
More fire

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating everytime it locks me in
Painting they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins

'Cause I am not a word
I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined

I am not fly
I am levitation
I represent an entire generation

I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare

Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nay's become yea's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

I came to win

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly
