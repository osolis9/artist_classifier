Make-A-Movie:Twista feat Chris Brown:6:2011-04-16

The perfect storm is Twista and Chris Brown ya dig
I got a new one for ya
Lets make a movie baby

Twista got cars
Big swagger
I'm a rock star like Mick Jagger
And I got bars that I spit faster
You a hot star no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride
On a journey with the one that you call daddy
Who gon make you get it wet
But this time we gon do something romantic and different
I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set

I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape
Plus I think yo face cute when its a HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me
When I pull my h2 up to your h3
You know that you want to be in this movie
So dont be acting like a trippin with a stranger mission
Recording you while you lovin me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me
Filming me licking until you say cut
Ready for any footage you wanna get
Ain't gotta call nobody else because
I do my own stunts
Its the X rated version of a box office hit
I see you ready to strip for this

So let me get the music in, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh ohhh)
Baby we dont need no script for this
I'ma throw a couple thousand baby strip for this
Let me pull my camera and make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yehhh
Baby we dont need no actresses
Let me tell you what I'm working with, I'ma break your back with this
Let me pull my camera out lets make a movie yehhh
Starring you and me yehhh yehhh, girl

Shawty we gon make a movie
Got me lovin it when I'm feelin on the booty
Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol
Coz it do some thing to me
She look better than any chick in my perimeter
Sexy, I wish I could film every bit of her
Kiss her neck down to her stomach and then I'ma
Tell her we could be in a personal cinema

I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then
Cuz I wanna see how its coming out and goin in
Let you see such a freak in me, I hope this never leak on TMZ this is 50 world star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis
Im yo director, filming you for practice
And you know I think you a hell of a actress
Especially when I'm shooting you on a matress
Shawty straight to the top thats where we headed
And I'ma see my name in the credits
And be the shit if you let it
See somethin that you not really feelin
Then we can always go back and make an edit
I'll be sippin on patron platinum
She knew about the rapping
But didn't know I'd be on acting
Now a personal reality show
So then, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh ohhh)

Baby we dont need no script for this
I'ma throw a couple thousand baby strip for this
Let me pull my camera and make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah
Baby we dont need no actresses
Let me tell you what I'm working with, I'ma break your back with this
Let me pull my camera out lets make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah yeah
Girl.
