Intro:)

Oooh... can I run away with you
I wanna get lost in love... baby
To all those pretty girls (pretty girls)
This one's for you (this one's for you)

Check this out...

(chorus)
Something about you baby (something about you) drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl (something about you girl) blows my mind (blows my mind baby)
Something about you baby (eres todo) drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl blows my mind (come on come on)

Si tu supieras lo que siento
Cada vez que me pongo a pensar en todos los momentos
All the good times we had me and you, you and I
Hot summer nights makin love in July
The only girl that didn't give it on the first night
Una mujer incomparable I'm in love for life
Me cautivaste with your ways and all the things you do
My pretty girl I gotta make it work with you
Tell the world tell your girls and your family
Con este anillo te prometo you're my everything
Cuz nobody's ever made me feel the way you do
I just dropped you off already miss you
Chica bonita sonrisa sincera
I wanna be with you hasta que me muera (forever)
Let's make a pact and always be together (always, always)
With you by my side girl I'm down for whatever

(chorus)
Something about you baby (something about you) drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl blows my mind (blows my mind)
Something about you baby drives me crazy
(I usually don't believe in love at first sight, but this girl had it all)
Something about this pretty girl blows my mind

You stood out from the group from across the room
I had to keep my attention on you (hello)
Somethin about that pretty face that pretty smile
You couldn't help but to get lost in those pretty eyes
Yea this girl she had it all (yea)
The type of woman that you take to mother
Sayin "Look what I found, love and companionship"
Someone to talk through these rough times (yea) who ain't afraid to handle it (you know)
And understands that my life is different
And accepts it, this isn't what I expected
Yea she's beautiful, inside and out
Something hard to find in the world these days (in the world today)
Even on my worst day (laughs)
She's got me happy like a kid wakin' up on his birthday
This love was different it was based on friendship
I'm lettin you know (come on) I'm ready to ride out (with you)

(chorus)
Something about you baby (something about you) drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl (you're so beautiful to me) blows my mind (blows my mind)
Something about you baby drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl blows my mind

What's up lil' shorty can we talk for a minute
I've been havin dreams and you bein all up in 'em
I know you don't know me I seen you around
You're the hottest lookin' honey that I've seen in this town
Come on, lets conversate take a walk get together
Just wanna know you a lil' bit better
Beauty uncomparable, eyes drove me crazy
She that type I wanna have for my lady
Something about you don't know what it is
I know we just met but can I give you a kiss?
Grabbed her hand and she hugged me actin kinda shy
Dimples on your face got you lookin' pretty fly
Baby this is real talk I wanna be with you
Little did I know you were diggin' me too
Now I'm down on my knees, got you sayin' "I do"
So I had to write a song dedicated to you (to you to you)

(chorus)
Something about you baby (something about you) drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl blows my mind (blows my mind)
Something about you baby drives me crazy
Something about this pretty girl blows my mind

(Music fades)
