I need everybody to report to tha dance floor right now.
Tha world is very different now, you know why ITS GUCCI TIME

Big Gucci
Trap boys call me Brick Gucci
Dime piece time piece got my Swiss movin
Swiss cheese out a hata if he act foolish
Swizz Beats Gucci Mane call it trap music
I think I need a ESPY the rappers best respect me
They try to ron Artest me the gone have to arrest me
With a doubt I bring em out
The kid is all she think about
She cheated wit la flare but he didn't spill a drink about her
Do you know what time it is
Gucci time
15 for every diamond bitch
I'm hood rich wealthy and all that there
? Have no Idea

Its gucci time cut lights on
Cut the cut the lights on
All this ice on no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on its gucci time [X4]

Came in drankin rollin up stankin white boy wasted frat house wasted
Amazin like my bracelet I'm flossin r.i.p the mike the ice got my chest moon walkin
Cabbage patchin bouncin like bankin head
Pull up in the drop top ferrari on bank head
Colder than a polar bear sleepin in the freezer
She wish she never met me wanna catch amnesia
Gucci mane crazy I mite pull up on a zebra
Land on top a eagle smoke a joint of zebra
Standin on the sofa spillin liquor on the speaker
Call the paralegal cuz this shit should be illegal

Its gucci time cut lights on
Cut the cut the lights on
All this ice on no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on its gucci time [X4]

Keep tockin a tockin to keep tickin
Ya rolie ain't rell if the bitch keep tickin
A hundred thou on the shoe and socks ain't nothin
A hundred thou on the wristband aint nuthin [X2]

Its gucci time cut lights on
Cut the cut the lights on
All this ice on no need to cut the lights on
Cut the lights on its gucci time [X4]
