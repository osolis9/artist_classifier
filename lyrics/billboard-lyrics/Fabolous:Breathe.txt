Breathe:Fabolous:2:2004-11-20

Breathe, oh
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!

Breathe
One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe, oh

One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe
Then you gotta
Then you gotta

Sure these niggaz can't breathe
When I come through, hum too, some shoes
Gotta be 20 man, it's not even funny they can't breathe
The choke holds too tight, the left looks too right
You know what? You right, these bitches can't breathe

Look look, they hearts racin', they start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past that they can't breathe
In the presence of the man, your future looks better than ya past
If you present with the man
You betta breathe

You niggaz can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm gettin' better year by year
Like they say wine do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through

And I pace myself
I know these money hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep em' on a diet
Embrace they health or either keep em' on a quiet
And space myself and just take a deep breath

I got em' grabbin' they chest
'Coz it's hurtin' 'em to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They rather see me lay in a Hearse than lay in the bach
And I ain't just layin' a verse, I'm sayin' the facts

I came back with some sicka stones
That got these broke niggaz lookin' at me
Like they chokin' on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone, can't leave the dick alone
So I know it's one of them everytime I flip my phone

Breathe
One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe

One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe

One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe
Then you gotta
Then you gotta

Yo, these niggaz can't breathe
When I come through, hum too, some shoes
Gotta be 20 man, it's not even funny they can't breathe
The choke holds too tight, the left looks too right
You know what? You right, these bitches can't breathe

Look look, they hearts racin', they start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past that they can't breathe
In the presence of the man, your future looks better than ya past
If you present with the man
You betta breathe

I see 'em on the block when I passes
Lookin' like they need oxygen masks
I make it hard to breathe
But I keep the glocks in the stashes
'Coz the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to breathe

They has to react like havin' a asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezin' behind me
My flow is like a Coupe, breezin' at 90
That's the reason they signed me

It's slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and under estimators
And ride up on them like they escalators

They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue
And then

Breathe
One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe

One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe

One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe
Then you gotta
Then you gotta

Yo, these niggaz can't breathe
When the crew walk in it, pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, 'fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef, only way you catch a F

To the A-B, it's in the maybe, rollin' with my baby
Grippin' on a toy that you won't find in 'KayBee'
I rhyme slick on ya
They don't have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know about lettin' dimes lick on ya?

While you inhale the weed
And it won't stop till they inhale ya seed
And it don't stop till I tell 'em to breathe
Like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fuckin' hope
Unless these motherfuckas breathe

Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta, The Bronx gotta
Queens gotta, Staten Isle gotta
You niggaz gotta, you bitches gotta
Everybody breathe

One and then a two, two
Two and then a three, three
Three and then a four, four
Then you gotta breathe
Then you gotta
Then you gotta

Breathe
