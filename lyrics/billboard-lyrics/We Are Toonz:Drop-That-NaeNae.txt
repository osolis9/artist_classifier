What like this? Alright
Yo, okay, alright, I got it huh?

Crank that Nae Nae, drop that Nae Nae
Work that Nae Nae, that's a Nae Nae ay
Nae Nae HUAHHHH! Nae Nae that's the new thing poppin
Got your girl over here in the corner and she jockin
All you gotta do is put your hands up and walk
Don't be scared lil' momma Toonz got you

Now this here funky, who was the man with the plan
My boys up on that
Nae Nae what we called it while
Y'all guys out here stallin
While we ridin by, claims she really be diggin me
Lovin my style she feelin me
She like the way I jig on a beat
Jig on a beat

That's that smooth Doo Doo Brown, got my hand up in the air
And I rock it side to side, man my dance is everywhere
107.9 got our name all on the air
Yeah this Nae Nae takin over so y'all better be prepared

Ladies say this shit with me (Nae Nae) turned up on the beat (yo)
You ain't gotta dance we call it jiggin on the beat (hold up hold up)

Hands UP! And a touch up in they face cause you don't care now one time
