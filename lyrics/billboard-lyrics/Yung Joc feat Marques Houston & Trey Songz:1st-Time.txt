1st-Time:Yung Joc feat Marques Houston & Trey Songz:11:2007-04-14

There ain't nobody else to talk about
Hey love, you remember your first time?
Get dat with a real nigga? Heh, heh, heh
Well, let's talk about it

It ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you her and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty best beware

There ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty you best beware

Ah, hold on this ain't no love song, mo' like a cut song
You say your day was long, well, tell daddy what's wrong
I'ma tell ya one time just relax and unwind
Whisper sweet nothings now you're blushin' chills down your spine

Oh yeah, you hot and tempted, oh no, not pretty Rickie
But when you 'Grind on Me', I'ma leave you hot and trippin'
Just slip in them satin sheets now go on and roll over
Oh yeah, it's up and down motions like a roller coaster

I see you up on top, you all on my 'Joc'
I'ma do it non-stop until yo' cherry pop
I'ma keep goin' and goin', the Energizer Bunny
Mister Long John all in your tummy

It ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you her and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty best beware

There ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty you best beware

Won't ya let me duce ya to thug Kama Sutra?
This ain't no lovey dovey but watch how I seduce ya
Girl I'm the man, I-I-I'm the man
I push the right buttons and there's sex on demand

Oh yeah, I like it slow baby, be easy
Ooh, watch your teeth baby, be easy
Tell me yo' Vicky Secrets, tell me all the dirt
You smell like peaches, must be Bath and Body Works

Love the way yo' body work, I'ma make yo' body rock
Once you climax, you feel the aftershock

I know I got'cha hooked on this lovin'
Don't get it twisted, ccuttin', baby

It ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you her and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty best beware

There ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty you best beware

Yeah, I know, I know, I still ain't went soft
But I gotta go let's hit the shower baby, it's time to rinse off
I'll wash yours, you wash mine, I'll adore it the first time
I blew yours, you blew mine, sometimes I'll drop you a line

But look, don't tell nobody just keep it on the low
Not yo' best friend, not yo' cousin, nobody's gotta know
I know it sounds crazy but that's just how it is
Yung J O C, long live, long live

It ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you her and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty best beware

There ain't nothin' like the first time
I'm tryin' to tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love shorty you best beware

Mmm hmm, yeah I know y'all wasn't expectin' that
Welcome to 'New Joc City'
Goodnight
