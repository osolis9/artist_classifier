Sexy-Lady:Yung Berg feat Junior:6:2007-10-13

Yeah, YB's, I swear this album is crazy

Get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back
Go get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back
Hey, get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back
Get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back, come on!

Hey, sexy lady, it was nice to know you
But I got to move on, on
Hey, sexy lady, it was nice to know you
But I got to move on, on
Hey, sexy lady

Oh, and damn right, baby girl's a diva
But every time she out wit me, she be blowin' ***
In the coupe lookin' better than the Mona Lisa
Tunin' into my songs thinkin' 'bout features

She know her lil' *** spit ether
And them grown dudes really don't know how to treat her
So she rock wit me and I roll wit her
'Cause I'm a D-boy and she's a go-getter

This new girl that I'm poofin' on
Gotta young boy thinkin' 'bout movin' on
She got her Louis Vuitton bag and the shoes on
Wanna take her to the [Incomprehensible]

See a *** need more than one
I park the Rolls outside like Rep and Ron
And rolled up the ***, yeah, full of bubble gum
Yung Berg is out here, yeah, we got another one

Hey, sexy lady, it was nice to know you
But I got to move on, on
Hey, sexy lady, it was nice to know you
But I got to move on, on
Hey, sexy lady

Yeah and damn right, baby girl da ***
She love it when I throw it deep like Micheal Vick
I love it 'cause she know the younguns don't bite or lick
She know the kid hit the lap dog and write a hit

Uh and ain't no denyin' it, nope
She want it, she can have it, why? 'Cause I'm buyin' it
Da boss, boy, gotta roll wit the fliest ***
And she da truth if I'm lyin' then I'm dyin', man

This other chick that I'm divin' in
She a good look that's why we always dinin' in
Chea, in L.A. we at Katana
Or in Chi-town we straight to Benihana's

And how she do it man? She did it proper
Three hours and we both kept on our Pradas
I had my loafers, she was in dem heels
Berg in the YB's real big heels

Hey, sexy lady, it was nice to know you
But I got to move on, on
Hey, sexy lady, it was nice to know you
But I got to move on, on
Hey, sexy lady

Get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back
Go, get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back
Hey, get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back
Get ya lean on, shawty, bring it back, come on!
