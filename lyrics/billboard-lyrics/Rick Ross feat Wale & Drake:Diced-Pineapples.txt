Diced-Pineapples:Rick Ross feat Wale & Drake:14:2013-01-12

Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky wont catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but
I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya
I'm tryna see how deep you are
And believe me shawty I ain't talking about

no intimate conversation
I'm wanna see if I can make you reach things unattainable when I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals
Will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna give you whats better than better
The better my effort
the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or

Temporary forever's
Shawty get it together
Diced Pineapple
May your love come down some of mine might have you
You design my imagination
And let me redefine foreplay so you need five
Tell me shawty you got it baby

If it's not it baby
Hope its progress baby

Let it all drip baby

Stop that shaking
No more talking baby
No more talking baby
Shawty so fine
Pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples
there my baby taste the best
I nearly lost my mind
Guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex'
Paid it off cash
so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib

I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I like to make her toes curl as I'm licking on her flesh
Sex all night
couple shots of ciroc
Crib on the water, got Lebron up the block
Money ain't a thing baby
welcome to the mark
Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing her
You know form is? when you on the team
Double-M G them other niggas fell off
Baby girl I just wanna see you well off
Call me crazy, shit at least you calling

Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad and you take it all back

Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Shawty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set

I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile
And she do it with the sex

Pop bottles, make love, thug passion

Red Bottoms Montclair, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles gold plated

Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas

French Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip

I'ma trip, go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

Call me crazy shit at least you calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Yo it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad and you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Aww yeah
Something about her probably cant live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rescue me the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you

And you eager to work perfect, I can't employ you

Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent provocateur

Rushing you out your draws
Though patiently get you off
Hate when they get too anxious though
Hate when they be too?
Like too get too deep
But I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you
Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk
I like to make it sing a tune
All we need it weed
We don't need no room
Right now I'm trying
We don't need a spoon
Call me crazy, shit at least you calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad and you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right
