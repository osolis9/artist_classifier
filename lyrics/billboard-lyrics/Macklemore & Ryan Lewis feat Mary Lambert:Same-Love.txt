Same-Love:Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat Mary Lambert:2:2013-10-26

When I was in the third grade
I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face

She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before pre-k."
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head

I remember doing the math like "Yeah, I'm good at little league."
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those who liked the same sex had the characteristics

The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, praying God

Ahh nah, here we go
America the brave
Still fears what we don't know

And God loves all His children is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty five hundred years ago
I don't know

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted too
And I can't change

Even if I tried
Even if I wanted too
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
If I was gay
I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately
"Man, that's gay"

Gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color
Complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
Human rights for everybody
There is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service
Those words aren't anointed
And that holy water that you soak in is then poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless

Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same
But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted too
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted too

My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause
Progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful someone would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us

We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted too
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted too
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient, love is kind (not cryin' on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient, love is kind.
