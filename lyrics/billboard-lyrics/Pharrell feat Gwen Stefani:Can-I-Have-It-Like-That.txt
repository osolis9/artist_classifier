Can-I-Have-It-Like-That:Pharrell feat Gwen Stefani:20:2005-12-17

Ladies and gentlemen
Yes sir
Let's do it
Yes sir

Yo, on and on and my nuts I'm palming
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain heart is a charmin'
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado

Shit, pop ya bottles toast and scream, “Cheers!”
Getcha two step ‘cuz it's the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, 2 for a Pair
Officially announcing this is warfare

‘Cuz back in the day my clouds was grey
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin ass jets
But now

Man, my business so clear out the window of the Lear
And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now
Hello, can you hear me now?

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop ya purse and grab ya hips
And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

On and on and this beat is zoning
I control they mind from straight over the phone and
Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist
And never get addicted unless the heady wop is serious

From Louisville to Jimmy Choos, he's real
She knows the time she sees the Richard Mille
Flat double skeletal Tourbillion
It's just like her body move, it turns her on

She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See I can do it thisaway, I can do it thataway
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway

So cool it like New Edition unless you hot as you say
I'll get it, ok, let it boil away
But please run along, ‘cuz ladies is feelin' wrong
And I got some right for 'em right after this song
My name is Skateboard P

Ladies and gentlemen

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop ya purse and grab ya hips
And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

On and on and the temperature's warming
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit

Should I mention the fact the transition is the track?
New incision to the vision just to get me where I'm at
Lil' Skateboard he too grown
Riding up and down Collins in that new two-tone

It's so cold you don't wanna feel the chill of it
(Uh!)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it
(Uh!)
I don't smoke but I bet the sensamill of it
It totally intensifies the vivid ass appeal of it

You can be jealous and grit ya teeth
But all these little niggas got something in reach
So, you want heat? These niggas can front heat
While on my boat party trying to sunseek
My name is Skateboard P

Ladies and gentlemen

Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that

So, drop ya purse and grab ya hips
And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that?
You got it like that
Can I have it like that?
You got it like that
