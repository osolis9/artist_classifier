Awnaw:Nappy Roots:15:2002-06-22

Yo, ha ha Nappy Roots<br />
Awnaw<br />
<br />
Awnaw, hell naw, boy<br />
Man, y'all done up and done it<br />
Awnaw, hell naw, boy<br />
Y'all done up and done it<br />
<br />
Awnaw, hell naw, boy<br />
Man, y'all done up and done it<br />
Ah, y'all done up and done it<br />
Man, y'all done up and done it<br />
<br />
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook<br />
You hear me flippin' through my pages out my favorite notebook<br />
The microphone was in the closet, what? No headphones, we lost it<br />
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin' over the faucets<br />
<br />
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin' to make beats<br />
E-Dubz was being a hustler, hey man<br />
Always flirtin' with all his customers and flat broke<br />
Nappy smokin' blacks out on the back porch<br />
I'm thinkin' I got everything a country boy could ask for<br />
<br />
Now, what we do to get here? Say dat boy<br />
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw, say dat boy<br />
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for<br />
Hated for the cussin' but the hatred, it made us cuss more<br />
<br />
Held on but it was hard, stepped up, took charge<br />
Ran through what we scared of but what was we afraid for?<br />
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us<br />
Being here is alright but must believe we want more<br />
<br />
Them country boys on the rise<br />
With them big fat wheels on the side<br />
Peep them vertical grills on the ride<br />
And aww<br />
<br />
Them country boys<br />
  (Awnaw, hell naw, man, y'all done up and done it)<br />
With them big fat wheels<br />
  (Awnaw, hell naw, boy, y'all done up and done it)<br />
<br />
Peep the vertical grills<br />
  (Awnaw, hell naw, boy, man, y'all done up and done it)<br />
And aww<br />
  (Y'all done up and done it, man, y'all done up and done it)<br />
<br />
My yegga, we hogwild, bet that from that buddha to that toota-file<br />
Hell naw, them country boys ain't headed south for six miles<br />
Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred-spokes<br />
Skullied on that front po'ch, plus you know they got 'dro<br />
<br />
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill<br />
Interstate 65 headed down that Cashville<br />
Glass filled to the tippy-top, back-seat Benz<br />
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints<br />
<br />
A damn shame, gotta grind anythang and everythang<br />
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane<br />
A long time, a gravel road to cash and fame and sold my soul<br />
To Hell and back and back and forth with same jeans and nappy 'fro<br />
<br />
I might, hop off the Harley, smoke mine like Bob Marley<br />
Block parties with shawties, wallin' like they swallowin' Bacardi<br />
Them butter skin, Prophit gutter like kin<br />
Understand you 'bout to lose ya life fuckin' with them<br />
<br />
Them country boys on the rise<br />
With them big fat wheels on the side<br />
Peep the vertical grills on the ride<br />
And aww<br />
<br />
Them country boys<br />
  (Awnaw, hell naw, man, y'all done up and done it)<br />
With them big fat wheels<br />
  (Awnaw, hell naw, boy, y'all done up and done it)<br />
<br />
Peep the vertical grills<br />
  (Awnaw, hell naw, boy, man, y'all done up and done it)<br />
And aww<br />
  (Y'all done up and done it, man, y'all done up and done it)<br />
<br />
Them country boys<br />
With them big fat wheels<br />
Peep the vertical grills<br />
And aww<br />
<br />
Them country boys<br />
With them big fat wheels<br />
Peep the vertical grills<br />
And aww<br />

Them country boys on the rise<br />
With them big fat wheels on the side<br />
Peep the vertical grills on the ride<br />
And aww<br />

With them big fat wheels<br />
Peep the vertical grills<br />
