We-Be-Burnin-:Sean Paul:6:2006-01-21

Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin' yo
Gal a make we please and we be thuggin' now
Sipping Hennesy an we'll be bubblin' yo
Set your mind at ease we got to take it slow

So when you see the S.P. floating don't provoke him
Cause the girls we be poking ganja smoking
Best thing for the recreation to get the best girls in every nation
Topper girls we promotin' and supportin'
And them love how we flow king hear them shouting
First class ticket invitation girls from New York, England and Jamaican

Everyday...

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody want to say
We be earnin' dollars turning cause we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds - girls, we need them everyday
Recognize it, we pimpin' as we riding

Girls them a page me want to raise me
True me write enough tune and drive them crazy
Well I man a true born Jamaican
Ready for the girls them in a every situation

We a the gal them pro, them know we flow
With the lyrical content that make them dip low and
Make the club keep jumpin'
Turn up the bass make you hear when that pumpin'

Summertime bounce to the music people choose it
Sean the P gal a cruise with... well reputed
Cause we a the girls them champion
Have enough a them like the great king Solomon

Many girls in a with eye sight sexy dress type
Se them ready for a hype night
Just gimme the light
An make we blaze it the roof we have to raise it again

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody want to say
We be earnin' dollars turning cause we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds - girls, we need them everyday
Recognize it, pimpin' as we riding

Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin' yo
Gal a make we please and we be thuggin' now
Sipping Hennesy an we'll be bubblin' yo
Set your mind at ease we got to take it slow

So when you see the S.P. floating don't provoke him
Cause the girls we be poking ganja smoking
Best thing for the recreation to get the best girls in every nation
Topper girls we promotin' and supportin'
And them love how we flow king hear them shouting
First class ticket invitation girls from New York, England and Jamaican

Everyday...

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody want to say
We be earnin' dollars turning cause we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds - girls, we need them everyday
Recognize it, pimpin' as we riding

Again...

We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody want to say
We be earnin' dollars turning cause we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds - girls, we need them everyday
Recognize it, pimpin' as we riding

Just gimme the gees an we be clubbin' yo
Gal a make we please and we be thuggin' now
Sipping Hennesy an we'll be bubblin' yo
