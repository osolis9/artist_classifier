Grove-St-Party:Waka Flocka Flame feat Kebo Gotti:10:2011-06-25

Grove, Grove St., Flocka

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep popping that's why the bad hoes jockeying
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Rolled up a lot, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

I step in the club, rolling on that loud shit
My weed keep your security saying, "Be quiet"
My breath is starting a riot, the girl's get excited
Hold on, wanna try it, I'm like, why not try it?

My swag they wanna buy it, my juice they wanna try it
Club going stupid when I, "Oh, let's do it"
Chu ain't gotta chew it, jerking and she moving
Grove St. villain, nigga, who you killing?

Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jacksons to the ceiling, that's how we balling
You know that I'm rolling, throwing up mean bread
Now I'm 'bout to meet her in the club with a heater

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep popping that's why the bad hoes jockeying
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Rolled up a lot, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

A party ain't a party 'til I walk in it
Lime green flap, match the fitted and the linen
Gucci shades are on my face and my lens kinda tinted
'Cause my eyes real low and my head just started spinning

I'm rolling like a motherfucker, I'm a roll out in this motherfucker
I'ma Roscoe Dash it, I'ma 'bout to show out in this motherfucker
My jewelry game on frost about to snow out in this motherfucker
Ay Flocka, get them burners, lets pull out in this motherfucker

Ay motherfucker, what the hell is you rocking for?
Run up on me and my squad, no, that shouldn't be an option so
Somebody betta let you know, I suggest that you let it go
This is a Grove St. party, fakers hit the exit door

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep popping that's why the bad hoes jockeying
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Rolled up a lot, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

Rolling on them leaves, you can do the lean
Blowing on that loud purp, pass that Bobby Brown back
The hood got my fucking back, the streets I'm not ducking that
Please step the fuck back, Grove St. yes, we are back

Hood plus I'm a nigga rich, every ghetto feeling this
20 on my right wrist, 30 on my left wrist
100 on my neck iced out for my respect
20 fucking 10, I'ma blow the whole check

In the club flex, after party flex
You know how we ball, all I know is ball
Every dollar in my pocket, I'ma spend it all
When a nigga die they gon' say, "Shawty raw"

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep popping that's why the bad hoes jockeying
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Rolled up a lot, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
