Put-On:Young Jeezy feat Kanye West:1:2008-10-18

The Recession on the way hey but on another note
Alot of soundin like Young tell 'em register to quote
See I rolled them back to back like I'm registered to smoke
Yea I got it on me now but I ain't registered to toke
I put on for my city and I bought a blue -ghini
Goddamnit just missed me, shoulda saw me shoulda seen me

Do me a favor see them haters tell 'em (Picture Me Rollin')
Same time watch them Feds take a, pic of me rollin'
Got a phone call from 'Ye put my -libs on his song
So 3 million like us goddamn I put 'em on

I put on for my city yeah billboards everywhere
See me before your flight land, see me before your bag claim
Re-up in my city man you better check your bags man
Shouts out to the Eastside yeah they play them bag games

Southside boys will fly to your home
Yeah they play them tag games
Can't forget that Westside yeah they play them mask games
How you forget the Northside, Don't know I stay high as hell

87 stickers too, y'all know I stay fly as hell
I put on for my city yeah way before the contracts
Trapstar step back might get you a contact
Rap star no strap might just get your chain snatched
Call young brain stacks might just get your chains back
Call my name in the courtroom put me on blast

Still shinin' on they ass yeah its Mr. Birthday Bash

I put on for my city, on, on for my city
I put on for my city, on, on for my city
Put on - Eastside

Put on - Southside
Put on - Westside
Put on... Let's go 'Ey Guru, put a lil' T-Pain on my shit too
Know what I mean? Uh
I put on... (Oh you bout to put on Hov?) G Mix

I don't need no T-Pain, I got this one, yes

I put Marcy on the map, I put Brooklyn on my back
I put Fab back on the charts, I put Biggie in my raps

I put Nas with Def Jam, I let Diddy do my tracks
I put on for my city that's a motherfucking fact
I put Mike Jack on stage at Summer Jam Billie Jean
I put Prodigy in his place on that Summer Jam screen
I put Preme in my truck told him leave them streets alone
I predicted jail would happen shit I tried to put him on
All these niggaz taking credit for the work that I put in
If you really put me on put yourself on then
I put miles on that hoopdie
I put hours in that kitchen
Put that on my "Dear Mama" this is fact not fiction
Feds were tryina build a case I was headed for conviction
Til the greatest flow in the world put me on television
I put on for my city so when I'm dead gone
I got one last wish put my Yankee hat on
