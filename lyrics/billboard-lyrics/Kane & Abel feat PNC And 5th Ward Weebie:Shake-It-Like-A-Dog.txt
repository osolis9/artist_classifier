Shake-It-Like-A-Dog:Kane & Abel feat PNC And 5th Ward Weebie:5:2001-01-13

[Kangol Slim]
We wanna see you hoes make it wiggle
Wanna see ya make it pop, make it jiggle
Why don't 'cha hit the floor and shake it up?
Turn around make it twerk, now back that ass up
[2x]

[Kangol Slim]
We done walked around with them boys
Kane & Abel, got my DJ Full Pack
Mixin' on the cross faddier and
We bout to let 'cha know
How it goes in the city
Ask anybody, about P-N-C
Be comin' with it, New Orleans, the city where I stay
Where them girls came down on a week and had a block part-ay
Hit the club, made the horn, in about four or five Benzs
Hit the stage, grabbed the mic, and knock the doors off the hinges

[5th Ward Weebie]
Now break me off shorty!
Don't forget about Lil' Weebie
Take it off shorty!
Where they pop shake, fuck
I'll pop it baby, once that
Booty start to wobble, you can't stop me baby
You can do it again, you can tear it down for me!
Show yo thong for me! Back it up
Put it in reverse, and drop it off for me!
Baby I know you love it, cuz that South
Be of the heezy, Kane & Abel
Hooked up with P-N-C and Lil' Weebie

[Chorus-Kangol Slim & 5th Ward Weebie]
Why don't ya shake it like a dog
Wobble baby, twerk it baby
Break a nigga off
Show me baby, hurt me baby
Shake it like a dog
Wobble baby, twerk it baby
Shake it like a dog
Shake it like a dog
[2x]

[Kane & Abel]
I wanna see girls do it
Bounce it, get in to it
I like the way you make that booty jiggle
When ya move it
Let me see how fast, you can make it go
Let me get ya butt naked, hoe I'll put ya in
My video, turn around baby
Let me see ya from the front
Make that tittie jump
I'm gettin' hot, I want some
Let me see ya drop down, get low
Make yo booty pop now, move slow
Pass that cucci to the left hand side trick
Let me see ya slide it, let me see ya ride it
Come here girl, won't 'cha break me off?
If  you ain't trippin', 
Won't 'cha take it off?
I wanna see you, baby can I met you?
I just wanna freak you,
Without the three, 
Most Wanted on the mic so go off
Make it bounce ,make it twerk
Now shake it like a dog

[Chorus-2x]

[Misdemeanor]
I'm from the city, where they take it off
I'm talkin' women, all colors
Straight break ya off
She approach, she a vet, watch her grab the wall
Wobble with it, wiggle with it
Shake it like a dog
Like a dog, wanna see 'em pop, pop, pop pop
Like to see 'em shake, shake shake shake
I like to see 'em back it up
Love to seem 'em act it up
She a pro not a slut
The way she tore it up
Shake it like a dog
Baby, do what 'cha do
Along with yo back girl, do what'cha do
Skinny boy on a fat girl, do what 'cha do
P-N-C, and Kane & Abel, bringin' you somethin' new
If you got a problem with us dog
Well It's All On U
I don't think you won't no static
So chill what 'cha do
Let me get somethin' straight,
Somethin' clear to you
Ya wanna see these hoes wobble
Then do what 'cha do

[Chorus-2x]
