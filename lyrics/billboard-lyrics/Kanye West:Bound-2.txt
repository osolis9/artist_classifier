feat. Charlie Wilson


[Hook]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
Uh huh honey

[Post-Hook]
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Uh huh honey

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walkin' 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, yo ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty winin' 'round all these Jamaicans
Ugh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge 1: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh huh honey

[Pre-Hook]
Close your eyes and let the world paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, canâ€™t get spunk on the mink
I mean damn what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, aye yo we made it, Thanksgiving
So aye, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge 2: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
No hiding your love, no hiding, no hiding
Just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh huh honey

[Outro]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Bound (Bound to fall in love)
Uh huh honey
