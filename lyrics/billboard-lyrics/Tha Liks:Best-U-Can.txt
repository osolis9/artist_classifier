Best-U-Can:Tha Liks:14:2001-08-25

Let's get it pumped up, pumpin', the jump-off to jumpin'
Aiyyo I'm lookin' in your eyes you look a little drunkin' pumpkin
You buzzin', oh really, you faded kinda early
These my homeboys, introduce your home girlies

What's your name? Shirley, well this my nizzle swivel
He like the way you pop it, like the way your booty wiggle
Y'all 'bout it? We 'bout it, everybody crowd around it
Mouths hit the floor, all my niggaz look astounded

Dom P? Hell naj, that shit a waste of money
We drink that Cristal, Dom P be tastin' funny
You a Likqit bunny, and I'm Hugh Hef'
After Tash get to mackin', y'all can have who's left

'Cause, with this game, Tash legal and all
If ain't home, call me back
'Cause I've been screenin' my calls, all y'all gotta pause
'Cause we know what y'all broads really want

You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best U can
I can tell you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best U can

He's on his way to the club, puffin' on a dub
He never wait in line, 'cause he always get love
He's drinkin' it, drinkin' up, drikin' all the time
He can't hold it back, he's lookin' for a dime

He say two drinks and the ass is mine
She play dudes like him just passin' time
So they hop inside, the Cadillac
The chaffeur drove off, and it never came back

She say, ay daddy, do you like that?
He say, yeah mami, just like that
She say, you know I never did this before
He say, yeah, sure tell me more

Knock on wood grain, the whole hood sayin'
You give good brains, I ain't playin'
A little champagne, but no damn rain
And the next week it was the same damn thang

You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best U can
You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best U can, yeah

Yo I know you want me little mama, but tell me what you think about
Girls like you drain a bank account
The cars, the ice, the clothes, the dough
All that for slidin' down a pole?

I'm state of the art, you still playin' your part
A nigga like Tash'll make it pump from the start
Game pump from my heart like oil through a pipeline
You waitin' on some chips, you might wait like three lifetimes

Mack and Ro, crackin', crackin'
Drop them fat back down to the flo'
Do it for the dough, professional
Make a dude wanna blow his whole cash flow

You know you want me mama, I know you want me mama
You want me to be your man, show me you want me girl
Neptunes make it bounce around the world and back
Make you do the damn thang, when the club is packed, yeah

You know you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best U can
I can tell you want me mama, you want me to be your man
But if you really want me girl, you gotta wiggle the best U can, yeah
