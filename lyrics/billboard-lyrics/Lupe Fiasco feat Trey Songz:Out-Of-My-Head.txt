Out-Of-My-Head:Lupe Fiasco feat Trey Songz:4:2011-07-09

Girl I want you to know (whoo)
I can't get you out of my head
My head my head (naaw)

Girl I want you to know
I don't even know what you did
You did you did
But I love it

Uh Uh
Everything hooks
Everything works, you're a real good chorus
I'm a real good verse, freestyle unrehearsed
So clean no curse
And when the song's gone man everything hurts
So I put it in reverse
Go back to the scene where I seen you first
Yeah, I need you to sing that single again
Play that video I seen you up in
A hundred million spins in my mind all day
Call in and request on the line always
Yeah, the president of your fan club
Leave them players all behind like a bad love

Girl I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head
My head my head (I can't get you out now)

Girl I want you to know
I don't even know what you did
You did you did
But I love it (Wait)

Playa need a minute
Like a time out in tennis 'for I finish
How'd I get in this
Maybe 'was your hair, maybe 'was your flair
Maybe it's the heels and the way you wear
Maybe it's you're real and the way you care
You don't care if I'm ill or a millionaire
The only thing that matters that the feeling's there
Your smile is so bright it's like a grills in there
High off life, don't need a pill in there (nah)
You're killing me, I think I need a will in here
Got me feeling real skills impaired
Hard to describe why you're still in here

Girl I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head
My head my head

Girl I want you to know
I don't even know what you did
You did you did
But I love it (but I love it)

[Bridge: Trey Songz & Lupe Fiasco]
Don't care what nobody say
Cause I like it girl
Might go crazy try'na figure this out love 
(but I like it girl)
Don't even know why I feel this way
Cause I like it girl
Caught up in something that I can't get out of 
(but we like it girl)

Girl I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head 
(I can't get you out now)
My head my head 
(said I can't get you out now)

Girl I want you to know
I don't even know what you did
You did you did (you did you did you did)
But I love it

Girl I want you to know (I want you to know)
I can't get you out of my head (lupe)
My head my head (trey)
I want you to know (yeah)

Girl I want you to know (oh oh oh)
I don't even know what you did (just making sure)
You did you did (i don't even know)
But I love it
I can't get you out of my head (lupe, trey)
My head
