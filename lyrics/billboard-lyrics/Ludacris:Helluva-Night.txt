Helluva-Night:Ludacris:23:2013-09-07

It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
Mustard on the beat, ho
Luda!

Rollin down the highway
Nothing for me to do but smoke, it's habitual Friday
Break it down, spread it out, nigga roll up
And let's see what they about, call them hoes up
Ludacris, man these bitches want my last name
Sippin slow but I'm drivin all in the fast lane
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch
And hoodie yappin if you never wanna do shit
I'm all about it, get yo mind right
Been making money since before I was in the lime light
Grind like – bitch, wussup!
Top down but I feel like getting fucked up
I get high but the bass low
A real nigga, watch a woman wanna shake fo
When you shake it for a baller better shake it right
'Cause it's about to be a hell of a night

It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night

I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
(It's about to be a hell of a night)

Club packed and one nigga and they drink on
Just lookin for a reason to get they freak on
Catch me up in the VIP and it's roaped off
To keep raggedy ass hoes off
Then I'm bout to have a smoke off
Rich nigga but I'm tryna get broke up
Turn it up as I make the beat break down
Ass up, face down
Yea, that's still the best way to get it
Down the middle, that's the best way to split it
I'm talkin money, disturbin the peace, racked up
One too many American black cards stacked up
Backed up and it's on
Don't get beat down til it's on
I feel these hatin ass niggas wanna fire
What?
It's about to be a hell of a night

It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night

I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
(It's about to be a hell of a night)

I'm always looking for trouble to get into
Take your girlfriend's friends, bring friends too
What you drinkin? I got it all, pour it all up
So stay, my partners – they throw it all up
I don't want a ménage so bitch let go
I'm tryna get 3 women, play connect 4
Congratulations, you made it into the top 5
Your mouth help me, push the Bentley into Mach 5
She got me speedin in the red zone
Always Luda like they callin this the head zone
Hands up, I bread win and the bread's up
So make a peace sign, baby put yo legs up
Is it really that good to ya?
Do you like it when a nigga talk hood to ya?
Do you like a little scratch, a little bite?
Well, It's about to be a hell of a night

It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night

I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
(It's about to be a hell of a night)
