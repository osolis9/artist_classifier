Bow-Wow-That-s-My-Name-:Lil Bow Wow:1:2001-07-28

Say, say, my name is
Say, bow wow wow
Bow Wow, yeah
Snoop Dogg, yeah, uh, my name is

Hair nappy but I'm happy, pocket full of dough
From the C.O. representin' So So
The girls recognize an' these niggas do too
I'm the flyest thing walkin' through junior high school

So make room next to your little Backstreet poster
'Cause Bow Wow's here an' it's over, ya heard
I'm this, I'm that, I'm all of the above
In a big body shotgun ridin' on dub's

I've been seen with the baddest, heard with the best
An' I got it locked down from the East to the West
Look at my eyes, ya know, I ain't playin'
That's why all through the streets, all I hear niggas sayin' is

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
An' all my girls around the world that love how it's goin' down say

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
An' all the girls around the world that love how it's goin' down

Now that the gates wide open, it is I who they runnin' from
Little with the ill crossover like Iverson
In two kay, my way an' I'm the first to rock
First to drop, ice in the bezel of a G-Shock

Like Big an' Pac, I'm hard to forget
What makes it even worse, I'm just gettin' started
Yeah, that's me that's got your daughter in a frenzy
Yeah, that's me that's got her arguin' with her friends

About who? Gone, gimme when they see me
Sayin', "Do you see him, ooh, he the man"
Thirteen, game locked, don't trip
All that an' a bag of chips, "Hi, my name is"

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
An' all my girls around the world that love how it's goin' down say

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
An' all the girls around the world that love how it's goin' down

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Woof motherfuck the Dogg came to play
Calgon, Calgon, take me away
I'm in the dirty dirty with my nephew J

Dizzy, izzy, boy we gettin' busy
With Lil' Bow Wizzy, this shit is off the heezy
I threw him like a frisbee an' yeah, he came back
Like, uh, boomerang, Dogg Pound game

Hundred thousand dollar chains
What'chu say J.D.? Bling, bling, money ain't a thang
Ya ask me again an' I'mma tell you the same
I'm flippin' on these niggas,  while I'm trippin' on these niggas

Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
You standin' on the wall, nigga bust a bus
But you can't trust her, it's good game
An' all my niggas represent yo' bang

Put it up, now click clack it up an' all the niggas bag it up
'Cause I wanna smack it up
We do it to ya Doggystyle
Big Bow Wow in yo' mouth, bow wow
