Get-Up:Cocoa Brovaz:9:2001-03-03

Yeah, yeah, yeah
This for my niggas worldwide
In the parks
In the yard
In the bar
Ya knawmean
(Yeah yeah) This shit over the top (Where NY at?)

some lines will be added and withdrawn through the song

Check the steel on the track make ya (Get up)
Big guns cocked back make ya (Get up)
Bob Marley spliff back'll make ya (Get up)
Big 6 on 20 inch make ya (Get up)
(Come on)


Jam session in the park
Smith-N-Wessun start
Charge when the session spark
Brooklyn test ya heart
New York City, Bucktown Commity
Stay busy, break big bricks and stay gritty


We stay sick
How I sweat shit
I'm 12 cylinder, you in a V6
Don't hate shit
Congradulate bitch
Get ya weight and count up
Fuck your weight dick


You wanna take this
Then take six (buck)
Hot shots leave you faceless or wasted
Learn the basics
We make you famous
Make the papers
Make you find your faces when you play this


I don't know why you comin' trough school-faced-up
Blue-faced-up
Frontin' like a dog ya mut
Get touched up slap
Thinkin that you teflon proof
Smack the po tryna get away and rap the proof


add lines
When BK in the spot ya know ya gotta (Get up)
When my new shit drop watch ya all (Get up)
Every time we in ya hood watcha (Get up)
Let a half a clip loose at ya watcha (Get up)


Y'all dudes keep rhymin', freestylin' for health
Like Nike I just do it for wealth
Shoot dice in the park, stack guns on the shelf
Hate dependin' on niggas, so I get it for delf


These niggas come thru in the club
When ya get the crush, anything that go down
Gotta deal wit us
If we aint dealin' bucks
It don't appeal to us
If these ladies keep it real
The they can chill wit us
? bread bill wit us
What will we discuss? Bills by the break truck
All rocks taped up


I got a staff of staffs
Airs chipped to pups
Instead of attackin' the nuts when I yell clip up
I got gunners and runners in the hood I stay
Til this day, never saw you where I lay
Fuck the smoke, must want yo life to close
Get found buckwheated on a darkened road


I know you've been waitin'
Whisperin' and talkin'
Magazines I read ya reviews
Tryna downplay the shit my team do
I caught up on my fanmail, email, online
P & C we still shine
And I'll ride for my fam cuz I'll die for mines



NY (NY) Hometown (Hometown) ST (Smokin' live)
Throwin' down (What)


Niggas in the parkinglots comin' from clubs
Cleanin' out your pockets to these big faced dubs


Rep for my P & C, for my family
Niggas wanna challenge me, U know the rest
The game is supposed to be sold, not told
Just tell me the number of sells ya wanna hold
We control this, forocious
Aproach this, you can hold this
I beat niggas in the with G and guns
Might do your own thing but you still my son
This strong off chain, all four cream
Tour bigger things, better livin' for the seeds
We videotape hoes in Navigators
Cause I told these haters it'll get greater later'



Get Up X 10
