Things-I-ve-Seen:Spooks:13:2000-05-27

You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme
I've seen the beauty of the universe
So peaceful and serene
In seconds turn to violence and screams

I've seen true genius
Too often to lose the meaningless
Appreciation of this mediocre nation
I've heard the mind is repetition
Of empty words without tradition
Turned original verbs into submission

I smelled this malignerance addiction
But I guess I wouldn't be right
If I said the blunt was like a baby pipe
There ain't gon' be no revolution tonight
Half of my warriors as high as a kite
Lost and they lost all they fight

And I've tasted, the bitter tragedy of lives wasted
And men who glimpsed the darkness inside, but never faced it
And it's a shame that most of y'all are followin' sheep
Wallowin' deeper than the darkness, you're fallin' asleep

You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme
I've seen the beauty of the universe
So peaceful and serene
In seconds turn to violence and screams

I've seen and experienced things
That'll push the average to the edge and swan dive to death
I'm two guys, multiplied by ninety-three guys
Evenly balanced seein' evil equally in each eye now
Maybe I'm the most thorough worker on the job to you
Or maybe I'm the one, who was plottin' to rob you

The fear of this beat down, the women on no cash to floss
Makes most of y'all hustle ya ass off
From nothin' to two mill', in five years I'll live to see it
Vanish in six months, with no tears believe it
I'll rock, twenty-eight years before the Feds can lay a trace
See, they plan is to erase me, just to replace me

Life, your heart is one with your brain
Emotional or reason, now which one do you obey?
Life, somebody callin' you insane
When overwhelmed and blessed
Burst in tears of happiness

Yo, yo, I've seen relationships that's so sick
Life long friendships so chaotic
Thug cat bangin' this chick but won't kiss
Drinkin' her spit, when coppin' a fix for dope bliss

I got a knife and a bat, to bust your brain
Put a knife in your back
"Once in the Life" I was trifle like that
Like my man Troy, who lost his days
Shootin' dice on worldly ways

And ended up in a early grave
Because once in a lifetime is rough
Twice in a lifetime you combat the ghost of mistrust
Mentally cuffed, thrust by a cop thinkin' he tough
You bust, Amadou Diallo is us, and what

Now I'm on my knees, beggin', "God, please
Save me from the fires of hell, let water, water soul prevail,"
'Cos I can't take no more, who's that knockin', at, my door?
Is that you, Pete from Cobb's Creek, who died in my sleep?
We was playin' for fun, now it's keeps

Like my man Mark I beat to death wrapped in a carpet
And left in the garbage, damn, now that's cold hearted
Ask Book he saw it, "Yo black I ain't seen shit
Kids in the 6, they flip for nonsense"
Poke an icepick, smokin' that shit since preschool fool
And packin' a tool, fuck you Mom Dukes it's cool

You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme
I've seen the beauty of the universe
So peaceful and serene
In seconds turn to violence and screams

Life, your heart is one with your brain
Emotional or reason, now which one do you obey?
Life, somebody callin' you insane
When overwhelmed and blessed
Burst in tears of happiness
