Get-Big:Dorrough:16:2010-08-14

What you got a dollar in your pocket, a twenty in your wallet?
See, me, I'm stacking money, matter of fact, I'll let you watch it

Get big, get big, get big, get big
You ain't got 'nough money
You aint got 'nough money
Get big, get big, get big, get big

Hundreds, fifties, bitch, I don't exaggerate
This a game for ballers, only ballers can participate
All these niggas frontin', throwin' money like they paper long
Ear big diamonds throwing paper now they paper gone

Idiot, what are you? Coach, we need a W
And this nigga game suck, I think its time to substitute
Are there really diamonds in your ear? Somebody hustled you
Checking out your revenue, boy, you know don't know what to do

Ha, so you better double hustle your fees
Your broke-ass rass ain't got enough cheese
And you out and lookin' phony, tryin' to stunt like me
Nigga please, oh, broke-ass nigga

What you got a dollar in your pocket, a twenty in your wallet?
See me I'm stacking money, matter of fact, I'll let you watch it

Get big, get big, get big, get big
You ain't got 'nough money
You aint got 'nough money
Get big, get big, get big, get big

See, money I can talk about, bitch, I'm 'bout the run the South
Walk around my city in my Dallas, Texas fitted cap
I'll be gettin' money from you bitches, what you talking about?
Spending all your money on these bitches what is that about? Nothin'

I'll be making stupid cash
Get special attention like them niggas in the stupid class
Watch me, youngster, motherfucking monster
Playing with this paper like I'm playing in the dumpster

Your baby-mama's paying all yo' bills, yous a busta
Even though she work a nine to five, she still a hustler
Yea, that means she's running things while here you out here looking lame
Damn, what a shame, oh, broke-ass nigga

What you got a dollar in your pocket, a twenty in your wallet?
See me I'm stacking money, matter of fact, I'll let you watch it

Get big, get big, get big, get big
You ain't got 'nough money
You aint got 'nough money
Get big, get big, get big, get big

Lil' mama know I'm in her city and I'm out here looking pretty
Getting money 'til it's silly, I'm just out on my diddy
What she say? She like, "Yea, he did that
Ooh, girl, yeah, I like the way he did that"

Girl, you know I'm gritty, touchy-touchy, feely, feely
First, I stimulate the kitty then I hit her with this willy
What she say? Yeah, buddy, she like, "Yea, he did that
Ooh, girl, yeah, I like the way he did that"

Get big, get big, get big, get big, get big
Get big, get big, get big, get big, get big
