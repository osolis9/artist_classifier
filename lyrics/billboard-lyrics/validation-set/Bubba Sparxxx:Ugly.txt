Ugly:Bubba Sparxxx:6:2001-11-24

Say what, say what?
Freaky, freaky, Bubba

Shit, I ain't choose to rhyme, rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin', like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you

'Cause this is Bubba's moment, I put my mother on it
I said my momma, it seems as if I love her, don't it?
So buckle up 'cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's an' my shit's grumpies

That Bubba talk gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated, at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits

But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it 'cause I just leap through you
What you need to do is just admit you love me
The South has always been dirty but now it's gettin' ugly

It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger with every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days an' came with somethin' that truly matters

On goes the saga of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now, I hate it came to this
How else can I say it? I don't speak no other languages

I'm fairly ripped now, so this the Jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows, fuck  it, break a bottle
Let's be honest, none of us will ever date a model

So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'
This that new South, take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend an' this is gettin' ugly

It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

Now this thang is jumpin', ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'
Now you see it triples, I bet she slurp tonight
Lames, hide your wallets, hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight

If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd
An' if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud
An' if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet, I know you had a long drought

Don't worry about the law, they can't arrest us all
I had to crank, couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions, I wanna see you whylin'
An' if Bubba dies tonight, know he was smilin'

It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly
In here, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
In here, in here

Check the switch
Switch it one time
Now switch it back, baby
Switch it one time
Now switch it back, baby

C'mon, Bubba, let's go
