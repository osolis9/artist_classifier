Slow-Motion:Juvenile feat Soulja Slim:1:2004-11-20

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Uh , I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurtin'
Cut throat will have her like a brand new virgin
It's like when she gets used of it, then you start servin'
Hop on top and start jiggy-jiggy jerkin'

Slow down for me, you movin' too fast
My fingers keep slippin', I'm trying to grip that ass
Keep bein' hard headed and I'ma make you get on me
Got a human up disguise but my face is a doggy

If you loving my ball, let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches fell in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick, like

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

It's like I got the world in my palms, your girl up under my arms
She fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick still hard from 12 till early in the morn
Fine bitches if you listenin' you heard me, I'm strong

If you goin' through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard 'bout hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't tellin' the truth baby you know they was wrong
Now, make it official when I'm summin' that dom

I don't mind buyin' blue, you ridin' too
Don't be asking a nigga question, 'bout where I'm drivin' you
Lil' mama my shit together, I ain't jivin' you
I don't think that nigga could do you better than I could do, you know

The juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga used to be runnin' with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from tha Nolia get a chance with it
But I can't bounce with you without usin' my hands with it

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Slow motion, she open, I'm hopin' she don't leave my dick broken
With brush, burns and swollen
I'm totin' she won't be needed to make her out of  believe her
I guarantee I'ma see ya when I see ya

And just don't holla out my name like we was all in
Yo pussy throwback, and you know that
So stop stuntin', slow motion for a real nigga
I'm gone off that incredible potion and I'm on deal with you

I like how them Victoria secrets sit in that ass
Lemme pour some more Hyp and Hennessey in ya glass
But I be violatin', if I grabbed me a handfull?
I'm knowin' whats happenin', all I want is a sample

Who you wit ? I'm in a rental today
Its goin' down in Hamptown Inn and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What is gonna take that get you to come in slow motion with me like?

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me

Uh, I like it like that, she workin' that back
I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Move in slow motion for me
