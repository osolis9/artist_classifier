Gangstas-Make-The-World-Go-Round:Westside Connection:10:1997-06-07

I am gettin' dizzy as the world keeps spinnin' like a frisbee
Gangstas and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what I'm facin'
But give me 7 seas and 11 G's
I make enough cheese to bring Wall Street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the Empire State Building full of 1's

Go to school is what you tell us
But niggas in school is scared of the Good Fellas
We got the Yayo, you can just say no
But nobody makes a fuckin' move until I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro

Ya honor I'm have to get rid of ya
Because it ain't no trivia about my flat in West Bolivia
I blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Then swim the big fish
You fuckin' guppies

Gangstas make the world go round

Not just saggin' waving my flag
And never will I ease up nigga so stop askin'
See I was taught as a tiny loc on the set
It's all about the pussy and money, fuck the rest
Nigga this tech is quicker to collect
When I'm seekin' all the jewelery and the money
So miss me with that preachin' teaching
Fuck all that bullshit I want to slang yae
Like Noriega sit back watch my paper
Collect like the I.R.S. as I kick it with 50 bitches
All on my dick just like the president

And like the police I want a gang of killers all on my side
That's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride
On my behalf while I call shots as if I was Saddam Hussein
Jackin' motha fuckas for Dana Danes
Hated by many bit I don't care
Because I rather be feared than loved with a pocket full of dubs
Because gangsta gangstas make the world go round and if
You want a piece then you best to be down
So quit chastising me analyzing me and like the escorts
Look over your shoulder nigga it's plain to see
Crooked ass cowards

Gangstas make the world go round

360 degrees like my D's the world be spinning
Nigga's been sinning since the beginning
History's a trip so I peep when I am reading
Nigga's probably grew weed in the garden of Eden
Before big ballin' sex cars and loot
It's like bitches been scandalous biting forbidden fruit
But gangstas don't deal with that shit, on the West side
And since they regulating hoes I rose with the best side

So check it as my lifetime is ticking
Coming up strong licking and flipping chickens
Need cheese in amounts of Gs
I gave up sports to slang Keys
But blamed it on my knees
Make sure I got what I need
To make up your order
Everything from baggies triple beams to jugs for my water

Like a snitch life's a bitch a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song your momma sings
Just surge your ass your on your way to killa king nigga
So now I stand with heat in my hand for my whole life span
'Cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it keep it loaded devoted since quoted
Fo sho One-O got the ups on these prankstas
While my world keep twisting as a West side gangsta
Foe life nigga

Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round
Gangstas make the world go round
Around
