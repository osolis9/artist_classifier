Pretty Ricky Push It Lyrics

i wanna see you push it push it push it
i wanna see you move it move it move it
i wanna see you wind it wind it wind it

i wanna see you push it baby oh just push that thang on me
push it baby i wanna see you move i wanna see you

when i step up in the club-im so flly i i
tossing dollars at these bras like ah ah ah
pretty woman up in here like bah bah bah
spittin game in their ear like - lalalalalalaa
baby blue i dont play no games
head to my feet so fresh so clean
buyin out the bar like it aint no thang
hot boy like wayne
diamonds in my chain blang blang blang
Got canary diamond clutas (ridin bustas)
got the matching lamborghini same color mustard
Buyin drinks for these chicks, sayin' now they owe me
mo gin if u wine i'm the same ol g

i wanna see you push it push it push it
i wanna see you move it move it move it
i wanna see you wind it wind it wind it

i wanna see you push it baby oh just push that thang on me
push it baby i wanna see you move
