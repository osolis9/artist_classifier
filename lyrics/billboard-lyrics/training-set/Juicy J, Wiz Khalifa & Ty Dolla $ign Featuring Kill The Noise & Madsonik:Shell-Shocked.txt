Shell-Shocked:Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa & Ty Dolla $ign Featuring Kill The Noise & Madsonik:17:2014-09-20

Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

That's my fam, I'll hold â€˜em down forever
Us against the world, we can battle whoever
Together ain't no way we gon' fail
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nun-chucks doors and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my Rolex, it say I'm the man of the hour
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power

(All for one when we fight together)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
(All for one when we ride together)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
(All for one when we fight together)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
(This family can bear any weather)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

Ain't nothing that could come in between me and my brothers
We all around if it's going down
It's just us, all for one, yeah you hear 'em right
Our business done, we disappear into the night
Came up together, so we all down for the fight
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Family, ain't nothing strong as that
And I'll be posted up where the strong is at
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes
That's what the people want
They ain't born, gotta create 'em
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em
That's part of the plan, by my side I'mma keep my brothers
Live or die man we need each other

Four hitters, four winners
Tryna tell 'em you don't wanna go to war with us
We be them, we be them, young riders
Raised in the gutter, really started from the bottom
hey, we all we ever had, we all we ever needed and we undefeated
We be goin' hard, and make it look easy
Give me the whole pie, real cheesy
I told your girl no, but you might not believe me
She took a picture for me, told her smile for me
Pass her off I'm a real team player
Bandanna on my face like a gangster
