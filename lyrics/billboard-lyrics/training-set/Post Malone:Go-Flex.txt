Go-Flex:Post Malone:18:2017-11-04

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen to what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup, blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

[Hook x2]
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

[Verse 2]
Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

[Hook]
