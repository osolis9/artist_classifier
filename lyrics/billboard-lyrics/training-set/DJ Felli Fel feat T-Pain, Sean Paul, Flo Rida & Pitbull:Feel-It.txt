She can be from Thailand that way that she bang cock
I'm telling, your mami do anything
And she throwing it back like a b-b-boomerang

Like a belly ring, badabing, hm, badaboom
Now dim the lights down in the room
While I slide in you like, ooh can you feel it naughty?

Look there's a spot on your neck, for sure your bottom is next
