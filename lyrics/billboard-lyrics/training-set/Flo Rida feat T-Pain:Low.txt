Mmmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em
Mmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
C'mon!

Shawty had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know

Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Hey, I've never seen somethin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spending my do'
Had the million dollas vibe and a body to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible professional
Drinkin' nexenol
Hold up wait a minute! Do I see what I think. I whooaaaah!!!

Did her thing seen shawty get low

Ain't the same when it's up that close

Make it rain I'm makin' it snow

Work the pole I gotta bang bro'
I'mma say that I perfer the no clothes
I'm into that I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't a problem I know where it go
She had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her

She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants

And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)

She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home

My jeans filled with guap and they ready for showin'
Cadillacs layed back for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make your moan
1 stack (come on) 2 stacks (come on) 3 stacks (come on)
Now thats 3 grand

What you think I'm playin' baby-girl I'm the man
I'm dealing rubberbands

Thats, when I threw her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That heny and cola got me like a soldier
She ready for rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky on me I was just like clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster

Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her
Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)

The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)

She hit the floor (she hit the floor)

Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Whoooah shawty, yeah she was worth the money.
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tatoo above her crack

I had to handle that
I was zoned in sexy woman
Let me show it, make me want it
2 in the morning I'm zoned in
Them rose bottles foaming
She wouldn't stop
Made it drop
Shawty dipped that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fired just like my glock
Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a slap (heeey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
C'mon
