The-Way-You-Move:OutKast feat Sleepy Brown:1:2004-05-01

Booom, booom, booom

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxin', OutKast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little actin'

Now that's for anyone askin', give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an ear gasm
Now you cumin' out the side of your face
We tappin' right into your memory banks, thanks

So click-it-or-ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin', like two midgets in the backseat rasslin'
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag

But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B A S S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B A S S bass?

I like the way you move
I like the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turnin' left, turnin' right, are they lookin' at me?
Well I was lookin' at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now they got me in the middlin', feelin' like a man-whore

'Specially the big girl
Big guls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak

Skinny slim women got the camel toe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop

Take a deep breath an exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's borin' as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low hoe

I like the way you move
I like the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine
You drivin' me out of my mind

Ooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baby
Ooh 'cause you light me and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo

I like the way you move
I like the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I like the way you move
I like the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move, whoo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
