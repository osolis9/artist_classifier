What-Would-You-Do-:City High:1:2001-07-28

Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night, was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowin' the cup
About 5, 6 strippers tryin' to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside wit me
Her name was Lonni, she went to Jr. High wit me
I said, "Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last"

She said, "What would you do if your son was at home
Cryin' all alone on the bedroom floor?
Cuz he's hungry, and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man
For a little bit of money and his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lockdown, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life"

Girl, you ain't the only one wit a baby
That's no excuse to be livin' all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said, "Every day I wake up hopin' to die"
She said, "Nigga, I know about pain 'cuz
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager, I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to"

What would you do if your son was at home
Cryin' all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cuz he's hungry, and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man
For a little bit of money and his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lockdown, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life

{No, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Stop the record, yo, stop the record!
Yo, Shorty, you ain't gotta be goin' out like this, man!
Holdup!}

What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
'Cuz I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop makin' up tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby, you can do it

What would you do if your son was at home
Cryin' all alone on the bedroom floor?
Cuz he's hungry, and the only way to feed him
Is to sleep with a man
For a little bit of money and his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lockdown, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life
