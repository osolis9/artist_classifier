Turn-It-Up-Remix-Fire-It-Up:Busta Rhymes:1:1998-08-29

It's Busta Rhymez, they do much more
So yo you one more time, knucklehead flow that
You act real dumb, yo, I'm pert near fool
Lights out when, let it rip like my neck
With search warrant, I make sure everything we make is raw

I make sure everything we make is raw
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When I step up in the place, ay
You I step correct, ooh, ah ooh, ah
Got you all in check, I got that head nod
That make you break ya neck
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, got you all in check

And you know we come through, to wreck the disco tech
Ooh, ah, ooh, I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, and never disrespect
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, I got you all in check

Busta Rhymes up in the place, true indeed
Yes, I catch wreck and that's word on my seed
I'm guaranteed to give you what you need
One blood everybody like junior reed

Make up every morning, I must succeed
Nationwide ruckus make the world stampede
Yo, Willie make we roll some
Made charge now I must proceed

Yo, we bout to make moves set speed
Peace to baby phife cue-tip ali-shaheed
Watch me knock you out like Apollo creed
Body blows bustin' you makin' you bleed

Just feed off the dynamic flows and take heed
Need more information, homeboy then just read
Ay, you can read all about the pure breed
Do the boggle dance man, do the pepper seed

When I step up in the place, ay
You I step correct, ooh, ah ooh, ah
Got you all in check, I got that head nod
That make you break ya neck
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, got you all in check

And you know we come through, to wreck the disco tech
Ooh, ah, ooh, I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, and never disrespect
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, I got you all in check

How dare you ever try
To step on my suede shoes
Top Gun down your firm like Tom Cruise
Please, let me get down and blow a fuse

Actin' fools, brakin' down to molecules
Yo, let me hit you with my ill street blues
Busta Rhymez always headlines the street news
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

Ah, baby girl, don't be confused
Sail my Seven Seas and enjoy my boat cruise
I know you really want to know who's
Comin' through leavin stains and residues
Sorry homeboy but your flow sounds used

Got to pay your dues, baby, you know the rules
Whenever I travel the world I land cruise
If you choose to around, you get bruised
Now, I got you gas on super unleaded fuels
Give me room gimme some space yo excuse

When I step up in the place, ay
You I step correct, ooh, ah ooh, ah
Got you all in check, I got that head nod
That make you break ya neck
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, got you all in check

And you know we come through, to wreck the disco tech
Ooh, ah, ooh, I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, and never disrespect
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, I got you all in check

You're now rockin' with the best
Busta Rhymez coming through from the flip mode squad
Boy scouts who I be straight to your dome
We comin' straight to your dome

Bringin' all the ruckus, to all you rad mother
Boy scouts who I be flip mode is da squad
Busta Rhyme break it down like this
Yo, which mother stole my flow, eenie meenie minie moe

Throw them type a right out my window
Blast they hit them from a direct blow
Bo, comin' through like G.I. Joe
Star wars movin' like Han Solo

Make you bounce around like this was calypso
Always shine 'cause I got the hi-pro glow
You think that you can hide, you think you can lay low
Roll up on you like Hawaii 5-0

Make out with my dreads in my kangol
Forget the moe just pass the cisco yo, take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that that might make you psycho
Maximum frequency through your stereo
Sorry, this is it but homeboy I gotta go

When I step up in the place, ay
You I step correct, ooh, ah ooh, ah
Got you all in check, I got that head nod
That make you break ya neck
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, got you all in check

And you know we come through, to wreck the disco tech
Ooh, ah, ooh, I got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, and never disrespect
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, I got you all in check

Yeah, hey, hey, yo hey
