Errrbody say they got a hater
Errrbody got paper

But who is me to be talking about the next nigga out here flexing? When I did it before
And who is you to talk about this whip ain't mine?
When you see a nigga hit it with the top-down?
Oh, you sound like a hater on the front line
Imma hit the block for you one more time
Errrbody got something to say
Errrbody wanna hate if you ask me
Err bitch gay
In the club dancing on her friend trying to pretend
We ain't know you go both ways
Err nigga think that shit cool

Tell ya eater her pussy, then you cant be mad
Cause you shouldn't have gave me the wrong picture.

Hoes go rollin, it's a check on my wrist.
Ooo, I'm about to blow a check in this bitch
Truth be told I don't even drink

Nobody snatching my chain, true street nigga
I ain't in nobody lane.

Errrbody going to the mall
Buying new designer
Niggas got a 100 dollar liner
Got a hermes H belt on some BG jeans
Child support looking high, don't know where to find them
Couple of niggas balling in the club
Poppin bottles, buying booths
But if a nigga wanna know the truth
Still owe the plug, and he rented that coupe
And his watch ain't real and his chain ain't too.
Shorty got a million some followers
And a million some problems
But she's a different person on the gram
Meet her in person you like shorty
Where all your purses, what about your hair, and car?
Shorty you ain't got none
Errrbody need to be there self.
Errrbody Famous, ain't regular people left.
Errrbody smoking on Cush, if you smoking regular
You know you gotta smoke by yourself.
