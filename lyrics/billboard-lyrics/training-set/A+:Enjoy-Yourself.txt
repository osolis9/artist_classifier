Enjoy-Yourself:A+:11:1998-11-28

Enjoy yourself, 9-8, get it straight

Yes yes y'all steady playin' the wall
Too young to sip alcohol at the bar
I'm ready to jet-girls acting bourgeois
Yo kedar let me hold the keys to the car

Im in front of the club tryin' to bag a chick
Tryin' to get five of 'em 'cuz the whip seats six
Feelin' aiight, chrome lookin' real tight
Watch the moonlight bounce off the pearl white

Word money, I earn money just to burn money
Tryin' to get this federal reserve money
There's two types of artists, expert and novice
Experts always hit the mark of their target

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
You gotta enjoy yourself c'mon

'Cuz I'm the baddest foundation ever established
Me and my team bubble like Alka Seltzer tablets
Don't sleep when its time to creep
A little pimp like me will crawl underneath

It takes alot more than words to move me
I don't give a P H U K what u say
Actin' all wild, unprofessional
Who got beef, knock the teeth out yo smile

My lyrical lubricant keeps the crowd movin'
You get booed 'cuz your stage show needs improvement
So if you wanna see A+ the artist
You gotta western union your key grand deposit

Cats out there steady kickin' garbage
You can't harm me or stop me
Even on a poor quality bootleg cassette

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, for me
You gotta enjoy yourself c'mon

Take your time, make up your mind
Down been for sure down been to the mind
Real fools never fall in love
Stealin' my heart is like stealin' a car with the club

Nevertheless I get an occasional crush
Say some romantic stuff that make u wanna blush
Girls in all flavors, no matter what they race is
Rhymes amazin' making, craig mack faces

Take her back to the lab and touch three bases
Take my time, don't wanna catch no rape cases
Kiss on the forehead and say goodnight
A+ y'all and I'm out like 3 strikes

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
You gotta enjoy yourself c'mon

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
You gotta enjoy yourself, you gotta enjoy yourself c'mon

C'mon, c'mon enjoy yourself
C'mon,
