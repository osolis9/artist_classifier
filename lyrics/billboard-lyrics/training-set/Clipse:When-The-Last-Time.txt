When-The-Last-Time:Clipse:7:2003-02-15

Niggas and bitches
You are now listenin' to
The real
And that would be
Clipse, the Neptunes
And the new label
Star Trak

Top down, chrome spinnin'
You see the boss grinnin', I'm lovin' these damn women
I let two get in, she tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, "Naw love, that's forbidden"
I ain't for swishin', that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them twenty's real well

Now we coastin', me, two chicks and toastin'
I turn up the volume watch the bass get 'em open
Soft spoken with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they love it in the ride
We was movin' bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the D.J. started cuttin'
I was already fuckin'

Cinderella'd you girls from nothin' to somethin'
Hit the parkin' lot, hear the club system thumpin'
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P, I got new moves to make

When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you've arrived
From the club, to the park and ride
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie

Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy, we gets in for free
'Eh, they're with me'

Two steppin', you see each crew reppin'
Slippin' on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweatin'
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on

I like that ma, you do somethin' to me
Come this way and prove somethin' to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose

I'm open but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm totin'
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you've arrived
From the club, to the park and ride
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie

Yo, you are now listenin' to the sounds
That are vibratin' your speakers
Please do not be alarmed
It will not hurt you at all
For it is the real
For all my real
Niggas and bitches

When they say, "Last call," that don't mean the night's ovah
That means it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the cho cha

S and M chick, ass pushin' a choker
But I thought about how rich I am and said, "No sir!"
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What is it the "Whip Appeal" or my Babyface?

The night's still young and I'm already leanin'
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleamin'
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen

I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginnin'
She added to list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinnin' and my head spinnin'
Mine from juice and Ginin', hers from neck and chinin'
I'm a winner, man

When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you've arrived
From the club, to the park and ride
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie

When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you've arrived
From the club, to the park and ride
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie

Get down!
Get down!
Get down!
