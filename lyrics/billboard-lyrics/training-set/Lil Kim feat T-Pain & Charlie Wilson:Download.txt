"Download"
(feat. T-Pain and Charlie Wilson)

Shawty I been lookin at these pictures of you,
Cybersurfin
So when you gon' call me?
(flirtin)
When you gunna come thru?
(what's your fantasy?)
All I wanna do is download
When you gunna let me download?
Shawty up shawty down low
When you gunna let me download?

I'm on myspace and it's type late
My baby got me number one on his top eight
It's computer love
We don't mind to hate
They just myspace freaks tryna find a date
We up all night, havin cybersex
He chat, I chat though we neva met
He said he wanna explore me like tha internet
It's like a orgasm everytime he send a text
He wanna download
He likes to download
Lil Kim songs and put em on his ringtone
He even got my screen saver on his iphone
I get more hits than a t-inzone
We goin back and forth
Sendin emails
He a thug so I hit em' on his gmail
His sense of humor got me writin L-O-L
I sent pictures of myself straight to tha cell

Shawty I been lookin at these pictures of you,
Cybersurfin
So when you gun' call me?
When you gun' come thru?
All I wanna do is download
When you gun' let me download?
Shawty up shawty down low
When you gun' let me download?

He been lookin at my sexy pics
Said he diggin my sexy hips
He wanna kiss my sexy lips
And download me on his floppy disk
Lil Kim is the only one on his mind
He wanna come thru and put me on his hard drive
Three o'clock in the morning, we be online
Others send friend requests
But they get denied
He type I miss you
I type back to let him know the feelings mutual
It's just myspace love
But it's beautiful
He love to watch my videos on youtube
Hey, it's like everytime I log on
I get so turned on
Computer love playin in tha back
(thas ma song)
The only one that have me up all night long
Feel like a fantasy
Chemistry is so strong

Shawty I been lookin at these pictures of you,
Cybersurfin'
So when you gon' call me?
When you gon' come thru
All I wanna do is download
When you gon' let me download?
Shawty up shawty down low
When you gon' let me download?

I'm hopin you look like your pictures do
And when I see you
Up close and personal
So I can't touch you
Late night
Like an insomniac
I'm here now
Grab me where my hard drives at?
I meant what I said when I typed that
Lil mama scream my name if you like that
Ain't nothin like computer love

Shawty I been lookin at these pictures of you,
Cybersurfin'
So when you gon' call me?
When you gon' come thru
All I wanna do is download
When you gon' let me download?
Shawty up shawty down low
When you gon' let me download?

Screamin all night
Till we go sign out
Where we go from here?
Well we gun' find out
I gave him my number
I got his number
Thas how it is with computer love
If you a myspace freak thro it up one time
Come thru show a little love one time
Browsin for my friend
My baby's not around
So hit me up if you online right now

Shawty I been lookin at these pictures of you,
Cybersurfin'
So when you gun' call me?
When you gun' come thru
All I wanna do is download
When you gun' let me download?
Shawty up shawty down low
When you gunn' let me download?
