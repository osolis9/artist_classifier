Hate-Me-Now:NAS feat Puff Daddy:8:1999-05-22

Escobar Ceaser has returned

It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me, let's go

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
Do it now, do it now, do it now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
Bitches honeys that swollen, the riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ring side try watchin' my paper

Almost a decade quite impressive, most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for expanding more to the big screen
Bill Gates dreams but it seems you'd rather see me
In jail with state dreams
Want me off the scene fast but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch
Do it now

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
Do it now, I told you do it now, let's go

You wanna hate me then hate me, what can I do?
But keep gettin' money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up until I made it
Now y'all sayin' that's a clever nigga, nothing to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol' G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us

My bad, should I step out my shoes give 'em to you?
Here's my car and my house you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that what you expect hoe?
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that 'cause niggas feel this right

You think I'm gonna come this far
And let you niggas stop me now? I hate you too
Do it now

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
I like this, I like the way this feels, let's go

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates, I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, He blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop

And I side with the Lord, ride for the cause
While driving, niggas shot out my doors
Plottin, I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaw
Try stickin' my up but I but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess its just a theory of man became a monster, atop of the world
Never fallin', I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon

Hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
And that's what you can't understand

You can hate me now but I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now, you can hate me now
But I won't stop now 'cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now
C'mon niggas, you can hate me now but I won't stop now

It ain't gon never stop, niggas
