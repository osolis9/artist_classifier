Work hard, play hard

 Work hard, play hard

 Work, work, work, work

 [Verse 1]
 Diamonds all on my ring n*gga
 Gold watches, gold chain n*gga
 Hundred thou' on champagne n*gga
 Yeah my money insane n*gga
 Yeah I'm making it rain n*gga
 But I was just on the plane n*gga
 Buying gear, flying here
 F*ck what you heard, itâ€™s my time of year
 If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
 I'm always rolling up so I get love for that
 Them n*ggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
 My n*gga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that
 You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
 Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin' back
 My n*gga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
 So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
 Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink
 But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!

 [Hook (x2)]
 The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
 Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
 The quicker you here, the faster you go
 That's why where I come from the only thing we know is

 Work hard, play hard
 Work hard, play hard
 Work hard, play hard
 Work hard, play hard
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work

 [Verse 2]
 Hop your pretty ass up in this f*cking car
 B*tch I'm out this world, girl you know I'm a star
 Used to buying rounds but now we buy the bar
 Last year they had to ask now they know who we are
 Boss sh*t, walk in the building, I own sh*t
 You can tell by who I'm on the phone with
 Yeah n*gga talking about grown sh*t
 N*ggas too busy jacking my swag
 Need to f*ck around, get your own sh*t
 Get your own cars, get your own clothes
 Get your own smoke, get your own b*tch
 You ain't reppin' my gang, get your own clique

 [Hook (x2)]
 The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
 Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
 The quicker you here, the faster you go
 That's why where I come from the only thing we know is

 [Verse 3]
 Go hard
 Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do, that's your job
 And n*ggas gon' hate but that's no prob'
 So hey f*ck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
 Some n*ggas talking but the sh*t they claiming don't mean nothing
 It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG
 And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me
 Most n*ggas don't see

 The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
 Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
 The quicker you here, the faster you go

 Work hard, play hard
