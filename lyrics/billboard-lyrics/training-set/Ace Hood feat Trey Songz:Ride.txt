Ride:Ace Hood feat Trey Songz:14:2008-10-18

Chyeah, Ace Hood
See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me
I want you to be my ride or die
While I go get this money, I promise I'ma get us out the hood baby

Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
And when I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride or die we gon' make it out this hood

Listen, baby look, just ride with me
Swear that I got us mama
One thing I love about it
See you ain't wit that drama

You be my ride or die like Bonnie I'mma play the Clyde
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house
That's why you never trip I'm grindin' bump a 9-5
Gotta get this money, paper callin' but you never whine
Gotta ask the cash come with bags you should see your eyes
That's why I surprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind

Cuz when I'm gone lil' mama home alone at every time
You never blowed my phone up yet cuz you respect the grind
And you never holla 'bout a problem keep it on the line
My gutta baby, never maybe always gonna ride

Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
And when I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride or die we gon' make it out this hood

And um, we can do them long vacations, thinking Jamaica lately
Can't take them deep relations, baby just keep it patient
Shawty know what I do, Shawty know who I be
You know I'm in these streets the only way that we gon' eat

I keep it gutta never cut her when we in them sheets
I get some cutta grab the duffle then I'm in the streets
Come back with bundles pimp a half a g and Louis V
But you ain't trippin' never question bout a nigga g

We keep it real ain't no other that could fill ya sneak's
I ride for you, you ride for me that's where we need to be
I hold you down, you hold me down and I fulfill your dreams
Your my Beyonce, I'm Hova, won't you ride with me?

Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
And when I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride or die we gon' make it out this hood

Now what's the definition of a rider?
Through it all they gon' stand right beside ya
If you got one look em in the eyes
Tell em you gon' ride

Tell em you gon' ride, ride, ride
Till the wheel fall off or the day that I die
That's on my life ain't nun wrong wit tryna love somebody
Tryna tell you shawty that

Ace, chyeah, and I promise this to you, I'mma get us out the hood
Into them places that you thinkin' that you never could
But you gotta ride like them tires on the mini coop
I'mma get this cash paper bags and give half to you

Forget them haters, keep you tailored see what's sexydo
And I like your body all I think about is doin' you
And I love the money so I guess it's like doin' two
You ride or die same smile when you see the loot

Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
And when I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride or die we gon' make it out this hood

Yea, yea, yea, we gon' make it out
We gon' make it out this hood
