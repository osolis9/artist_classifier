I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high on your memory
High on your memory
High on your memory
I get high, high, high, high (everyday)
I get high, high, high, high (every night)
I get high, high, high, high (all the time)

Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S-P, the only flowa that you know with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I can roll up, hop in the whip, and like bounce to the Ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
And take a blunt just to ease the pain that humbles me now
And I'd rather roll something up
Cause if I'm sober dog, I just might flip, grab my guns and hold something up
I get high as a kite, I'm in the zone, all alone, motha fucka case I'm dyin tonight
So I roll em up, back to back, fat as I could
You got beef with south P, I come strapped with the hood

I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high on your memory
High on your memory
High on your memory
I get high, high, high, high (everyday)
I get high, high, high, high (every night)
I get high, high, high, high (all the time)

Ay yo, I smoke like a chiminey
Matter fact I - smoke like a gun when a killa see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did
After that, then I smoke like the hippies did, back in the seventies
Spit with the finishing touch, get this that
Ima finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when - bullets hit faces after words exchange
I get a rush off the blood on the walls
You understand, like the S-5 pedal when its touchin the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do
And Ima never give a fuck, cause I'm better than you

I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high, (I get high)
I get high on your memory
High on your memory
High on your memory
I get high, high, high, high (everyday)
I get high, high, high, high (every night)
I get high, high, high, high (all the time)

Im'a smoke 'till my lungs collapse
I'm from the era where, niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where the dollar bill is powerful
I smoke weed cause time seem precious and I know what an hour do
I get high for a livin, gots to ride for a livin
With my bill Gates the niggas that'll die for a livin
Shit I get as high as I could
Cause if you see things, like I see things, Ima die in the hood
Motha fucka understand its full service for you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you can name any rapper, if you want it die
This is s-p dumpin and bitch I get high

I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
I Get High, high, high, high
Highhhh
