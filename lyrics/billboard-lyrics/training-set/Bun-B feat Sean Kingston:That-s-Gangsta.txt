That-s-Gangsta:Bun-B feat Sean Kingston:16:2008-06-14

I'm a full time hustla posted on the block
Got to get it to live and I'm never going to stop
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta
When me ride through the hood you can hear the bass knock
All me girls them love me, me, have me city locked
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta

Mane, I'm a gangsta, G A N G S T A, mane
A gangsta, the best to come up out of PA, mane
A gangsta seldom seen but always heard
A real gangsta more than just a 7 letter word

A gangsta ain't ya clothes, a gangsta ain't ya hat
Your watch, ring, your chain naw a gangsta ain't that
A gangsta can have that but he ain't got to show it
'Cause with or without it he's still gangsta and you know it

From my head to my toe with it, it ain't to hard to see
Said I'm a gangsta, ain't too many as hard as me
You claiming G but you ain't gangsta jack
So tell all them fake gangstas I'm coming to take gangsta back.

Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta
When me ride through the hood you can hear the bass knock
All me girls them love me, me, have me city locked
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta

Mane, I'm a gangsta now, let me tell you what that means
See I'm a gangsta, always got my mind on my green
And I'm a gangsta, always gon' do what I got to do
Unless it's giving game to police and selling out his crew

That's something gangstas don't do, a gangsta keep it trill
A gangsta do a crime, he do his time on the real
A gangsta don't squeal and tell on everyone he know
Put a jacket on ya, boy, you ain't a gangsta you's a hoe

A gangsta hold his homeboys down when they gone
A gangsta put him back on his feet when he home
A gangsta is a homeboy that never turn his back
On another real homie, that's a well known fact

Got to get it to live and I'm never going to stop
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta
When me ride through the hood you can hear the bass knock
All me girls them love me, me, have me city locked
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta

Mane, I'm a gangsta, call me the hood superstar
And I'm a gangsta riding in my candy painted car
'Cause see a gangsta always down to rep for his hood
And to do a little bad so I can do a little good

A gangsta don't forget where he came from
No matter where he go or where he been, keep it gangsta till the end
'Cause I'm a gangsta and I'm a always love my city
Make money but don't act like I'm above my city

'Cause gangstas will always give back to the ghetto
And gangstas will never turn their back to the ghetto
That's a fact in the ghetto, it's never been a lie
So I'm a keep it, gangsta till the day that I die

Got to get it to live and I'm never going to stop
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta
When me ride through the hood you can hear the bass knock
All me girls them love me, me, have me city locked
Now that's gangsta, now that's gangsta
