All-I-Need:Fat Joe feat Tony Sunshine & Armageddon:21:2003-04-05

Cool an' Dre, who you gon' trust?
Yeah, you could trust me

I don't care about nothin' else, my baby
All I care is about bein' here for you
An' I won't stare at nobody else, my baby
'Coz all I need is you

What you think gangstas don't cry an' get hurt by lies?
Times you embarrassed me, I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of tellin' you I got nothin' to hide
I'm in the studio at night, you think I'm out with the guys

Every time I speak to you, you got somethin' to say
Accordin' to you, Imma speed crushin' all day
All I'm askin' you for is to be more trustin'
I'm outta town all the time an' don't accuse you of nothin'

Picture me creepin' with a chick on tour
When you love my sons as if they was yours
I know at times you feel alone 'coz I'm not home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone

To reassure you my love is more than a scene
I adore you, my wife, my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray, I'm on it everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose, hey

I don't care about nothin' else, my baby
All I care is about bein' here for you
An' I won't stare at nobody else, my baby
'Coz all I need is you

Yeah, how I'm supposed to start this?
First an' first, you my queen goddess
My moon, my earth, the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to God, it amazes me how you stay in college
An' still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone

An' tourin', makin' dollars
Assumin' that you know that I love you but regardless
I feel it's time I showed you, bless you with this ring
Now that's somethin' to hold you down 'til a nigga come back

Me an' my lady got history, she's worth an' deserves
More then this cold world is givin' me to share with her word
An' I don't care about nothin' else except my girl
Not myself, no one else, just my girl

You bring life to my world, you give me strength to go on
An' face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled 'My Wife' but you truly exceed the title
You my future, my happiness, my heart, my idol
I promise, girl that

I don't care about nothin' else, my baby
All I care is about bein' here for you
An' I won't stare at nobody else, my baby
'Coz all I need is you, 'coz all I need is you
'Coz all I need is you

To all the ladies out there, if you love your man
You need to hold your man, embrace your man
An' just grab his hand, repeat after me
I promise to stay true an' give you all of me

Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether he's out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man an' respect that man
An' you get what you feel you deserve from that man

An' 'coz I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times an' bad times
You will always, always be my girl

I don't care about nothin' else, my baby
All I care is about bein' here for you
An' I won't stare at nobody else, my baby
'Coz all I need is you

I don't care about nothin' else, my baby
All I care is about bein' here for you
An' I won't stare at nobody else, my baby
'Coz all I need is you, 'coz all I need is you
'Coz all I need is you, 'coz all I need is you
