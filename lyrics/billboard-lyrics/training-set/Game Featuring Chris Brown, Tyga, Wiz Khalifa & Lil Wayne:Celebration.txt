[Verse 1 - Game]
Nigga blowing on that L, breakin’ down them trees
I’m out the door with that dro on the keys
Scooping up drank and I’m hitting the freeway
Yeah, got a whole sip of that purp
Got a couple hoes home with no clothes on
Cause they roll on us, twerk
And we hot boxed in that Ghost, Ace all in that door
Ray Bans on my face, never know when my eyes low
Smoke good, fuck good, eat good, Steakhouse
She said Backwoods, kill swishers, blue E, take out
Yeah, but I love fuckin’ them redbones
She country thick and that hair long
That pussy killer, she dead wrong
She went to Howard, her head strong
Her momma taught her, her legs long
She went to college and got a masters
Now she bringing that bread home
Roll up…

[Bridge - Chris Brown & (Tyga)]
Put the purp in the blunt
(Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high)
Put the purp in the blunt
(Westside, westside, westside, westside, westside)

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]
It’s a celebration on that pole doing the dance
Anticipating I’m feeling your body
Hoping that you would just give me a chance
God damn B, just hold your glass up for this toast
My cash up and your ass up, and I’m the one tippin’ the most
Tonight, oh you outside?
And if you wanna roll, have the best fuckin’ night of your life
No lie, no lie
Me and you together girl, I’m celebrating you tonight

[Verse 3 - Tyga]
Uh, yeah I’m blown, no cigarillo rello
Loving like Mello, get on my level, 101 carats in my bezel
I’m on like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble soon as I ask shawty her number, fo’ sho’
Yeah I get it then I’m gone, then I hit it like bone-bone
Now you fucking up my zone, my zone, my zone
Said she wait for daddy come home
Told me she ain’t got nothing on
I’m talking no thong, th-thong, thong
Yeah she throwing that ass back
Hard as a back, sit on my lap
Fuckin’ with me, nothing better than that
That’s a fact, that’s a fact
Don’t act Hollywood cause I don’t act
‘Bout my business but I don’t slack
This my celebration rap so…

[Chorus - Chris Brown]
We havin’ a celebration, love to stay high
We havin’ a celebration, love to stay high
We havin’ a celebration, love to stay high
We havin’ a celebration, love to stay high

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
Uh, I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter with the rest of the bowling pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch I got road rage
Got the Kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silence on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up
I’m going at your face, make up
These niggas need stitches cause they taking pay cuts
Man somebody tell them hoes it’s a celebration
All my niggas got guns, no registration, yeah
Now go and light that weed up, I’m TRUKFIT tee’d up
Hoes down, B’s up, Tunechi

[Verse 5 - Wiz Khalifa]
Rollin’ and chokin’, I’m movin’ in slow motion, I’m pulling on good
Rollin’ and chokin’, I’m movin’ in slow motion, I’m pulling on good
[Bridge - Chris Brown & (Lil Wayne)]
