My-Place:Nelly feat Jaheim:2:2004-11-20

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering?
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing

From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
It's all his fault again that's what you tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again

See how ya day going I know they stressin' on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for ya, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me, oh girl?
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl?
We gon' do it our way, our way

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time

We never had a problem with gettin' it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but sex wouldn't one
Now check it I know you get excited when I come around and bite it
Quit frownin' up and quit actin' like you don't like it

I like it, I like it
I really, really like it
I want it, adore it
So come with me enjoy it

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me, oh girl?
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl?
We gon' do it our way, our way

Shorty, where you been?
Feels like a long time, long long time since I seen ya, yes it has girl
Well, I know I said some fucked up things to you before
But girl, you know I didn't mean it, I never meant one single word

If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you believe it
Hey girl
'Cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me, oh girl?
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl?
We gon' do it our way, our way

I like it, I like it
I really, really like it
I want it, adore it
So come with me enjoy it

I like it, I like it
I really, really like it
I want it, adore it
So come with me enjoy it
When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever
When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one it's forever, it's forever
Shorty, where you been?
Feels like a long time, long long time since I seen ya, yes it has girl
Well, I know I said some fucked up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it, I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
