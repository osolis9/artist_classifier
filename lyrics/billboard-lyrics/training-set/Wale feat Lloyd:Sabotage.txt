Sabotage:Wale feat Lloyd:16:2012-05-19

It’s important to go right into the booth after the arguing
I think it’s only right, hoarse and everything
Like fuck it though, what’s up

Pessimism is all that she know
Cause every brother she go with always pick up and go
I been trying to show you somethin, got a different approach
Told her, “Give me your heart; try to get you the globe”
Have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it
Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves
We go together / break up
We go together / break up
Ain’t this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up
When we good, we good shawty
We don’t ever make love
But if I call out your name, I bet your ready to “uh!”
You say you ready, you ain’t ready enough
Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up
This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit
She the shit, She the one
She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done
This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit
She the shit, She the one
She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done

Cause I, am feeling this deep down in my heart
I’m feeling like I never want to be apart
But just when it gets good, she’s gone
And I’m left right back at start..

My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah
She can only take so much more than her heart got
She can only live for the moment
Why? I’ll never know it
Guess I’ll meet her right back at start

Let’s roll a J and pretend we in love
I’ve got a paper plane, it’s propelling my buzz
I’m trying to make a way, she never call back
She’s tryna fall back, cuz she say I’m all that
She only love me when I be ignoring
When I be doing throwin it on her, shorty brushing me off
I swear, I kinda feel like she’s slightly bizarre
Sabotage all the time, have me Avatar’d
Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only cause I stick around
She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about
Yea and this is something to think about
Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse
Ha, that make it hard to be faithful
Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more
Tell more depending on where Wale going
Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long
It’s weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong
You gon’ miss a good thing and bitter alone
Shit ain’t better alone
I get her once I bet you keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for…

My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah
She can only take so much more than her heart got
She can only live for the moment
Why? I’ll never know it
Guess I’ll meet her right back at start

This is her, this is it
This is sabotage love, counterfeit
She the shit, She the one
She need now, She ain’t never needed love
Gotta go, let her leave
This is something that could never ever be
Said her hearts, in a cage
Cuz if you never love, you can never hate
Marinate

Sabotage, sabotage, I love you
Sabotage, sabotage, I love you
Sabotage, I love how you keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more

My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah
She can only take so much more than her heart got
She can only live for the moment
Why? I’ll never know it
Guess I’ll meet her right back at start

My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah
She can only take so much more than her heart got
She can only live for the moment
