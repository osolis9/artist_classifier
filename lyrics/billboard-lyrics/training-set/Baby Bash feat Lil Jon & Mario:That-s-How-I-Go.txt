That-s-How-I-Go:Baby Bash feat Lil Jon & Mario:17:2009-04-04

That's how I go
That's how I go
That's how I go
How I go how I go

I let the roof drop
Drippin' candy with super baby
In my new car
And I'm glad that she love to have me
Im like ooh Lord
From Jamaica to Puerto Rico down to Utah
From Miami to California they some cool broads
Haters tell me they can't be mad at my new job
We be goin' hard in the bank like a hoop star
Its finger li- lickin' good like a full course
Give it to ya girl don't have to tell you baby
You start if you like it you know I love it
Baby, 2 more
And the smell of that new Chanel girl, it never fail
We can fly away or just drive
Baby, heads or tails?
And oh yeah, and oh yeah

Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
Sometimes I party like crazy showin love to the girls
Thats how I go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
I go and go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
And then my pockets look gravy with plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and the key to my crib
Thats how I go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
I go and go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl

I said man girl you think its 5 o'clock traffic on that 101
Maybe later on tonight me and you can have ourselves a 1 on 1
I swear I've seen you somewhere else
Maybe it was on a movie screen
Maybe it was on a television
Or on the cover of a magazine
I know and I don't care
Let me see your underwear
Let me see how thick you is baby
Let me see whats under there
Everybody know we go go go go oh so fast when im on my grind
But I can't lie when I see that ass
I slow it down and take my time

Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
Sometimes I party like crazy showin love to the girls
Thats how I go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
I go and go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
And then my pockets look gravy with plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and the key to my crib
Thats how I go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
I go and go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl

Girl I gotta red eye flight, soundcheck, another photo shoot
Girl I gotta go I gotta do another interview
Studio tonight have a banger you could listen to
Baby you ain't even gotta ask
You know I'm missin' you
The money keep comin girl, cause we keep goin
Yeah we go and go and go and go and go and keep goin
Yeah the money keep comin girl, cause we keep goin
Yeah we go and go and go and go and go and keep goin

Said I met a lot of ladies and I travel the world
Sometimes I party like crazy showin love to the girls
Thats how I go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
I go and go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
And then my pockets look gravy with plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and the key to my crib
Thats how I go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl
I go and go, thats how I go girl, thats how I go girl

Thats how we go.
