Give-Me-Everything:Pitbull feat Ne-Yo, Afrojack & Nayer:4:2011-07-09

Me not working hard?
Yea right picture that with a Kodak
And better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
And I just want y’all know that
And tonight, let’s enjoy life

Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let’s do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All my girls they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (Let'e do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to say
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Get busy tonight
Cuz to more and more to
Do bad before and for Prius
Desperate tonight
I can make you my queen
And make love to you eanless
This is insane, the way the name growin',
Money keep flowin'
Hustlers move aside, so I'm tiptoein,
Keep flowin'
I gotta locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my life baby
I can make you feel right baby
I can't promise tomorrow but I promise tonight.
Dale

Excuse me
But I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And maybe I'm a meke you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All my girls they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (Let'e do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to say
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Reach for the stars and if you don't grab 'em,
At least you're on top of the world
Think about it cuz if you slip I'm gonna fall
On top of you girl put on 'em ball whe they sleep
at the Macy's and it ain't no secret
My granny's from Cuba but I'm an American
Tied over money like Seacrest.
Put it on my life baby I can make you feel right baby
I can't promise tomorrow but I promise tonight.
Dale

Excuse me
But I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And maybe I'm a meke you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All my girls they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (Let'e do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to say
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Excuse me
But I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And maybe I'm a meke you feel so good tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow...
