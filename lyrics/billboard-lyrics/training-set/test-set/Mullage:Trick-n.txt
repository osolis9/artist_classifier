You don't even have to ask.

Cause I can make it rain on you
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got(trickin trickin) if you got it
Everybody know it ain't trickin if you got it.
Trickin if you got(trickin trickin) if you got it.
Everybody know it ain't trickin if you got it.
I'm a pilot, I walk on through a profit
And everybody know it ain't trickin if you got it
I'm diggin in my pocket while I'm sippin this bacardy
Might throw a couple dollaz
Hell planty if ya smilin
Twistin on ya body but I really ain't decided
Just feel as tho I gota cause it really ain't an option
I'm scopin at your body while your bendin over poppin
Like damn don't stop it let me go back in my wallet
Yes, she so definet
The way her body move I can't help but stop and stare
Pull a stack up out my pocket
And say can I touch you there
Without no underwear
Think the opposite they pair

Slap them on in da mornin
I love how your performin
The more I made it ring
Her body organs kept on stormin
Go on stroke it from the center
Body quivers I deliver
Let me put you with a tip
I ain't second to remember
If you down for whatever tonight
Honey You can have whatever you like
And you don't gotta settle tonight
It don't get no better tonight
Lil mama yeah she just my type
I've been waitin for this all my life
C'mon baby let's take flight(so high)
Takin off tonight
Dat shawty she caught my eye
Like a Bently on the night
Feel like I'm on the ride
So I'm trickin on the spot
Listen to me while I speak this pimpin on the rocks
Let's kick it up a notch lil mama whatcha got
I been checkin this one out
I love her dirty mouth
She say o you really spendin me benj-ez you talkin bout
C'mon and take this route
This money you can't ignore
