Sunshine:Lil' Flip feat Lea:2:2004-10-30

Yeeah
(Ooh baby)
Lil' Flipper
(Ooh baby)
My girl Lea

Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player
But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
'Coz I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball

I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile

I need a lady on the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook 'coz a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

I know your friends wanna holla 'coz I got them dollars
Push the Maybach Monday, Tuesday Impala
I switch whips like kicks, I'm a balla
And if I get your phone number, I'm a call ya

And we can meet up the next day and chill
But I'm always on the road baby girl, that's how I live
I got bills to pay, I got moves to make
But when my plane touch down, pick me up at eight, don't be late

Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

We don't have to be in love, we can just be friends
I will be right there, beginning to the end
I can bring my girls, you can bring your friends
We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end

They say love is pain and pain is love
I know ya momma mad 'coz you talk to a thug
You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue
About what a real nigga like me do

I like to stack my bread and flip my chips
And I can change ya life if ya get wit Flip
I take private jets to Vegas, man
It's twenty bread each pick 'coz I'm major man

We can cruise the world in a Bentley Azure
But don't worry, the chauffeur open the door
You couldn't ask for more 'coz we got it all
'Coz you my baby girl right? Right?

Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

We don't have to be in love
We don't have to be in love
