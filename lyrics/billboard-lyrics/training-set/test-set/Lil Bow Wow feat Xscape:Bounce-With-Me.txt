Bounce-With-Me:Lil Bow Wow feat Xscape:1:2001-01-13

See around here
I make things that make y'all bounce
Ya know?
Ya know what I mean?
Left to right, right to left
It's so so def
And uh it's goin' down
Ya know what I mean?
My man bow wow
Bow wow, yeah hear me now
Yeah ya heard?
Let's go, let's go, let's go

Around here we pop them collars
Around here we get them dollars
Every girl I see that look right
A nigga like me just gotta holla
This kid here all about stackin' up
Got big head but we can back it up
Long 'cause everybody get crunk
When we drop in the club starts acting up
I represent the s o s o, d e f m o b
That's me, J D, da brat, and J E
So please believe
What I do ain't never been done
Ohio is where I'm from
I heard what you said
And I saw what you do
And y'all playas really don't want none
From the day to the night, I rock
Say what you like, never not
Stayin' alive, living the life
Gots to keep it hot
Shotgun in the drop
Riding good, twenties, TV's, leather and wood
Poppin', watching big momma
Holdin' it down like a playa should
Sing a long now

All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

It's the B to the O W
Wow even your girl fall in love
When I smile
The tight little guy you ain't seen in a while
Ignore the hype, just right for you size
I get in where I fit in
Braided up, made the bucks
And I'm still a kid
Imagine what life like when I get big
I'm ma be rich surrounded by chicks
Couple of cars, couple of cribs
Gettin' a couple of mills
Shining every time I feel
You see how so so get ill
You don't want no stuff up in here
Bow to the wow, in your ear now
I get down 'cause I'm hit bound
And I rock an iced out Mickey Mouse around my neck
And I hang on niggas like Vince Carter
With my arm in the net
And I outta snatch up your daughters
But I was brought up with respect
When I turn sixteen I'm ma call her though
And show her how to ride with a baller yo
Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her
To fall in love with a nigga like me along time ago
Sing a long now

All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me

I, I, I wanna see you bounce with me now
Take, take, take it down to the ground with me now
Shake, shake, shake it all around the town with me now
What'cha gon do shorty, what'cha gon do
