Tell-Me:Diddy feat Christina Aguilera:14:2007-02-03

Can you feel me?
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Do that shit, do that shit, do it
Tell me
What you thinking about when you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you that really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak
Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning
I don't even know your name(name)
Boy, I need to know your name(name)
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it
I know you're gonna like it(I know)
So tell me how you want it(Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it(You know)
‘Cause baby you're invited, yeah
I know you're gonna like it(I know)
So tell me how you want it(Tell me)
And you don't have to fight it(You know)
‘Cause baby you're invited
Your dreams fulfilled, you're rocking with the best
Unforgivable I'ma put your limits to the test
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, you're trying to catch your breath(Don't stop)
