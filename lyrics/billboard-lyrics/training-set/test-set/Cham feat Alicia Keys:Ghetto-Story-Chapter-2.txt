Ghetto-Story-Chapter-2:Cham feat Alicia Keys:13:2006-11-04

Here's my ghetto story
Been in hell, through the fire
Now gonna take it higher
Here's my survival story
So many reasons to sing this
Now we got the keys to the kingdom

I remember those days when hell was my home
When me and mama bed was a big piece of foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When mama gone a work me go street go roam

I remember when Danny dem take me snow cone
And make him licke bredda dem kick up Jerome
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome

I remember when we run fatta get him knee blown
And mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome
I remember so the Avenue tun inna war zone
An Mickey madda fly him out 'cuz she get a loan

But, Mickey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
Mek whole heap a money and seen in our own
Now a we a lock the city and that is well known
Yesterday Mikey call me pan mi phone, me say Mikey

We get da kingdom, dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a don't know
We have whole heap a extra clip 'cause we nuh broke no
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

We got the kingdom so we have to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top, baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

I remember those days when we was dead broke
And I could barely find a dollar for a token
Hop in the train just to get where I'm going
Hobos after me and runnin' like I'm smokin'

Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny

I remember playin' over needles in the streets
Everywhere I go, a man want some part of me
Dirty, dirty those hookas and hoes on 11th Avenue
Sellin' bodies for dough

Remember cryin' sayin' that will never be me
Gonna make it someday, gotta be somebody
Say mommy, donâ€™t worry, it's just you and me
But one day we will get out of this misery, hey

We get da kingdom, dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a don't know
We have whole heap a extra clip 'cause we nuh broke no
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

We got the kingdom so we have to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top, baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Here's my ghetto story
Been in hell through the fire
Now gonna take it higher
Here's my survival story
So many reasons to sing this
Now we got the keys to the kingdom

Jamaica get screw tru greed and glutton
Politics manipulate and press yutes button
But we rich now so dem can tell man notin'
'Cuz a we a mek mama a nyaam fish and mutton, hey

Ova dehso mek mi tell unnu somethin'
Tru mi dey a foreign now a guy kill me cousin
An mi here sey TD deh dey but him say he wasn't
Anytime mi fly down him a get 'bout dozen, 'cause

We get da kingdom, dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a don't know
We have whole heap a extra clip 'cause we nuh broke no
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

We got the kingdom so we have to make way
We take it from the bottom to the top, baby
And now the whole community can live greatly
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah
