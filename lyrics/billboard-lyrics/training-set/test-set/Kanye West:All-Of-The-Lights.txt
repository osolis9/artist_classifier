All-Of-The-Lights:Kanye West:2:2011-07-09

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights

Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
All of the lights

If you want it you can get it
For the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it
For the rest of your life

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread

I'm headed home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take 'em to that ghetto university

All of the lights, cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, streetlights, all of the lights
All of the lights, fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life, every night, all of the lights

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights

Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive

I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts suck me dry, I spent that bread
She need a daddy , baby please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

All of the lights, cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, streetlights, all of the lights
All of the lights, fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life, every night, all of the lights

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights

Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, hey
You should go and get your own

Getting mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, hey
You should go and get your own

Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time

We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We're going all the way this time

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything, want you to see all of the lights

I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh
I tried to tell you but all I could say is, oh, oh
