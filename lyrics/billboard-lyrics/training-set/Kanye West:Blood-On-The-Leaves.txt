Blood-On-The-Leaves:Kanye West:21:2013-09-14

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just wanna clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
And I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah and I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty
So let's get on with it

[Hook 1]
You could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
It came out of your body
It came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore yah
Before the love life stole yah
Remember we were so young
When I would hold yah
Before the glory
I know there ain't wrong with me

[Bridge]
Something strange is happening

[Hook 2]
You could've been somethin'
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
It came out of our body
It came out of our body

[Verse 2]
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know yah
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
I'll ride for my niggas, I'll die for my niggas

[Verse 3]
To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you call me crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant ain't it
That's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
Or that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony
Yeah, yeah she got you homey
'Til death but do your part
Unholy matrimony
