Want-It-Need-It:Plies feat Ashanti:13:2009-04-18

I never knew you felt like that baby
Never knew you felt like that
Pleasure's all mine

Oh, boy I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it
You know I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it, hey

I think it's so cute how you use me
Whenever you want sex I'm who you come and see
I'm the one you call when ya body on E
You need a refill I'm who you come see

They give you eighty seven, I give you ninety three
Premium top of the line, straight deep
Say it again in my ear, Plies you a beast
How could one this gutta be so sweet

Whatever you need, baby it's my treat
All I want from you is to let me go deep
I'm on call for you seven days a week
Sex on delivery, S.O.D

Oh, boy I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it
You know I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it, hey

When she think about me she get so wet
Every time she want it she send me a text
Do I want it tonight? Baby yes
Between her legs, she is so blessed

She is the best thing in the bed that I met
You need a good jug be my guest
Whatever you want I'm at your request
Until I get to you baby I can't rest

All I can think about is feelin' your sweat
Playin' in your hair and feelin' your flesh
Watchin' you as you undress
I'm your goon, you my goonette

Oh, boy I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it
You know I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it, hey

I'm sleepin', I feel your hand in my boxers
Baby, it's five in the mornin', you rubbin' on Oscar
Know if you wake him up it's gon' be problems
I know you playin' with what you want so I won't stop you

Jus' let me open my eyes so I can watch it
You want a dose of your medicine you wanna see the doctor
Gon' take 'em off so I can go and lock ya
I call you momma, you call me poppa

I wanna make you tonight my baby mama
Scent like water, mean no aroma
Come a lil' closer so I can put it on ya
You my property I'm your owner

Oh, boy I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it
You know I think of you on two occasions
That's when I want it, that's when I want it
That's when I need it, that's when I need it, hey
