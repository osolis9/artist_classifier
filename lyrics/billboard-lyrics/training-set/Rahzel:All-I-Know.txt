All-I-Know:Rahzel:10:1999-08-28

And now Ladies and Gentlemen in your right corner
Weighing in at an even two hundred and fifteen pounds
Residing from the South Bronx
Maintaining thirty nine wins, forty knockouts and no losses
It's the undisputed beat box champion of the world

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

When I first came out many couldn't catch my name
Now worldwide, feel the affects, scratch my name
Rahzel, now rewind that, slow it down, you'll find that
The way I design that and reverb behind that, not in my contract

I'm bustin' all over this bitch, while your girl cums
Down with the two-one-fifth, Illadelph, Dy-Nast'
R Double O, T S, no need to remind us
You're far behind us, tryin' to high beam, blind us

You're catching shinas from a nickel plated niner
Blastin' holes in your designers
This is for you primadonnas
'Cause my persona's like piranhas

I got you second guessin' and sweatin' like saunas
If you learned from the second lesson, no question you want it
Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer
God damn it feel good to see people up on it

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

Who's the man, Rahzel's the man so yo pass the method
1200 styles, crush your crew without no effort
Let me flip my, vocabulary, vocal acrobatics
Smack up phone dramatics, I can jam like automatics

Nine millimeter, twelve rounds, one in the chamber
Russian Roulette, you can bet, there is danger
Number five in the Billboard, with the bullet
One million, in my pile, you know the style, let me pull it

'Cause I'm about to blast ya, take the mic, then harass ya
Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya
Nineteen-ninety-nine, octane, because I gassed ya
Watch me George Jet, on-you-son, like I'm Nasa

God damn, like to compare on blaster
It's the sound affect master
And I'll destroy anyone, who dares go against me

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

I got your mouth wide open, just like the Grand Canyon
I'm Trugoy, to this rap game, I got game
Call me Denzel, with the rap name, I got aim
He's on fire like a coal in a hot flame

Plus my Posdonuses, produces, your prognosis
Kids doin' the chronic from coast to coast kid
Death what the doctor ordered, so say, ah
Take you three feet high and Risin' like De La, c'est la vie

I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my L P
Check the outlets for cassettes and C D
Sam Goody, blockbustin' up your H M V

Nigga please, ask yo mama for some cheese
Tell her you need some restitution like them Vietnamese
In Vietnam, 'cause Rahel drops the bomb
More complex than texts, in your Holy Qu'ran

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
