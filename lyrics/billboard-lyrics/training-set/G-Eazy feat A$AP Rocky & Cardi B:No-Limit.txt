No-Limit:G-Eazy feat A$AP Rocky & Cardi B:10:2017-11-18

If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance
Turn this shit into a nightclub

Fuck with me and get some money, yeah ayy
Fuck with me and get some money (ayy)
Fuck with me and get some money (ayy)
Fuck with G and get some money

No limit I'm a fucking soldier, ayy
Always lit, yeah I'm never sober
It's been three days in a row, your bitch coming over
Told that bitch to kick rock, she act like it's a boulder, ayy
'Rari, shopping
Let me, cop it
Always, poppin'
Hella, poppin'
She's a bopper
Homie, hoppin'
Ain't no, stopping
Album, dropping
Got the city on fire
Bitch lying on me like she tired
I might have to fuck around and call Kamaiyah
Hoe stirring up the pot, Jambalaya
Young Gerald

If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance
Turn this shit into a nightclub

Fuck him then I get some money
Fuck him then I get some money
Fuck him then I get some money
Fuck him then I get some money

I need tongue
I need space
Give me brain, concentrate
I go foam, product case
Kill a weave, rock a lace
Fuck the Moe
Buy the ACE
Fuck the Golds
Drive a Wraith
Get some money, fuck the rollie
Fuck the rollie, patty cakes
My career takin' off
These hoes jogging in place
Swear these hoes run they mouth
How these hoes out of shape?
Can you stop with all the subs?
Bitch I ain't Jared
If you really want some smoke
You can pull up, you can get it
Grab a hand full of braids, make a nigga eat me out
Put a white boy on Sazón
I might turn G-Eazy out
Keep it G from the club ‘til the end, from the spot
You know me, Cardi B
Pussy poppin' on the charts

If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance
Turn this shit into a nightclub

Fuck with me and get some money, yeah ayy
Fuck with me and get some money (ayy)
Fuck with me and get some money (ayy)
Fuck with G and get some money

It ain't nice fam
You can study where I'm from on my Viceland
This is nothing new to me, this my life fam
I can pull a million girls from a mic stand
Pull one at my show 'cause I like fans
Later on I got two in my night plans
Man, this year I had three hundred one night stands
Keep a Costco pack of rubbers in my night stand
Damn Daniel, back again with the–
Saint-Laurent, aye they send me product, it's retarded
Aye, this was free
Bitch, you bought it
Bitch, you on my dick
Bitch, get off it

If I hit it one time I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
It ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up
Nigga pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe
In your face, what'd you say?
Money, dance
Turn this shit into a nightclub

Fuck with me and get some money, Hey
Fuck with me and get some money (ayy)
Fuck with me and get some money (ayy)
Fuck with G and get some money
