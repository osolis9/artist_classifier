(Yeahh)â€¦ doing a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop
Ha haâ€¦ she got me thinking I can date a cop
Ha haâ€¦ cause her uniform pants are so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in a car, she cut off all the lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren
Talkinâ€™ boutâ€¦
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea
And I know she the law and she know Iâ€™m the boss
And she know I get high a-bove the law
And she know Iâ€™m raw, she know it from the street
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
Talkinâ€™ boutâ€¦
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee)
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea

Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya
Iâ€™m Kidd Kiddâ€¦ my face on every wanted poster
Iâ€™m wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold ya
Hands so big you thought I told ya to pull it over
She pulled me overâ€¦ pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closerâ€¦ do me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off

Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you canâ€™t finish your shift
Cause itâ€™s onâ€¦ tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head
And I canâ€™t wait to get it on
Wanna do it all night longâ€¦ Mrs. Officer
