[Paul Wall]

Its da ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth lookin somethin like a disco ball
I got da diamonds and da ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin on aluminum foil
Smilin' showin off my diamonds sippin on some potin oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carrots 30 stacks let em know I'm so fo real
My motivation is from 30 pointers V VS the furniture my mouth
piece simply symbolize success
I got da wrist wear and neck wear dats captivatin
But its my smile dats got these on-lookers spectatin
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see mo carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin givin everybody chillz
Call me George Foreman cuz I'm sellin everybody grillz

[Chorus]
Smile fo me daddy
(What you lookin at)
Let me see ya grill
(Let ya see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Rob da jewelry store and tell em make me a grill)
(She said) smile fo me daddy
(What you lookin at)
I want to see your grill
(You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
(Had a whole top diamond and da bottom rows gold)

You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a fruit loop box

[Ali]

Where I got em you can spot them
On da top in da bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

[Gipp]

Yeah deez hos can't focus cuz they eyesight blurry
Tippin on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelyy

[Ali]

(Had a whole top diamonds and da bottom rows gold)
