Smile:Scarface feat 2Pac & Johnny P:2:1997-09-27

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see that's gon' make it hard
To smile in the future but through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain, you gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that, yeah, keep ya head up, yeah

Our lifestyles be close captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail and crack sales

Hustlin' at heart be a nigga's culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures

Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve, just look at me

Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less but you still precious, just smile for me now

Smile for me, won't you smile
(Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me
(Smile, whatcha lookin' all sad for? Nigga you black, smile for me now)

Smile for me
(Nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile, just smile
(No doubt, smile for me now and the next generation)

Now as I open up my story with the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone but I'm a dreamer

Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine

To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains

Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over foot broad chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my mommas thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma got's to do now is collect it and smile, smile

Smile for me, won't you smile
(Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me
(Smile, whatcha lookin' all sad for? Nigga you black, smile for me now)

Smile for me
(Nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile, just smile
(No doubt, smile for me now and the next generation)

Fuck the world as we elope and witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'

Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds and desperate hopes they'd get us

Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries, the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me, somebody save me

Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed
Hopin' I ain't cursed my babies, maybe now niggas feel me now
Picture my pain, embrace my words
Make the world change and still I smile nigga

And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outer space
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families make
Shine up on your soul and keep you safe

And all the homies that have passed away
Be there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac, smile

Smile for me, all ya need to do is smile
Smile for me, come on smile for me
