And everybody know somebody that
Know somebody that know somethin' 'bout it

And I want answers now

See, a lotta dudes like to act a fool
And all get all loud but that ain't my style

And he who he gonna get and what he gonna do
Run up on me if he want to
Out there impressin' his homies
But he stood up in front of his mama

And I kick in the door and let the forty-four get 'em

And the killas and the thugstas
That be fuckin' up the ballas
And the dealas and the hustlas

Got me comin' at you bokas in the
V.I. while they bumpin' lil' Jon I'm a brush ya
It's the psycho nigga twista from
Chicago rollin' with the Miami nigga that'll crush ya

We already been lookin' for drama
If a nigga try to get it to then we still gotta get 'em
Feelin' fury from my tough shit that can't never be true
And the Penicillin

I'm telling you Trick of in and still 'em
Got me swingin' Crysie and Hennessey bottles
In the club with my thug homies goin' for the skrilla
Don't get it twisted with that
Overnight celebrity you better be scared
Of me in my city I'm a killa

I ain't that rappin' type alright
And I that actin' type alright
This sulphate in my script
I'm a play on you and you just a square

See, once that Hennessey into
Me the whole industry is my enemy
If you ain't no ten to me or friend to me
Bitch don't pretend to be

I'm strictly for the thugs
I'm part of the streets and straight out the hood
That moments ghetto
(Ghetto)
Got me deep in gats for you wheezily cats

I'm straight out the county of Dade
Played on fire nigga MIA
Never gone south of the border
Americas most wanted, you gonna get slaughtered
