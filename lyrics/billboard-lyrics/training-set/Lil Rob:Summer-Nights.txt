Summer-Nights:Lil Rob:13:2005-09-17

I'm feeling good, feeling all right tonight
I'm  feeling good now, it's all good
In the neighborhood homes, Lil' Rob
I feel good, I feel all right

Crusing through the neighborhood
On a warm summer night
I feel good, thats right
I feel good now, summer nights

Summer days just sitting around
But when the sun goes down I'll be ready to party
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot

Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party untill the morning light
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Call the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone
It's seven thirty and the sun is going down
It's a summer night and the fun is going down

I picked her up and she looks all dolled up
(She looks good)
Sitting passenger in my rag impala
(Yeah)
I let her know she looks beautiful to me
The world is an ugly place but shes such a site to see

The kind of woman that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants to spend summer nights with me
The temp was eighty and I'm cruising with my lady
Playing some Ralphie Pagan, ohh baby, baby

I see my home boys and they are crusing in their rides
(Hey, was up homes?)
With their ladies sitting by their side
People think we look crazy but I think we look classy
But then again that's only if you ask me

Summer days just sitting around
But when the sun goes down I'll be ready to party
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot

Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party untill the morning light
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

My home boys throwing a back yard boogie
So every body gets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time
The DJ is spinning so I grab the mic and be like
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

The party is packed with beautiful woman
And a gang of the homies that want to get with them
And they'll say anything just to hit 'em
And it's usually a nice summer night when they did 'em

I don't know, it must be something in the air
Can't help but have a good time, because the feeling is there
To some people the feeling is rare
They're at the pad saying, "Goddam I wish I was there"

To have a drink, have a tok and hook up
With some one fine but the kind that looks up
Got to keep some pisto in the cup
Party until the sun comes up or we give up

Summer days just sitting around
But when the sun goes down I'll be ready to party
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot

Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party untill the morning light
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
Gotta try to have a good time
With your life otherwise it's just a waste
Either way I'm gonna party just in case
Like prince partied like it was 99, in 87, 88
I couldn't ask for no better weather

I'm right next to the Pacific to be specific
The candy paint job glows under the moon light
As I close out my summer night and say good night
It's time to put the top up and park it, drop it
Unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it

Walk into the pad and fall into bed
As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
And we do this all night long from dust till dawn
But it's not the quite the same when summer nights are gone
But even when theyre gone, it wont be long
Eight more months and once again its on

Summer days just sitting around
But when the sun goes down Ill be ready to party
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot

Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party untill the morning light
(Party)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
