I-m-Different:2 Chainz:6:2013-04-13

[Hook:]
 I'm different, yeah I'm different [x3]
 Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing [x4]
 Middle finger up to my competition
 I'm different, yeah I'm different [x3]
 Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing

[Verse 1:]
 Pull up to the scene, but my roof gone
 When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone
 And I beat the pussy like a new song
 2 Chainz but I got me a few on
 Everything hot, skip lukewarm
 Tell shawty to bust it open, Uncle Luke on
 Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping
 I don't feel good, but my trigger happy
 But the stripper happy, but they wish had me
 And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet
 And me and you are cut from a different fabric
 I fucked her so good it's a bad habit
 Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'
 Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
 You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
 Ass so big, I told her to look back at it
 Look back at it, look back at it
 Then I put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic
 I am so high... attic
 I am so high like an addict

[Hook:]
 I'm different, yeah I'm different [x3]
 Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing [x4]
 Middle finger up to my competition
 I'm different, yeah I'm different [x3]
 Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing

[Verse 2:]
 2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
 And when I get off the celly
 I made her meet at the telly
 When she meet at the telly
 I put it straight in her belly
 When it go in her belly, it ain't sh*t you can tell me
 Hair long, money long
 Me and broke niggas we don't get along
 Hair long, money long
 Me and broke niggas we don't get along
 I paid a 1, 000 dollars for my sneakers
 Ya told ye, a 100k for a feature
 Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed
 Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
 Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
 Yeah it's going down, she get up
 Might valet park a Brinks truck

 I'm different, yeah I'm different [x3]
 Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing [x4]
 Middle finger up to my competition
 I'm different, yeah I'm different [x3]
