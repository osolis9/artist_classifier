Feelin-It:JAY-Z:13:1997-06-28

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set
I'm feelin' it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I keep it realer than most I know your feelin' it
Cristal on ice I like those toes I keep spillin' it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes lookin' ill and shit

Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin' to live for like them lifers but
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher

We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up
I bout to hit these niggas that'll light they life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches

I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger lookin' gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talkin' 'bout large money what's the point?

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set
I'm feelin' it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin'
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin' what shorty
Where you disappear son?
Maintainin' puttin' myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in

I'm livin' the ill streets blues got you hunger painin'
Nothin to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singin' fool
I'm thorough in every boro my name be ringin'
Warmin' it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and

Ya Feelin' it? To all the girls
I bought the girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit

And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers cant really know I'm lovin' it ya feelin' it

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set
I'm feelin' it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set
I'm feelin' it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot

Those nightmares mom
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills
But these mils make me hot y'all feel me
Enough to stop the illin' right?

But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin' tight
I'm so confused
Okay I'm gettin' weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself
Look I don't need that now

It just once in a blue moon when there's nothin' to do and
The tension's too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zonin', me and the chick on the L and then we're bonin'
I free my mind sometimes I here myself moanin'

Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone man
It got me goin' shit

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set
I'm feelin' it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin' it, feel the Lex pushin' up on the set
I'm feelin' it through the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I'm feelin' it fill the glass to the top with Moet
