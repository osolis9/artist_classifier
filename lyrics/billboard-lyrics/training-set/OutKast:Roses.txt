Caroline
See Caroline, all the guys would say she's mighty fine
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you cursed out, or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though
You'd need a golden calculator to divide
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

Caroline
See she's the reason for the word 'Bitch'
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Trying to hurry up to get to baller or singer
Or somebody like that
And try to put on her makeup in the mirror
And crash, crash, crash, into a ditch, just bad
She needs a golden calculator to divide
The time it takes to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

Well she's got a hottie's body, but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party she was hardly acting naughty
I said shorty, "Would you call me?"
She said "Pardon me, are you ballin'?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt

But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost
Must take me for a geek a quick way to eat
A neat place to sleep, a rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat now
Go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see ya support bra not support you

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

I know you'd like to thank your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like boo boo boo
Yeah, roses really smell like boo boo boo

Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasin' cars
What happens when the dough gets low?
Bitch, you ain't that fine
No way, no way, no way

Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasin' cars
What happens when the dough gets low?
Bitch, you ain't that fine
No way, no way, no way

Crazy bitch, crazy bitch
Crazy bitch, crazy bitch
Crazy bitch, crazy bitch
Crazy bitch
