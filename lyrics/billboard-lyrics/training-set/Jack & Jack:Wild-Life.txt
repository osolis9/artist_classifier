Wild-Life:Jack & Jack:16:2014-08-23

Wild like wild life

Yeah, no telling what I might do
When I'm the right mood, you know me
I'm all up in the party like a V.I.P
And everything is looking better from my POV
Nocturnal animals, we don't sleep
And I'll probably forget you,
Cee lo green (cee-lo)
I'm saying like the amazon
A hundred degrees and that backsides bigger than a family tree.
So drop that thing like a fumble
Like ya talking to the king of the jungle
We got lions, tigers, bears oh my!
Every single ones turnt up, yo
I don't want anybody bringing the vibes down
So if you wanna wind down
Oh look what I found
A little something that will keep you awake until the break of dawn
Don't be afraid to get ready

I'm not done yet
Pass me the bottle
It's 2 am let's hit the throttle
Drink in my cup, hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get

Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life

Yeah, everybody going crazy on the dance floor
Jam packed, got a couple bands back
From the bank on my last trip like I ransacked
Everybody hanging like a string from a tampax
Yes, my bitches the amtrak
You ain't ever heard of flow quite like this
Everywhere i turn to you iced out wrists
She might be german, she might be swiss, god damn
And I'm feeling pretty hectic
Lights all around
Good thing I'm not epileptic
I'm kinda confused like I'm measuring in metric Talking shit
You better take it back, interception
Like the forests are blazing
Get the wild life jumping like an animal rave
I know your parents said they miss the good old days but things change

I'm not done yet
Pass me the bottle
It's 2 am let's hit the throttle
Drin kin my cup, hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get

Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life

Hey you, come here girl
Party with me (party with me)
You know it's going to be a wild night (so wild)
Move that body to the melody (melody)
I could show you how to live a wild life (wild life)
You ain't gotta spend a dime It's free (it's free)
You know it's going to be a wild night (let's go)
Doors opened you don't need a key (no key)
I could show you how to live a wild life (wild life)

I'm not done yet
Pass me the bottle
It's 2 am let's hit the throttle (vroom vroom)
Drink in my cup, hands going up
Let's hit the dance floor and get

Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
Wild like wild life
