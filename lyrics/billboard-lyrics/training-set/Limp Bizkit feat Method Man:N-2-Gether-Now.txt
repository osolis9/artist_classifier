N-2-Gether-Now:Limp Bizkit feat Method Man:17:2000-01-29

DJ Mia
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Who can be the boss?
Look up to the Cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path
Runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode
I'm dashin' all the media strikes, keep the media dykes
As re enforcements for the fight
And that alone will keep John Gotti on the phone
Yea

Tangled in his own
I got the Bees on the track
Where the fuck you at?
(Tical)
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now
(Shut the fuck up)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills
That keep my total bills over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it
Wait until the second round
I'll knock him out

They call me Big John Stud
My middle name Mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thugs
That can't stand the flood
What up doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd, the sure shot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged
(Plugged)
Learn
Temperature's too hot for sunblock
(Burn)

Playin' with minds can get you state time
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind
Killa Bees in the club when there's ladybug
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day 'til they both slug
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me?
'Cause it's your blood
Murder is tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us, they know not what they do, our praises do
I'm big like easy, ya big bamboo

What's that, I didn't hear you?
(Shut the fuck up)
Come on a little louder
(Shut the fuck up)
Everybody 'n' 2 gether now
(Shut the fuck up)
What?
(Jus' shut the fuck up)
What?
(Jus' shut the fuck up)
What's that, I didn't hear you?
(Shut the fuck up)
Come on a little louder
(Shut the fuck up)
Everybody 'n' 2 gether now
(Shut the fuck up)
What?
(Shut the fuck up)
What?
(Shut the fuck up)

Headstrong, deadcon, dead by dawn
Deadweight they dead wrong
Let's get it on, twelve rounds of throwdown
Who hold crown?
Protect land with both pound
Limp Bizkit, get around like merry go
What's the scenario?
Comin' through your stereo
Why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals
Delicious

Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out their front teethes
Tryin' to taste mine
Actin' like they heard through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the baseline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticle
Where you find that monster?
She beautiful
Wu Tang and Limp Bizkit
(Limp Bizkit)
Roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker
Pull the plug and then jet

Mic check
So what's it all about?
Where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised, for the blood of virgin eyes
Limpin' on the track with Method
So get the sunblock
You get your one shot, until you dissolve
I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere prepare
You'll be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare

Now you're turned into stone, without a microphone
(Phone)
But don't you forget you're in the zone
(So shut the fuck up)
And take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's whack
Doodoo is doodoo
When it's weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those who didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu Tang clan for the crown

What's that, I didn't hear you?
(Shut the fuck up)
Come on a little louder
(Shut the fuck up)
Everybody 'n' 2 gether now
(Shut the fuck up)
What?
(Shut the fuck up)
What?
(Just shut the fuck up)
What's that, I didn't hear you?
(Shut the fuck up)
Come on a little louder
(Shut the fuck up)
Everybody 'n' 2 gether now
(Shut the fuck up)
What?
(Shut the fuck up)
What?
(Just shut the fuck up)

It was over your head all day every day
S I N Y, One O Three O Four
Wu Tan Killa Bees,
And the Limp B I Z K I T
Ya know the time, ya know to rhyme
It ain't easy bein' greezy
In a world full of cleanliness
And you know all that other madness
We gone
Peace
(Limp Bizkit, Method Man)
(Rock the house y'all, bring it on)

{Hey wait up, where you guys goin'?
You're not recordin' are you?
Are you?
I'm all alone
I can't do this
Feel it, uh
Feel it
You guys feel it out there?
Check your head if you feel it
Hey, hey, hey
Every day is brighter than the next day
At least that's what you think
Every day is brighter than the next day
At least that's what you think}
