Murphy Lee: Verse 1
Come on,
I'm sorta like my brother, but very different from mothers,
like a special police man, I'm always undercovers,
I love you if you love me, I kiss 'em only if kissable,
Keep 'em if they keepable, Diss 'em if they dismissable, (Luv Me Baby)
School boy visit you, Make it outside the visible,
Teachin' you, makin' you listen to me like a principle,
Sendin' you, flowers and candy to your family and,
I think it's cute how you still live with your granny man,
(Luv Me Baby), Work in the morning, school in the evenings,
Weekday a Weekend, Teachin' reasons I'm the one you believe in,
Demolish ya Def, With knowledge yourself,
Now you rock a smaller belt for my nutritional health, (Luv Me Baby)
I'm the don ma, Teach you what you need to be taught,
You know the these feelings that I brought,
Ma, they all in your thoughts,
You can't love nobody 'till you love you,
So when you do love somebody, you know what to do

Chorus: Murphy Lee (Jazze PHA and Sleepy Brown)
(I'ma make you love me baby...)
I'ma make you love me baby,
hug me baby, place no one above me baby,

(Gimme a chance baby girl I'm your man...)
Gimme a change I'm the dirrty you missin

(I'ma make you love me baby...)
I'ma make you love me baby,
hug me baby,
place no one above me baby,
(Make you wanna kiss and hug me baby,)
Huggin' and Kissin', Kissin' and Huggin',
(Gimme a chance baby girl I'm your man...)
Gimme a chance I'm the dirrty you lovin'

Murphy Lee: Verse 2
See I'm the man like groomin' husband,
Grandfather or Daddy, brother, uncle man nephew or cousin,
I'm the one like Tracy McGrady,
Play with me or play me,
Make me your man or make me your baby, (Luv Me Baby)
Spoil me mama, back rub oil me mama,
When I'm left over aluminum foil me mama,
I'ma be there when you wake up hungry,
You can call me ya homie,
I'ma be there when you straight up lonely, man, (Luv Me Baby)
And I ain't tryin' to get mushy ya dig?
And all pushy ya dig?
I just like the fact ya tushy is big,
Can I touch it touch it?
Maybe caress it and rub it, take advantage of it,
Show me your private when we in public, (Luv Me Baby)
You actin' fresh this way like "but guess",
But really you princess cut, invisible set,
Incredible sex, way way ahead of the rest,
Best personality, face, booty and chest

Chorus: Murphy Lee (Jazze PHA and Sleepy Brown)

Gimme a change I'm the dirrty you missin

I'ma make you love me baby,
hug me baby,
place no one above me baby,
(Make you wanna kiss and hug me baby,)
Huggin' and Kissin', Kissin' and Huggin',
(Gimme a chance baby girl I'm your man...)
Gimme a chance I'm the dirrty you lovin'

Murphy Lee: Verse 3
I need an er-day girl, an all day provider,
Don't matter if I'm behind her, as long as I'm inside her,
She be with it and I don't wanna be commited,
As long as I don't forget it, the night after I hit it,
She cool man, Never disrespectin' me,
As long as I can help her with a few Bill Belamys,
And she ain't even tellin' me that I'm the only Dirrty she dig,
And if she do, I'ma tell her we better off bein' friends
