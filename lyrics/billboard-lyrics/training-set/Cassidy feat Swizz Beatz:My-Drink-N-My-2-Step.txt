I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on

I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on

I got my drink and my dutchie, I just be the murda
People think that I'm lucky, my link lookin' husky
Big stones, its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron on and tell them that it's on

Put the smoke in the air and get stoned
The whip's sittin' on 2 6's, the lips chrome
My money used to be immature now my shit grown
Big wheels, big homes, I'm doin' it big, holmes

Its on, its on, its on the kid home
Get tell the Patron and tell them that it's on
I do my 2 step and let the link swing
Hold the drink with the left hand and show the pink ring
(Bling)

I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on

I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on

Ayyo, they wanna be like me
Recreate my flow, imitate my flow
The relate my flow by while they try
And take my flow, I make my dough

Ayyo, I can make it rain 'cause I been making it snow
But yo, I been takin' it slow, I wasn't around
But the car crash couldn't lay the hustla down
Naw, I'm still here for real, I'm still here
It wasn't lookin' pretty but Swizzy, I'm still here

They said, I coulda been brain-dead in a wheelchair
But I'm standin' in the booth and the skills are still here
Yeah, the hustla home, the hustla home
Let's celebrate a toast with a cup of Patron

I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on

I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on

Yeah, yeah, put your dutch in the air
Smoke haze, let the smoke raise up in the air
You might have seen me in the guinea at a couple of fairs
The engine in the trunk, the doors go up in the air

Yeah, and I been gone for a couple of years
I done sweat, I done bled, shed a couple of tears
I ain't stressin', it's a blessing that the hustla here
Let's celebrate a toast, put ya cup in the air

I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on

I got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Got my drink n my 2 step, my drink n my 2 step
Its on, its on, its on and Im home
Get the Patron and tell them that it's on
