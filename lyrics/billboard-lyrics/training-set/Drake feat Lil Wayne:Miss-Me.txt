Miss-Me:Drake feat Lil Wayne:2:2010-12-18

I said tell me what's really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm bout my paper like a muthafucking scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife
Your bitch is as hot as ice
Everytime you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right)
Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire she should work tonight
Call her King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twerk something, basis
She just tyna make it,
so she's right here getting naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her
but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper
and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz,
can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stands for
"Do Right And Kill Everything"
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one we get married just to say
we fucking did it
And girl I'm fucking serious,
I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on
and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, Damn,
I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch'em stealing flows
Cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain'ta rehearsal,
the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowing
Cause it's on,
Yeah girl it's on,
You know what it is
when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little
when I'm gone
Yeah, I just hope you miss me a little
when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for,
anything you down for
I know things have changed, I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope you miss me a little when your gone
Ooh shit, motherfucker, goddamn
Kicking bitches out the condo like Pam
Getting money every day,
I'm a groundhog
'bout to scoop your girl up like
a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it
'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
Jmes Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make'em run and tell their friends
like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan,
I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me,
that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me
when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish
but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her
cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang,
slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot,
you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable,
like you lyin in soup
And when I'm in the booth,
bitch the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't trippin
I know Drizzy gonna kill'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent,
don't bend'em
Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up, hoe
Gotta do it one time for Haiti,
What up, Zoe?
Weezy F Baby
and the "F" is for "front door"
Cause that's where I bring it,
Soo Woo if you bangin
motherfucker
Uh, forever in our hearts,
JJ, we love you boy,
H-Town
