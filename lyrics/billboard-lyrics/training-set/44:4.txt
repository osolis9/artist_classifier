Let me tell you what I'm dreaming of
And I hope you'll understand
There's a place where love is everywhere
And they call it Wonderland

Take me to Wonderland
Where lovers can be free
The magic will never end
For always you and me

Let me tell you what I'm dreaming of
And I hope you'll understand
There's a place where love is everywhere
And they call it Wonderland

Take me to Wonderland
Where lovers can be free
The magic will never end
For always you and me
Take me to Wonderland
Where lovers can be free
The magic will never end
For always you and me

(Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up... Get up... Get up on your feet)

Let me tell you what I'm dreaming of
And I hope you'll understand
There's a place where love is everywhere
And they call it Wonderland

Take me to Wonderland
Where lovers can be free
The magic will never end
For always you and me
Take me to Wonderland
Where lovers can be free
The magic will never end
For always you and me
