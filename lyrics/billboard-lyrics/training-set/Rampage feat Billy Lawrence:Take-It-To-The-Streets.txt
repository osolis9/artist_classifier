Take-It-To-The-Streets:Rampage feat Billy Lawrence:5:1997-11-22

[Incomprehensible]

Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on

I got chicks in my livin' room shakin' they asses
Flip mode get ya high smokin' Weed and Hash
Yo, it's all about fun sex and drugs
Makin' more money than all your rap thugs

I'm seein' broads and panties passed around
Rampage is the nigga from underground
Sweet potato, kid crusader, I want a shorty like Jada
Tits are off like a mile later

So we can get buck wild, that's my style
I'm in a mansion in strong isle
Drinkin' Don P and Cristal, yo that's the spoke file
I'm livin' like Adino Brown, bow down

I'm the talk of the town, this is the low down
My show down, you can bet all your chips
I'ma take you around the world run up in ya girl
Ramp's in, call me Earl, uh

Brothers everywhere, it's sisters everywhere
Rockin' to Ramp's new beat
When I hear his music
I can't help but get down like they do

Upside down, I'ma turn it out, bust it out
I'm the one you talkin' about
Hittin' Hennessey with my peeps from Tennessee
Givin' you a head rush straight to your dome

I'm in the zone, plus, I'm sittin' on chrome
You jealous, what? Take your black ass home
Yo, spots been blown from the brown skin pretty tone
I got it sown, plus, I'm bad to the bone

It's hot to def, make you breathe yo last breath
We could take it to the streets, we could call the ref
Yo, I'm makin' mad moves that's way to the top
Flip mode is the squad and the Ramp won't stop

Brothers everywhere, it's sisters everywhere
Rockin' to Ramp's new beat
When I hear his music
I can't help but get down like they do

I'm doin' what I gotta do, I hear Charlie
Rampage is the boss of New York
Yo, I fill more fantasies than Mr. Rock
Don't eat pork, rap is the game I start

Keep it movin', throw yo hands in the air
Shake yo ass like you just don't care
Shake yo ass like you just don't care
Shake yo ass like you just don't care

Take a look around, it's plain to see that
Everybody's bopin' to Ramp's new music in the street
I hear music in the street and I hear a funky beat
And I get down, oh, I get down

Brothers everywhere, it's sisters everywhere
Rockin' to Ramp's new beat
When I hear his music
I can't help but get down like they do

Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on

Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
