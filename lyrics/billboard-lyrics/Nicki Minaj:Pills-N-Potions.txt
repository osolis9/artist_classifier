Pills n potions
We're overdosing
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove

Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doing wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here looking so ungrateful
I'mma keep it moving be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearing on the bible that they love you
When really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on ‘em
I just reflect on 'em

Pills n potions
We're overdosing
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove

Yo, people will love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga's life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzi
I see the envy when I'm causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em
Cop cribs in the hills on ‘em

Pills n potions
We're overdosing
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it but I still love you

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time we'll be fine
In due time, aah

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
