Ride-Out:Kid Ink, Tyga, Wale, YG & Rich Homie Quan:14:2015-05-09

Came in at first, have bad luck
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nuttin
We done sold out everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll out now everybody smashin'
Get ready cause you know it bout to be a problem
Hey

Hope you ready cause you know it bout to be a problem
This the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gone
Ride on forever
We ride out together

Pull up right in your zone

Takeover the street

That's how we roll
And we gone ride on forever
We ride out together
Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it do it my way
Fucks you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominos
But chase vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope
For that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy better check your tone

You gon' need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper

Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers

Yea, ain't nothin', but pure luxury
You lookin' left of me, should be looking up to me

Preferably one of the best
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
Be loyal, real, and respect

Stay ahead of the rest
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress

This the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gone

Ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Takeover the street
That's how we roll
And we gone ride on forever
We ride out together

Got no time to waste

Ain't no way these niggas stoppin' me
Ohh Noo
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
Hey, look and I can do this with my eyes closed
Blind fold two times over
Ride solo, but got women and got soldiers

I ain't trippin but can try and get it, your night's over
Talkin' on melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's defeat to a giant?
Niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less
Them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call the peoples and leave 'em 100 pieces divided
That's cold blooded
And I've been this dope like 4 summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas delayed
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gone
Ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Takeover the street
That's how we roll
And we gone ride on forever
We ride out together (It's YG 4hunnid)
Is you ridin? Is you wit all the burglarizing and the violence?
If Jimmy got caught up but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions
Is you gon' keep quiet?
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake friend syndrome
And there's no cure so them symptoms is gone show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up!
Each one teach one
Motivate each one to be somethin'
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this this now if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make the bread come quicker
For me and my dead one hitters
Ride out
