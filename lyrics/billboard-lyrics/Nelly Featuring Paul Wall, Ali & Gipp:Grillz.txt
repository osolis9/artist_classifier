Grillz:Nelly Featuring Paul Wall, Ali & Gipp:1:2006-05-20

Rob the jewelry store an' tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond an' the bottom row's gold
Yo, we 'bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 mo' at the top
All invisible set an' little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum an' white gold, traditional gold
I'm changin' grillz er'rday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely, in my white tee
Or on South Beach, in my wife B
V V an' studded, you can tell when they cut it
Ya see my grandmama hate it but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin'
Eyes stay low from the cheifin'
I got a grill they call Penny Candy, you know what that means
It look like Now n' Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothin', only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in ya city, somewhere out in ya hood, just say
Smile fo' me, Daddy, what you lookin' at?
Let me see ya grill, let me see my what
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store an' tell 'em to make me a grill
Smile fo' me, Daddy, what you lookin' at?
I wanna see your grill, you wanna see my what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Had a whole top diamond an' the bottom rows gold
What it do, baby? It's the Ice Man, Paul Wall
I got my mouth lookin' somethin' like a disco ball
I got the diamonds an' the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleamin' like I'm chewin' on aluminum foil
Smile an' showin' off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is an' bought a grill
20 karats, 30 stacks, let 'em know I'm so fo' real
My motivation is from 30 pointers V VS
To furniture, my mouthpiece simply symbolize obsessed
I got the wrist wear an' neck wear dats captivatin'
But it's what smiles dat got these arms lookin' spectatin'
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth an' you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grillz
Smile fo' me, Daddy, what you lookin' at?
Let me see ya grill, let me see my what
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill

Gipp got dem yellows, got dem purples, got dem reds
Lights gon' 'head an' make you woozy in ya head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mob got colors like a fruit loop box
Dis what it do when the lou ice grill, 'Country Grammar'
Where the hustlas move bricks an' the gangstas bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot them on the top in the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissin' nobody but let's bring it to the light
Yeah, was the first wit my mouth bright white
Yeah, these hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4s, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got 4 different sets, it's a fabulous thang
1 white, 1 yellow like fabulous chain
An' the other set is same, got my name in the mold
Had a whole top diamond an' the bottom row's gold
