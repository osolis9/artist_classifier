Everyday I'm hustlin', hustlin'

Who the fuck your think your fucking with? I'm the fucking boss

Seven forty-five, white on white, that's fuckin Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat (wah?)
I keep 'em comin' back, (what?) we keep 'em comin' back
I'm in the distribution, I'm like Atlantic

I got them motherfuckers flyin' 'cross the Atlantic
I know Pablo (Pablo), Noriega, the real Noriega
He owe me a hundred favors
I ain't petty, nigga, we buy the whole thang

See most of my niggas really still deal caine
My roof back (roof back), my money rides (my money rides)
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatch black, I cry for a hundred nights

He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lifes
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev', everyday I'm hustlin
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev', everyday I'm hustlin'

Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm

We never steal cars but we deal hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
I caught a charge,
(you caught a charge?)

I caught a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Ain't 'bout no funny shit, still bitches and business
I'm on my money shit, still whippin' them Benzs

Major league, who catchin' because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finish
I feed 'em steroids to strengthen up all my chickens
They're flyin' over Pacifics to be specific

Triple C's, you know it's back, we holdin' sacks
So n, go on rat, run and tell 'em that (tell em dat)
Mo' cars,
(mo' cars)

mo' hoes
(mo' hoes)
mo' clothes
(mo' clothers)

mo blows
(mo' blows)
Everyday I'm hustlin'

Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev, everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm
It's time to spend my thrills, custom spinnin' wheels
I ain't drove in a week, them bitches spinnin' still
Talk about me because these suckers scared to talk about me
Killers talkin' 'bout me, it ain't no talk about me
It ain't no walkin' 'round me
See all these killers 'round me
Lot of drug dealin' 'round me
Goin' down in, Dade County
Don't tote no 22's, Magnum cost me twenty two
Sat it on them 22's, birds go for twenty two
Lil' mama super thick, she say she 22
She seen them 22's, we in room 222
I touch work like I'm convertible Burt
I got distribution, so I'm convertin' the work
In the M I A yo, them niggas rich off yayo
Steady slangin' yayo, my Chevy bangin', hey yo
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev', everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev', everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm
