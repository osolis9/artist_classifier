On-My-Level:Wiz Khalifa feat Too $hort:10:2011-07-09

It's the champagne pourin'
Big joint rollin
Bombay sippin
No blunt smoking
Bad bitch gettin
Thick and she got some friends with her
I take â€˜em out pourin' shots of liquor
Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures
N-gga, you know everything Taylored
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you aint got no paper
That's the rules, high as f-ck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass â€˜em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool
Thats what I have to do
See after drinking champagne all night

Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might
Homie I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeaah)
So let me take one shot to the brain

And I order three more shots
I'm going in, ayy
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeaah)
Spent a couple dollars on my engine

motor roaring when I back out the garage
Gin got me drunk as f-ck stumbling out the bar
Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard, roll the camera
Life just like a movie, I'm the star
Wish you was in my position
You too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin
Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash n-ggas
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mate
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne
See after drinking champagne all night

Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might
Homie I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeaah)
So let me take one shot to the brain

And I order three more shots
I'm going in, ayy
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeaah)
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin

From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I aint yawnin
I'm wide awake, we aint eatin', we aint sleepin'
These b-tches so high man, we aint even speakin
We just freakin
You rollin' with short dog baby
She was high on that pill so I f-cked yo lady
Come to my house I give â€˜em everything they want
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, Marijuana
She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends
and this a Wednesday night, this aint the weekend
See after drinking champagne all night
Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might

Homie I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)

Man I swear I'm on my level

Man I'm sloppy drunk
Man I swear Im on my level
