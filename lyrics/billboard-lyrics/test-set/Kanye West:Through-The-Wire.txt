Through-The-Wire:Kanye West:4:2004-05-08

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation, man

Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town what's going on
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork

How do you console my mom or give her light support

Telling her, her sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I've been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making man

I really apologize how I sound right now man
If this ain't clear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said like six weeks

You know we had reconstru...
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw

I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was missing from half my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man

This is what I gotta say right here dawg
Yeah, turn me up yeah
Uh

What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time

In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue

I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

You know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um
I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
You can't be serious man
