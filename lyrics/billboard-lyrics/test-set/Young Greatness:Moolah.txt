Moolah:Young Greatness:18:2016-06-25

All my life I hustled just to get that Moolah
And stack my chains up, I'm gon' see the jewelrer
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work All I ever had was the cocaine
My cousin leaned out with the do' man
And GT switchin' four lanes
From the store with the coca like propane
On the block where the shots go "bang!"
Only real niggas really gon' hang
All your life, you was saved by the bell
I was saved by the cocaine, ay!
Young boys with choppers, young boys with lawyers
We stand in the kitchen and whip out that work

All my life I hustled just to get that Moolah
And stack my chains up, I'm gon' see the jewelrer
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work Got the trap house bumpin'
First in the month where the kids run
Got the hold block jumping on fire
They better ring when I come through
Addicted to Moolah, no favors
This feel like a hell of a day bro
I'm falling in love with that coco
She [?]
Got the hold block in a choke-o
Middle finger to the popo

Cool is so coola, addicted to Moolah

All my life I hustled just to get that Moolah

And stack my chains up, I'm gon' see the jewelrer
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work (Mash-up)
All my life I hustled just to get that Moolah
And stack my chains up, I'm gon' see the jewelrer
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work
