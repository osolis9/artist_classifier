Girl-Tonite:Twista feat Trey Songz:2:2006-01-21

Yo, oh, ya boy Jim Johnson big daddy
Mmm, mmm

Baby, when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

Baby, when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

It's getting late lil' mama, we been in the club too long
Let me take you out to my home
Tell me what a nigga gotta do to get you out that thong
When are you really gonna make up your mind shorty?
See Twista work that stick, now can I get in it from behind shorty?
Show you what I'm working with, ooh

Come on let me take you to the penthouse suite
Pull out some old school Marvin Gaye and put it on repeat
Shorty come and show me you can take it boo
Let me fuck you first, now girl show me what you can do

Come and fuck me renow, girl doin' thangs that will get you gone
Put me on the couch, I can make you moan, eat you up
When we in the kitchen let you get on top when we ride the stove
When she told me to do it faster that’s when I dug deeper
Now every time I see her I gotta freak her

'Cause when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

'Cause when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

Make her feel like she popped a pill, got her feelin' ecstasy
Took her to the bedroom about to make her an overnight celebrity
Fina get up in the sack and I hope you're ready for me girl
Fina hit it from the back when I bump and ready for the world

Ooh, I want you to hold me
While I'm kissin' all over your body slowly
Give it to ya like an O.G, in, out
Show me how you work the wall, up, down
Show me how ya work them jaws

In the bed when I floss it girl
You will catch that drank
That’s why I love to get freaky with you
'Cause you a nasty thang

Shawty, please
In, out, that’s right
Show me how you work the wall
Up, down

'Cause when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut, it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

'Cause when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

Hit it to that Jodici
Hit it to that Jagged Edge
Hit it to that New Edition
Hit you with that full through

Don’t you worry 'bout a damn thang, no
See how I do it to her
When I sip some do it to it fluid

Hit it to some Isley Brothers
Hit it to some Sade
Hit it to some R. Kelly
And hit it to some Marvin Gaye

Don’t you worry 'bout a damn thang, no
See how I do it to her, gotta sip that fluid
When I touch her she like

Said don’t you worry 'bout a damn thing
No, no, no, no, no girl
'Cause when I touch her she like
When I rub her, when I hug her
When I love her, when I touch her she like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
