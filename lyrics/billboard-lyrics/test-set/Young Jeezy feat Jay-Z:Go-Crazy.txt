Go-Crazy:Young Jeezy feat Jay-Z:22:2005-10-29

Guess who's bizzack
Still smell the blow on my clothes
Like crispy cream I was cooking them o's
Like horseshoes I was tossing them o's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow
I'm emotional
I hug the block
I'm so emotional
I love my glock
Cash rules everything around me
So whats realer
Bout the scriller so call me a ghost face killer
Its kinda hard to be drug free
When Georgia power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles been killing em ever since
Been paid to tell the truth it only make sense

When they play that new jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
If you catch me in the club pimping doing my thang
When they play that new jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
They pop my collar then they swing they chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doing they thang

Wont stop till my whole team in thug mansion
And I sell like pac
Thats a thugs passion
And this the realest shit I ever wrote
And all eyes on me like a microscope
Young jeezy give em one more chance
They try to shine like you and get your whole advance
Like my main man pulla talk real slick
Look I'm OK but my watch sick
You don't gotta like a n***a
Just respect my mind
This is how I'm eating now
So respect my grind
The way I put them words together
Reminds me about how I put them byrds together

Buy 18 the hard way
Now have a humble nigga thinkin' 'bout gun play
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns
A lot of holes, a lot of blood dog
That shit ain't fun
So I suggest that you don't play with my chain
Or ill send these hollow's at you
Let them play with ya brain
The streets is watching
The name is warn
The products white
A star is born
Pimping I'm so fly
I take this parachute off
I might fall and die
Wrap the work with spandex with the latex
Then we ship it outta town
Call it safe sex
