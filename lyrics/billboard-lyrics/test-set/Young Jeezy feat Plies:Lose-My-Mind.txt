Lose-My-Mind:Young Jeezy feat Plies:3:2010-08-14

Why y’all trip, I’m just fine
Twelve forty five, ‘Bout that time
Ain’t done it all week time to unwind
Trend like tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can’t spell sober, lose my mind

I’m hearin’ voices in my head think im schizoprenic
I swear they sayin’ lets get it from another planet
Thirty six thousand times I’m doin’ summer salts
Do it right and you can leave ya whole summer off
I’m out my mind, yeah a nigga seein’ double ya’ll
Tell me what’s the chance of jeezy fuckin’ both of ya’ll
She sad as long as we can do it with ya ice on
You dedicated my will, Leave the lights on
I’m out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets
In my black and orange charger, call it trick or treat
It ain’t nothin’ to a boss, my goons got goons
How stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms

Why y’all trip, I’m just fine
Twelve forty five, ‘Bout that time
Ain’t done it all week time to unwind
Trend like tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can’t spell sober, lose my mind

Guess what my momma told me, she hate my patnas
Guess why she hate em though,
‘Cause all of ‘em robbin’
F-ck the police, ’cause all of ‘em problems
White girls fun, ’cause all of ‘em swallow
Why I aint f-ck ha at the house, ’cause the b-tch holla
And where the pill man at, he need a blue dolphin
All broke ass n-gga, stop c-ck blockin’
Security, I need help ’cause the b-tch stalkin’
A half f-ckin’ mill, that’s what the whip cost me
One-hundred dollars, that’s what the p-ssy cost me
And when the n-gga start hatin’, that’s when the n-gga lost me
Fantastico, that’s what the h-es call me

Why y’all trip, I’m just fine
Twelve forty five, ‘Bout that time
Ain’t done it all week time to unwind
Trend like tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can’t spell sober, lose my mind

Drop the top, no broad, got ha titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doin’ what I do best, d-boy stuntin’
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin’
Step in cleaner then a new glock-40
Nickname in the A, strapped up shorty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-O, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn’t understand,it’s a black thing
You know we drink that rozay ’til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out

Why y’all trip, I’m just fine
Twelve forty five, ‘Bout that time
Ain’t done it all week time to unwind
Trend like tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can’t spell sober, lose my mind
