Excuse me miss, what's your name

(Baby Bash) Go girl, uh, a show girl, uh, go-getter, for cheddar,
Denero, dope girl, a money on the dance floor
Getting low girl, uh, a trow girl,
with game that'll make my toes curl
cause she's a beast in the bed and I'ma beast with her

she rocking the fresh js, stilettos, the Jimmy Chu's

black white and yellow bone, watchin' what they jelly on
bringing major fedy home oo what's poppin

bringing daddy money home

Send her down to Meh-hico
She brining me the border back

Excuse me miss, what's your name

I'm tryin to get her drunk
Take her to the telian goose
Spark a fat ass blunt

Unplug the smoke detector
Get my head off and then eject her

Imma macaroni man
I don't think you understand
I don't pay for pussy when

Steady stackin hustler man
All about my rubber band
Real nigga haven't changed about money

Gotta keep my paper right
The brainwasher up all night
Picture this flow, she getting my dough
She bought a brand new bike
Letting em know, used to be proud
I don't care she dike
Baby can go, put on a show, she can do what I like

Excuse me miss, what's your name

Drop, drop it low, make, make it pop,
