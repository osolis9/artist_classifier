Can-t-Stop-Won-t-Stop:Young Gunz:6:2003-08-02

Sick sicker, remix
Okay, Young Gunnaz, okay
Seein' me, check
Big Face, that's right
Big Leo, right
Big bird, yeah holla

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down
The girls, the girls they love us
(Say what)
(Look she right there)
(Her man he right there)

Yup, It's only right that we make it a remix
Young Gunnaz, and Chingy just to give it a lil' twist
Next generation, you better stay focused
Youngaz before they time, man you already know this
Ball 'em, never call 'em, kick 'em out before their moment
It seem like once you done, they start drawlin'
You never have 'em, so you cuff 'em, when you grab him
I treat 'em all the same, even the bad ones

Go Magnum, rose gold chain, for show aim
Four four Magnum, tell C and P when they done better blast 'em
I be laid back, smokin' bags, playin' Madden
You know we tap 'em, middle room, bathroom
Living room, bathroom, sit at home cap 'em
You got it, It's nothin' I had 'em, you can have 'em
Seein' Neef we the streets, Gunnaz we the last one

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down
The girls, the girls they love us
(Say what)
(Look she right there)
(Her man he right there)

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down
The girls, the girls they love us
(Say what)
(Look she right there)
(Her man he right there)

Man, I can't Stop, won't stop
Girl, quit actin' like ya can't pop, won't drop
To the flo' I move crowds like I moved hop
Man, '94 on the block, hand full on my jock
You wanna' know, It's official when I step up in it
You wanna' party, lemme' get the Y G's
And we a be there in a minute
Maybe chicken-head wit' it

Got the boxed up Benz, Range, and got both 'em get it

The girls, the girls they love me

You know I stay fresh 'till death, like Doug E
(Doug E)

(Mug me)
Got drank, in row so meet me at the Club E, D D T

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down

Neefy, and Chris wicked game, wicked chick
One had to pay a dime, pay in no mind
It's quite obserd, just sayin' the right words
I like nice hair, titties, and nice curves
Givin' neck dose, smokin' on a bag fa' sho'
Shawty's catch everything, everytime I let go
(Okay)
I get her poppin', and let 'em finish the rest yo

And when I'm lookin' for a girl, why I check fo'
Need me a chick, that'll see me squeeze the fifth
On the court, pleed the fifth, never leave me for a check
But, the Visa on the whip, so overseas get the bricks
Bringin' all 'dat cake, that's what I need for you to do
I be heated if you screw, bring it all back straight
Rock on me, we pop homie, drink it all back straight
Better warn me, ya Barreta on me
Baby all 'dat hate, will lead to you losin' all that weight
Holla' at ya boy

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down
