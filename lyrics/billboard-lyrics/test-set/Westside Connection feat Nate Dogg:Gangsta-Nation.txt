Consider this an invitation, to my gangsta nation

Na na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na na
(Ohh ohh)
Na na na na na na na na
(What what)
Na na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na na
(Yeah yeah)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

Homey, I'm tired of the cowards parkin' like this, walkin' like this
From the concrete when they chalkin' like this
And there he goes and a trick pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gack ain't gonna bust and know that

It's a dub ass C thang dub C brain
And we don't kick it but bust it and kaki jeans strains
I'm done movin', I'm clearin' the crowd
It's the who bangin' bandanna criminiminal, the original

Evacuate the building look here come a plane
No, it's the big bad Westside Connect Gang
And bump what you plain homey this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear broad insane

And we number one gunners no we ain't stunners
It's real with us partna, dealers and drug runners
And Mack need a [unverified] in a H2 Hummer
Lookin' hotter than the South Central L.A. summer, let's go

This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

What the hell is Ice Cube talkin' about
That's how you get these here parked in you mouth
Westside ride trick, the same old spit
I don't conversate with chicks I ain't goin' hit

I don't holla at these pros that sing like Ashanti
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre
(Uhh)
You kinda [unverified]
But I'm with so my Andre got to be bomb rate

Have you seen us, naw, haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin' blunts out of Cuban cigars

Big by the linnas sip notice by the liters
With a flock of pros on us 'cause the conic is [unverified]
And to my G's incarcerated and on probation
I'ma stay bagin' for the whole G Nation nigga

This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

It's a gangsta nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the B in the sea
Now tell the truth rappers you don't bow like me
'Cause I'm really from the gang y'all is industry

And while I'm servin' up and comin' young hustlas and gluckas
Bangin' for the hood causin' havoc and ruckus
You fools actin' label, kissin' up like suckas
And your trick solder down when you pee lil bustas

One thing I do know, I ain't the uno
Big puno rap sumo on pruno
(You know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
In my affiliation to the gangsta nation

I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like a stress sac, boy you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
'Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin' on it

Look check this out man
We got a gangsta nation goin' down over here
So y'all might as well bow down
And join this Westside thang man

'Cause once you get with this, partna you as G as can be
Believe that homeboy, it's like that
Fred Red, what I'd tell you homey
It ain't a hit till Nate Dogg spit

This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

Na na na na na na na na
