Here-We-Go:Trina Featuring Kelly Rowland:3:2006-02-11

Look, I ain't got nothin' to say to you
I can't even believe you
You know what? I'm too fly for this shit
You playin' yourself

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I can't take this no more, no, no, no

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I ain't tryin' to hear it, not this time

Look nigga what you think this is?
You treatin' me like a random chick?
You done forgot, who introduced you to Rocks
And poppin' all that Cris' and shit

Who let you hit it from the back any way that you liked
And any debts, I can pay the price
I thought I was a chick you would make yo' wife
And now a bitch can't even stay the night?

I can't even look in your face without wantin' to slap you
Damn I thank God, I ain't get that tattoo
You better thank God I ain't have the strap boo
You ain't even worth that trick get at you

Matter of fact, trick get at dude
I'm convinced I ain't got shit to ask you
And tell that triflin' bitch she can have you
I ain't lookin at you no more, I'm lookin' past you

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I can't take this no more, no, no, no

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I ain't tryin' to hear it, not this time

When my girl came through with the news
All I did was think about me and you like, damn
What a chick gotta do to get with a real nigga
That know how to stay true like man

Know one quarter to 8, you better hop on the bus or a cab
I shed so many tears, can't believe how many years
The baddest bitch put up with yo' dusty ass
Now you know that I'm the Queen of Miami

All that loud talkin', lyin', save that shit for your mammy
Sounds like, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"
I'm like, uh-huh, okay
Whassup, shut up

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I can't take this no more, no more, no more

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I ain't tryin' to hear it, not this time

Now all my ladies say
If you feel me say
If you can't take no more say, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin'
I can take this no more

That's why I'm packing up my jewels, grabbin' up my furs
I'll be back, for all the shoes and purses, watch me bounce
In the seven forty-five while I'm ridin' out
'Cause I'm not tryin' to hear it, not this time
