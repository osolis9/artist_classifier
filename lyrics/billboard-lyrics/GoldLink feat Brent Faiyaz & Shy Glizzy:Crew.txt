She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man
But I was stunting all like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank

Bet against a real ass nigga with a sick ass mouth
And a slick ass flow
Catch-a-bullet-'round-me-nigga and a player when
I'm comin' for the kitty, I'm a fool, goddamn
Do it for my niggas in the ghost right there
Do it for my niggas in the ghost right now
Niggas got killed for the boy living dreams in the hills
And it wasn't for the boy right now
Goddamn, what a time, what a year
Feel what them young boys feel
I kill, never been killed, that's real, no lies
You can tell that from our pulse right now
Bet you wanna fuck me now
Bet you wanna love me down
Girl, you can't tie me down like Ray J said
Boy, no, I'm down
Trigger nigga show me something
Shake it like you owe me something
Pushin' on the pussy like a button
Came four times, fifth time you bustin'
Still gettin' rowdy in the function
Bitches on my dick like it's nothing
Everywhere I go now, always got shit pumpin', jumpin', pumpin', jumpin', yeah

Hey, nice to meet, I'm like "Hey, ay, who you be?"
Got the beast in Southeast, thousands clappin' to this beat
She invite me to her crib, I walk in she seem naive
She said "But I live in the hills, bitch, that's just the way I sleep"
Stop that madness, I'm a savage
In traffic with [?]
Brown bitch and she spanish
We get nasty, I'm right there
Does she know a nigga ain't average?
Ain't nothing wrong with fake assets
Bitch, turn up and let's make magic
I'm geekin', uh huh I'm on it
Don't look at me like you want it
Tell 'em that we ain't stuntin'
In fourth down we ain't puntin' it
Can't clock this Glock all on the cake
Come in without a permit
This shit really a jungle, real as an anaconda

She see money all around me
I look like I'm the man
But I was stunting all like last week
Tell me where have you been?
You came out of hiding, girl
Don't act like I'm your man
You just a fan, you don't hold rank
Don't hold no rank
