This-Way:Dilated Peoples feat Kanye West:22:2004-06-05

Now turn it up
(A little louder)
Turn it up
(A little louder)
Turn it up
(A little louder)
Turn it up
(A little louder)
Now turn it up
(Can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(A little louder)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live)
Now turn it up, turn it up
(A little louder)

Yo I can't live my I, I can't live my
Life this way, continually really get high
Instead of runnin' 'round, lock one bird down
It's a new day gotta do it big just to get right

Show no respect, can't live that way
You hold my check, can't live that way
Without my chick on deck, can't live that way
They say what they like, but I've been that way

Our moves calculated through the limbs, almost here
Succes will be the best revenge
Man, from Clint East' to Kanye West
The sun can't chill but everyday it sets

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's thing in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight

(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

(Can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

Yeah yeah, Kanye Chedda
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me, "Now, she a Christian"
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a sixth man

I'm in the club doin' the same ol' two step
While Omegas doin the same ol' "Q" step
I have my money on my mind I was thinkin' green
She a pledge A.K.A., "She was pink and green"

I wanna a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game I was scrimaging
My penmanship's so hard it needs censorship

I'ma Chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one, the other's gettin' away
This way

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's thing in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight

(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

(Can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

Here we go [Incomprehensible]
Go 'head! Flip a coin so the game can start
Believe I know the drama, kid name the part
I learnt before the hot flame came the spark
It's like before the pop fame came to 'Pac

But this industry will play with your life man
They playin' with your rent, food, water and lights man
That's why Rakaa brings it like that ol' Toddy Tee jam
'The Batterram', then I'm off to Amsterdam

To rest up for strength to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals to deal with this hate
I dedicate this Jam Master Jay
Run D.M.C. showed me how to walk, this way

This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my prime
I know there's thing in my life
That I'ma let go startin' tonight

(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

(Can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
This way, I can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my life this way

This way, this way
This way, this way
This way, this way
This way
