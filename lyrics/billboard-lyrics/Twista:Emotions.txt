Let me play with your emotions

Well, a motherfucker could never control me
Only squeeze me and hold me
That's what the hoe came up and told me, now is she bold G?
But in my mouth is where the gold be 'cause I be pimpin' her like Goldie

Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made
Just to be choppin' up confetti with, if it's already thick
You better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it
'Cause I ain't even on that petty shit, so who the fuck do I compete with?

The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic
Pick 'em up quick and then give em the dick, thinkin' I'm innocent
They up in the mall shoppin' for me pickin' a fit
I got them Heifer's nose red

And when we get in the bed, I be leavin' em with rose legs
Stuffin' that made 'em wanna pose dead
But you already got 'em until you get up in them hoes head
I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin'

But it's the bomb when I be havin' them cuties thinkin'
I'm in love with 'em, when I'm rubbin' 'em
Be gettin' pub with 'em, in a club with 'em
Smokin' dub with 'em, huggin' 'em, freakin' in the tub with 'em

After gettin' paid from her she ain't trippin'
'Cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go
Now we speakin' with the game on ways to make mo'

Let me play with your emotions hoe
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that, tell me baby can you buy that?
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that

Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that

Now how the fuck you gon act hoe, I saw you creepin' out the back do'
What you runnin' from a mack fo' ? Lay you on your back slow
'Cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afro, come and take a glimpse of the stairs

It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didn't notice then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin' women under my spell

Like I'm up in their brain, pumpin' their vein
With game for the anatomy that's feminine
They're fillin' 'em up with adrenaline, got 'em geekin'
We're speakin approachin' up a pimp like a gentleman

Submission is surrenderin', it ain't no endin'
If it's on with a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place, with the right mind and the right line
You can get a lifetime contract

They be wise until they look into your eyes
A shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind
Then she signed on the dotted-line

The hoe was like, "Ooh Daddy, why you doin' me like this?
I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head"
Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin' you for every penny you earn
Then how could you still show the bastard love?

I guess it's 'cause I'm cold, shit
Thought you was gon' be spendin' me I betcha think you sho' did
But game recognize game, now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin' to gold dig, now

Let me play with your emotions hoe
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that, tell me baby can you buy that?
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that

Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin' it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul, I should make your funky emotions
Nothin' is good unless you play with it, play with me baby

I know you think it's blasphemy
But won't you give up when she ask for me after he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Majesty, I had to see
And when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy?

That I can get her so gone, the hoe be trippin talkin' up her love a lot
But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin' like I wanna hug the Glock
Or when I rub the twat, or pickin' up a dub at spots
Fuck the hoe thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes

The speed knots match Voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin' with 'em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
So keep walkin' the next time you hear grown folks talkin'

Motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up
'Cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the Filet Minion, the Gray Poupon

Them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb
Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone
And let me pull my pouch of snuff in between your thighs
Come take a pull and vibe and let your tongue go coastin' low, now

Let me play, with your emotions hoe
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that, tell me baby can you buy that?
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that

Can I play, ooh, all I wanna do girl
Is play with your emotions
