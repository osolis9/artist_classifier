Homecoming:Kanye West feat Chris Martin:15:2008-07-19

Yeah
And you say Chi City
Chi City, Chi City

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Wendy and I like to blow trees"

And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from outta town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their act 'cause she know they soft

And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime my face lit up, so astoundin'
And I told her in my heart is where she always be
She never mess with entertainers 'cause they always leave

She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess it's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "Ye
Keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"

(I'm comin' home again)
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we could start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport
To follow your dream, sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' about me

She said, "You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new"

Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess this is why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home

Every interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
And if you don't know by now, I'm talkin' about Chi Town

(I'm comin' home again)
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again

Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again
Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again, maybe we could start again

Loyee, oyee, oh, loyee, oyee, oh
Comin' home again
Loyee, oyee, oh, loyee, oyee, oh
Comin' home again
Maybe we could start again
