Club-Can-t-Handle-Me:Flo Rida feat David Guetta:12:2010-12-18

You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
The club can't even handle me right now
I own the night, and I don't need no help

Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stuntin', go wild can't handle this player
Life of the club, arrogant like, yeah
Top like money, so the girls just melt
Want too many, all know me like Twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin' on chairs
Fall out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out so much attention
Scream out, "I'm in the building"
They watchin', I know this
I'm rockin', I'm rolling
I'm holding, I know it
You know it
You know I know how

To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out

The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
The club can't even handle me right now

Still feelin' myself, I'm like outta control
Can't stop now, more shots, let's go

Ten more rounds, can I get a K.O.?
Paparazzi trying to make me pose
Came to party 'til I came no more
Celebrate 'cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin' off their clothes
Grand finale like Superbowl
Go hard, run the show
That's right, while I've got money to blow
More lights, more ice when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
I said it, go tell it
Confetti, who ready?
I'm ready, you ready
Let's get it
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out

The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)

(Put your hands up)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
You got me watchin' now, got my attention now
Got everybody in the club wanting to know now
I am a ladies man, come be my lady and

We can ball, so, ah
Bring ya body here, let me switch up your atmosphere
Take you up out of the club and up in my new limo
Fly you all around the world

What you want baby girl, are you ready to go now?
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
(Put your hands up)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Put your hands up)
(Let's celebrate now)
(Put your hands up)
(You know who shut it down)
