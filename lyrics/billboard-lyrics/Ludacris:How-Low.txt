How-Low:Ludacris:2:2010-05-15

(*Prod. by T-Minus)


[Hook:]*
How low can you go? (8x)

[Ludacris:]
Luda!
She could go lower than I ever really thought she could,
Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans,
Baby pull your pants up,
I like it when I see you do it,
Better then I ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama’s ever seen it in her life time,
Never would’ve imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause I can’t get wit ya ya just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,
Then I might show you girls a thang or 2,
Yea I think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
There's just 1 thing I gotta know

[Repeat Chorus:]

How low can you go? (8x)

I could go low, (Go low) lower than you know,
Go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low, (go low) lower than you know,

[Luda:]
I be like Nick-nac-paddywac,
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone,
How many licks does it takes till i get to the center and let a realer n-gga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin low then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on TV,
Cos I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,
Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,
I love how they seen to please us,
I wanna taste them butterican pican peanut buttercups like reeses pieces,
Cause I think you a superstar,
With a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
Well there just 1 thing I gotta know,

[Repeat Hook:]
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Ludacris:]
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it,
Don’t stop, (Get it, get it)
Put it on reverse just to rack it up,
Let me put some Luda in it,
Show me what you workin wit,
I’ll show you some of this bank roll,
Yea you a superstar but theres 1 thing I gotta know though,

[Repeat Hook:]
[Repeat Chorus:]
