Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like "watch out"
Got it too lit like "pipe down"
No I can't wait need it right now
Get guap only ones, what she like now
Count it up from the morning to the night now
That's the reason that niggas wanna fight now
Look at my diamonds, shine like a lighthouse
Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like "watch out"

Breath in, breath in, breath in
