Sad to say I'm only in town for the night ya see
I got like 8 hours left before my flight look here
Hey yo I'm tryin' to stay respectful and polite
Now you can tell me â€~go to hell' if ya like

Now I ain't one of them ****** that wanna trip
Get mad â€~cause you ain't interested, he yellin' **** *** *****
Now don't get it twisted, yeah I'ma look when you pass
But I ain't the one to pull on your arm or grab your ***

Ya see it's the swagger, it won't allow me lookin' thirst
And I ain't attackin' unless I get a signal first
And I ain't the one that's gon' be payin' to do the do
Before it's over you gon' say, â€½Sh**, I should pay youâ€
Please believe it

But ya say you got a lame lame *****  in your life
And he can't get the mental and physical part right

You playin' wit ya toys but ya toys don't bite
See they don't talk **** and they don't hit it how you like
See I just want the first right of refusal when you catch the mood
Just call and I come through and sock it to you, promise you booboo

He said he got the magic stick, well ma my sh** is like voodoo
That there stay harder than a rodeo you can ride like Isuzu
But all you need is your leather boots, we ridin' in birthday suits
My time is movin' fast, so that's why I ask ya
