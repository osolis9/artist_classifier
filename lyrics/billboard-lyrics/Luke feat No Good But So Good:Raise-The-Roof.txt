What time is it?
Booty time

Let's go
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, let's go

Come on, y'all it's a big booty party, get all y'all, day in day
Chillin' in the M to the I to the A, makin' hits with Luke this way
Burn the roof downtown[Incomprehensible]up
If ya feel me just pump your fists up
Left side, right side, what's up, put them legs up, wanna' be change up

Biggest stars show up out to the beat
Federal track got more game than the Heat
Get with that and I'ma get with this
If you need to bite something playa bite this

Don't say [Incomprehensible]how ya feel
Now like a pimp talkin' out, comin' here
South side ready to get loose
[Incomprehensible]pump ya fists and just raise the roof

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there

Throw your hands in the air, big booty girls, shake your darria
And the place gonna' see one, I see y'all playa's representing over there
And what about New York, Foxy Brown, you know that we get down
T nasty in the house and we don't quit
This and that girls move your ass pump ya fists

Little Kim and NGBG, pump ya fists in the air if you're with me
One time for Salt N Pepa, Luke breaks express, gets so better
Can't leave out the dirty south, Phatlanta and the Brat
That's what I'm tallin' about, so if you can hear me
All across the world let me see you pump your fists

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof

What time is it? Booty time
What time is it? Booty time
What time is it? Booty, booty, booty time

What time is it? Booty time
What time is it? Booty time
What time is it? Booty, booty, booty time

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there

Time to get high, ride down I95, might see me at Iny

[Incomprehensible]take a trip where they go, Cay club Chicago
Ain't no tellin' where I might be, Huston, Texas or D.C.

Red Roper Fayetteville, Cap D get ill
East side New York, Funk Master Flex, get back
South side bama 9, West coast, show me love
For bound west in the G-club, uncle Luke get loose

Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
Raise the roof, put 'em up there
