Pullin-Up:Meek Mill feat The Weeknd:25:2015-07-25

We wanted the world baby

That's why we ended how we ended
We chose to live how we live
Well now you found the one, baby
And you ain't tryna see nobody but him
Nobody but him
Ooh, ooh
But I know you well
Ooh, ooh

Girl I know you well
Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin' up

Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin' up

When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
Pull up on you, put it on you

Fuck you in the car, if he looking for you
Seen you with your man and said "what up to ya"
Like you ain't give me that work
It was California 5 in the morning
I was plotting on ya, we was hot as suana
Tryna pop up on ya and fuck you good on that Purp
We linking up getting faded
We fell in love and we made it
We only fucked we never never dated
Come get your lady
Holla she told me she skated
That pussy was good as Crustaceans
I'm in the latest
She ride the D like Mercedes
I might just call her Mercedes
Rocking margiela I might just design like a mason
Don't tell nobody you my baby
She fell in love with the real
Now she don't fuck with the fakers
Me and her nigga was sharing a home
I'm talking like Clippers and Lakers
And she get the D from a favorite
That pussy got me going crazy

I know that these niggas gon' hate it
But we only trip when we trip to Jamaica
Just tell â€˜em

Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin' up

Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up
Pullin' up on that new thang

Muse and my boo thang
And she's a dime like who's saying
And we kick shit, Liu Kang
A chun lii's only one me
I'm like Bun B how I screw things
Front stroke, back stroke
I came, you came
And your main nigga ain't fuckin' with me
He ain't fuckin' with me
Tell that nigga go wait inside
When I pull up on you, you coming with me
Talk dirty, you say its mines
You say its mine when I'm coming in it
Broke boys don't deserve pussy
Therefore, you ain't fucking with her
I'mma be there when that nigga get fly
Soon as he slippin, I'm making you mine
Buy you a rollie to make up for time
And flood it all out to make sure you shine girl
I'm never waiting in line, girl
Let me just take you my world
Soon as that nigga stop frontin' on you
You get the D from behind, girl
Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin' up
Tell your man to wait inside when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up
When I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up, when I'm pullin up
