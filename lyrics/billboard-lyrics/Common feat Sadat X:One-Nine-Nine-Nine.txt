One-Nine-Nine-Nine:Common feat Sadat X:4:1999-08-14

Dead Moon
Thirteen Off My Hook
I'm Out Nine
Runaway horses under my hood
Can't catch me when i fly
Blue sky over me, six feet under me
Touch me when you cry
I caught sight of you, i've got altitude
In my clouded eyes
Isn't that mainstream? finding you empty
Socially i'm out nine

Innocent highway, stranger than my way
Turn me like a page
Taken a wrong turn, deafly won't be heard
Damaged but i'm ok
Checking the chamber, nervous i came here
Looking through colored blinds
Careful don't miss me, going out easy
Socially i'm out nine
