O-Let-s-Do-It:Waka Flocka Flame:7:2010-05-15

[Verse 1]
I fucked my money up, damn
Now I can't re-up
Ran off in his spot just to get my stacks up
Now I'm back on deck, so shawty what the fuck you want
Heard he talkin shit but this ain't what the fuck he want
Locked my CEO up, now it's back to coka
Niggas talkin shit bruh, hang him by a ropa
Hit em with the choppa, call that shit hot lava
Call me waka flocka aka young wild nigga
Aka young drug dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills got white
In the trap all night with the hard and the soft
Stacks on the flo' make you wanna get with em
Shook it to the left then he shook it to the right
So icey brick boys got it all night

Kick in my door we gon shoot out all night
Home of he Braves shawty shoot em with a K
