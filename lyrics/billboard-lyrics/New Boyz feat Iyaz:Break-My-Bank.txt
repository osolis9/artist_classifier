Break-My-Bank:New Boyz feat Iyaz:10:2010-08-14

You make me wanna break my bank
Give everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot
Make it rain
Where my money at? Where my money at?

Break my bank
Forget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag
Make it rain
Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank

Damn, girl, you look better than the videos
Think I wanna break my bank, hammer to the piggie, though
All them groupie girls getting jealous of what I spendin'
Tryna chop it up, but I ain't the karate kid

Jaded, everyday I'm spending more on her
I don't buy shit, like I barely hold the door open
Every time I say this, it always get her one more
When it's time for taxes, a nigga gon' be done for

Break my bank
Give everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot
Make it rain
Where my money at? Where my money at?

Break my bank
Forget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag
Make it rain
Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank
Make me wanna break my, make me wanna break my bank

Okay, the start of my day, I took her on a date
Had to scrape for some change, so I went to the bank
But when I seen her, she was so damn fine like that
So I headed right back to pull a lot more stacks
Overdrawn, low funds

It's, it's like I'm dumb
But I put it right back 'cause your boy is sprung
Man she is so damn fine, got me spending all this cash
Man, it's going too fast, I need to watch my ass

You make me wanna break my bank
Give everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot
Make it rain
Where my money at? Where my money at?

Break my bank
Forget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag
Make it rain
Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank
Make me wanna break my, make me wanna break my

If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank
If you a bad girl, and you tryin' to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank

If you a bad girl, and you need a little change
Tell your man go break his bank
If you a bad girl, and you tryin' to get paid
Tell your man go break his bank

Break my bank
Give everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot
Make it rain
Where my money at? Where my money at?

Break my bank
Forget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag
Make it rain
Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank
Make me wanna break my, make me wanna break my bank
