Off thier debute album entitled, Worldwide, you know how we do
So if you have a dedication or request or a shoutout
You just wanna say ' what's up ', then holla

Let's get this party started tonight
Skwert Diggety makin' it hot

We steppin' on in and let cha jeep
Cause we flex the beat
It's Nadanuf all up in your stuff
You can't get enough
Cause everything we touch is not enough
Girl just too much
So, do you feel us?

Let us in your ride
Your crew deep inside
Nadanuf gets you high
Now you open wide

For the bump and grind
We got the kind to hit cha spine
Lay back, relax
So while we hit you in your jaw with news
So you can focus to us
So you can roll this to us
Nadanuf rollin' wit cha crew

'Till six in tha mornin' (we goin' rollin')
'bout we get on
Cause it ain't nuthin' wrong
Cause we 'bout to get it on
(say 4 x's)

Throw yo' hands in the air
All my true players (all my true players)
The party's over here

Pull it over, right, Drova
Got the platinum gold to take you home
Oh no, Here we go
To the next episode
See me flow
Keepin' rolls, slammin' doors, not enough
You want some mo' flow
But you don't here me though, huh?

We got you low down
As you roll to this sound
While puffin' on this pound
With my top down

'Till six A.M. way in
'till the party over anticipatin'
Haters still hatin'
Move over bacon
Now there's somethin' leaner
Here we come ya'll
Takin' over the arena

(repeat 4 x's)

Rollin' wit cha top down
Not enough wit dat sound, now
(say 3 x's)

Rollin' wit cha top down
Not enough wit dat real sound

Rollin' wit cha top down
Not enough wit dat sound, now
(say 3 x's)

Rollin' wit cha top down, chillin'

(repeat untill fade)

Cinncinati's right choice
This is Skwert Diggety (no doubt) up in your speakers
That was the latest one from Nadanuf
Off thier new album, Worldwide
You know how we do it
I got some more stuff to bump in your jeeps comin' up later on
But untill then, if you got a dedication, or request, or a shoutout
You just wanna say ' what's up, dawg ', then holla
