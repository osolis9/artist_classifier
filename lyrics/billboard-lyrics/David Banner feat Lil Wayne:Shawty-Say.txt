You don't come around her hair and throw that ass on the floor
You don't spend no time, you don't spend a little mind
And take her out to eat, man, you never treat her kind

Man, and I ain't even touched her
But another nigga will come through and gon' fuck her
You need to get yo' mind right
Man go an' raise your kids, put a man in they life

Uh, or I'ma put it in your wife
Man I'm trying tell you what the broad said last night
"He don't stick it, he don't licky licky
He don't take me out to the movies or buy the Lakers tickets"

I parked in the spot, gal asked me my name
I looked back at her and I said T-Pain
I bought her a drink, she said she was a stripper
I'm making more than money, like real so I tip her

Now she grabbing on my zipper, you know what happen next
She say you don't listen to her life and the stress
Word to the wise, go an' keep ya trick
You know your old lady, she gon' get it how she lives

Now this is for my ladies looking good in the club
If that nigga ain't shit girl, go an' throw it up
And you can't do this and you don't do that
There's some niggas like me waiting for ya in the back
