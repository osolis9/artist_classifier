Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Hell naw, ain't leavin' me alone, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl

Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Hell naw, ain't leavin' me alone, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl

She's got that sweat drippin' all over her body
Do you like that sweat drippin' all over my body?
Yeah, I like that sweat drippin' all over your body
You like that sweat drippin' all over my body

It's summertime and I'm back again
And went to VA, oh and got my friends
Say what's up, Pharrell?
These motherfuckers now
Yeah but, let's show 'em what's above the nail, bling

A hundred thou couldn't get you one of these
I guarantee it ain't a flaw on one of these
Two hundred thou, couldn't get you in the league
Get three hundred thou, you couldn't even buy the keys

I think you need to add 50 more G's
Now, shall I proceed?
Yes, indeed
Ho

I need to see you take it down to the floor
Spread your wings, if you real Ma, fly real low
Pause for a second Ma, grind real slow
And if you do it right all day we'll go
Ho

I talk a lil' Fred Seigal girl
Bonnie and Judy Lee with your bag all beaded, girl
Apple bottom pair underneath it
You talkin' like you don't need it
I can tell you see it

I like that in you, I don't see nothin' wrong
Drop down and get your eagle on
Woah

Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Hell naw, ain't leavin' me alone, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl

Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Hell naw, ain't leavin' me alone, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl

She's got that sweat drippin' all over her body
Do you like that sweat drippin' all over my body?
Yeah, I like that sweat drippin' all over your body
You like that sweat drippin' all over my body

Now, what's next to trenscend up in this party
OPP time, now let's get naughty
You take baby girl and I'ma take shorty
With the sweat drippin all over her body

We gone move if you wanna, groove if you wanna
Throw your nose up Ma, and get rude if you wanna
Ain't got nothin' to lose, nor to prove
Baby girl, soaked like she just got out of the pool

I know you're thirsty Ma, go ahead and order whatchu want
Some call it trickin, go ahead and call it whatchu want
I came to ball, I ain't come out here to front
'Cause the black card will pick-up what the gray card won't

Her attractiveness got me attackin' this
I'm so fabulous, glutious maximus
She wanna fly south for the winter
I might just go down south just to win her

Hell naw, she ain't gone leave me alone
Makin' plans for us to be at home
Take your pants off Ma, you can leave your panties on
But, first drop down and get your eagle on
Oh

Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Hell naw, ain't leavin' me alone, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl

Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Hell naw, ain't leavin' me alone, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl

She's got that sweat drippin' all over her body
Do you like that sweat drippin' all over my body?
Yeah, I like that sweat drippin' all over your body
You like that sweat drippin' all over my body

From the girls with skinny waists, to girls heavy set
Come on
Flap your wings
Come on
Flap your wings

To the girls with extensions, to the girls with dreads
Come on
Flap your wings
Come on
Flap your wings

From the girls got it good livin' in the suburbs
Come on
Flap your wings
Come on
Flap your wings

To the one's in the ghetto with their hands on their curves
Come on
Flap your wings
Come on
Flap your wings
Oh

Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
Hell naw, ain't leavin' me alone, girl
Drop down and get your eagle on, girl
