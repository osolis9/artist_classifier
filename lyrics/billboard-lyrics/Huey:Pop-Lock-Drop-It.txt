Pop-Lock-Drop-It:Huey:2:2007-07-21

Toot that thang up, mommy, make it roll
Once you pop, pop, lock it for me, girl, get low
If yo' mama gave it to you, baby girl, let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me, maybe we can roll (Oh)
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Tonight, it's gon' be some changes
No acting sadity
So stop acting and get it clappin'
'Cause I'm knowing you feeling me
Yeah, you cute
But don't let that shit go to yo' head
'Cause what this cutie won't do
Pimpin' another one will
You prepared, rockin' a skirt
And ya heels so tall
And we ain't wit' none of that tricking, but our bills so tall
I been peepin' you fo' a while, and you throwin' it back
If you lookin' fo' you a balla, we got dough in da back
Look, yo' color caramel brown
And yo' skin so smooth
I'm havin' fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undercover freak
You probably thinking da same
I'm seein' light up on yo' face because you peepin' my chain
And I ain't tryin' a put you out there as if you a freak
So don't even take it that way; jus' say you did it fo' me
And, yeah, you probably roll wit' me 'cause it's money in my pockets
So before then I gotta see you pop, lock and drop it
Toot that thang up, mommy, make it roll
Once you pop, pop, lock it for me, girl, get low
If yo' mama gave it to you, baby girl, let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me, maybe we can roll (Oh)
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
I ain't gotta be yo' man
But I really wouldn't mind
We ain't got to talk again
I'm jus' tryin' a have a time
If you a balla, pull a stack out, and smack her on da ay
Pop, lockin', cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mommy get low
Give her space, let her sweat
The club turnin' to hoolas 'cause they shirts is so wet
From da window to da wall
Lil' mama showin' her thong
The broad freakin' herself; it's tellin' me that it's on
You ready, then we can roll; I'm tellin' you we can go
I'm thinkin' if I can handle it, the way you make it roll
You groovin' and speedin' up
You right in between us
If you a strip teasa, then baby, don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin'
But my vision gettin' clearer
You moving that thang around as if you practice in da mirror
She doin' a new dance
What the next man said
I'm like, naw; she just pop locking on a headstand
Toot that thang up, mommy, make it roll
Once you pop, pop, lock it for me, girl, get low
If yo' mama gave it to you, baby girl, let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me, maybe we can roll (Oh)
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Make it roll to da left (Left)
Roll to da right (Right)
Pop, lock and drop it; get low, a'ight
Make it roll to da left (Left)
Roll to da right (Right)
Pop, lock and drop it; get low, a'ight
It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it, but I ain't givin'
Just bounce it and roll wit' it, and maybe you roll wit' us
It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it, and I ain't givin'
Just bounce it and roll wit' it, and maybe you roll wit' us
Pop, lock and drop it
Now pop, lock and drop it fo' me
Pop, lock and drop it
Say pop, lock and drop it
What's yo' name, girl?
Neva mind, neva mind
Do you thang, girl
Fire, you ain't neva lied
What's yo' name, girl?
Neva mind, neva mind
Do you thang, girl
Fire, you ain't neva lied a'ight! (Oh)
