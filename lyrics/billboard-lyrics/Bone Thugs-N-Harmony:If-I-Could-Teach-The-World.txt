If-I-Could-Teach-The-World:Bone Thugs-N-Harmony:3:1998-02-21

Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high (high high high)
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high (high high high)
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high (high high high)
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high (high high high)

If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
to be a thug in harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
to be a thugster just like me (like me)
If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
to be a thug in harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
to be a thugster just like me (like me)

How many more day's on this old earth, can you see it's a crime to me
So we should get ready for Armageddon, 'cause I know God should be
Ready to roll, and do away with the wickedest shit like Mr. Policeman
And dog if you with it then pump up your fist in the air and pray for the politicians freely
Get an amen, the last days of the last days

An' that's why I get high
An' that's why I get high

I'm holdin' on to my soul, but nobody knows and when it all unfolds
And then when I go, go, remember the days 'cause all that I get I get on my own with Bone
Bone, Bone, muggin', thuggin' through your door
Hoes speakin' of the last day, it's on when I'm past at trail, but what do you know
But I can't go wrong when I kick it with my song and turn it up
'Cause you love that thuggish, ruggish, bone, bone, bone

Crossroads, wanna rule the world, no I don't 'cause too many of us lost those
Who meant so much, why wasn't I chose
But it will not stop Bone, those shots don't drop Bone
No-ooh, oh, no

And if I could teach the world to be a thug like me
Then they probably be thuggin' in heaven eternally

Every day the world goes round and round, I see it's a small world after all
'Cause I go meet and I greet with my fans, smoke a little weed and have a little laugh with y'all
But every now and then, I gets caught up in a playa hation
Lord, whats wrong with this nation, erase 'em

But if I could teach the world to be a thug just like me
You could live your lifestyle worry-free in the arms of the Lord eternally
No mystery, but check the essence of a story
A warrior, Wasteland Warrior so true

Divine, it's mine, East 1999
Is where your findin' all of my kind, every time

If I could teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thug in harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thugster just like me (like me)
If I could teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thug in harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thugster just like me (like me)

(If I, if I) We stand as united, but fall if divided
My thugs is the tightest, 'cause God is our guide
But they only define us, as killers and fighters
The critics and writers, backstab when they typin' our story

The war to be warrior that's for sure
And as thugs, we more more more

I got, we got, to much shit to give, got shit to give
Especially, but still understood by older folk, and little kids
Common, all o' y'all follow me
Bone way to go, we know the way to go
Follow me, follow me, Bone

And that's why I stay high, 'cause I got shit to deal with
The government and these playa hatas out to kill Wish, wanna hurt this
But uh-uh, I got true Mo Thug niggaz you just can't fuck with
Artillery you just can come with, nigga better let it rest, shit

To the little boys and girls all over the world
This shit that we say is for the streets, not for you go and do
Or to repeat, please, if we can no more murder
How must I say it, if we can no more murder

If I could teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thug in harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thugster just like me (like me)
If I could teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thug in harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world) to be a thugster just like me (like me)

Why do I stay high
