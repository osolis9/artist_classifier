Diamonds-feat-Dana-Williams-:Freddie Gibbs
[Prelude]
Had to get that pitch on a bitch
Smack it up, flip it, and rub it down

[Hook]
Cause I be grindin', GP full of diamonds
Grindin', wrist be changing climate
And there she go, nigga
I bet she go, nigga

[Verse 1]
Cause I be grindin', GP full of diamonds
See these bitches blinded, wrist be changing climate
It be that thang about the lines and
Side to side and from behind it
Bitch, I choose to put two bitches
On my line and nevermind it
I be movin', drink and drug abusin'
Yeah, smoked out, could fear the flute, but I'm coolin'
Yeah, got that backwood feeling strong and I'm loaded
Yeah, got a pack and a gang, I'm strapped for my soldiers
Yeah
I remember them nights when a nigga couldn't eat that much
Truth be told that these groupie hoes
They used to turn their nose, they wouldn't give no fucks
Cars are black, I'm down, pull the 'Lac around
Bust dick a behind tint
Nigga, I was born with no windows and a pot to piss
That's why I'm repping that, nigga, can't tell me shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cause I be grindin', GP full of diamonds
Need to claim your ho, entertain your ho
Where your bitch? Can't find her?
Giving answers back, sending nasty texts
She with the VVS straight blinded
White girl and a Mexican
They both get naked then I turned them out on that powder
And I be rollin', what y'all niggas smokin'?
They be shuck-and-jivin', now it's I-fivin'
Got the killa pack from East Oakland[]
So I sent my bitch a load told the bitch to go drop it off, head shopping
Used to wait for niggas, had the 'caine for niggas
There's some killers at your door knocking, nigga, I got 'em
I remember them nights when a nigga had to rob to stay afloat
Niggas from the other side was at my throat
Met my homeboy [?] slanging dough
Niggas trying to live straight, legit
Got a bird from the H trying to rock your bitch
Nigga came from a crumb to a motherfuckin' brick
So a rapping-ass nigga can't tell me shit
