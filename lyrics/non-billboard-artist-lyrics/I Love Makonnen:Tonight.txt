Tonight:I Love Makonnen
[Verse]
I've been thinking about you doing the things that you do in Atlanta
There's no girls like you. They don't dance the way that you do
But I, I think that you should be right here next to me
Like you said you would

[Hook]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
So I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me, Brianna
So I've been cheating too tonight

Tonight [x5]

[Verse]
You've been doing these things that you really don't like, I'm saying
You just changed your jeans so you can be with them Flights
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight in Atlanta
There's no girls like you, they don't dance the way that you do, in Atlanta
There's no girls like you, they don't dance the way that you do
But I, I think that you should be right here next to me
Like you said you would, but

Tonight [x4]
Tonight, Brianna

[Pre-hook]
...doing that you do in Atlanta
There's no girls like you, they don't dance the way that you do
And I, I think that you should be right here next to me
Like you said you would, but

I've made this for you
