Trust-No-Bitch:Penthouse Players Clique
(feat. AMG, DJ Quik, Eazy-E)

[DJ Quik]
Yes i'm too smart to get dicked, ah so the case may be
That's how the ho felt when she found out that she couldn't play me
I know the game and I know it rather swell
To rubbin up on my dick & given me hints that you ? as well
You figgure first kiss my lips & rub my hips then you take a sip
Of Hennesy hit the budda pass out and i'll take the strip
Hell naw monkey mouth trick, ya stupid ho
You must be a fool if you thinkin that I don't know
But naw you broke ass hoes be tryna come up, shakin that money maker
But I brake her cuz the bitch is a faker
Or maybe she just don't know the formula, of how to get rich quik
Without havin to make ? the dick
That all a bitch know, is how to be a mega ho
I guess it just goes to show that shes to ignorant to know
That I won't be played, or ganked or gaffled but I ain't perfect
I woop the dick out every know and then and let em slurp it
But i'm careful bein aware of the bitches
That's chargining niggaz on purpose cuz they think they deserve it
Yeah that's some cold shit, my experince oughtta learn ya
That if a nigga ain't tryna smoke ya a bitch tryna burn ya, so trust no

[chrous x2: DJ Quik] [mixing, mixes]
Trust no bitch, punk bitches
Trust no (ho) funky cock hoes

[Playa Hamm]
I refuse to loose so I choose few and trust none
See my ladies I love, but to you bitches I ain't the one
When I tell you to trust no bitch, it might not occur to you
Females ain't the only bitches that i'm reffering to
See you can't help a bitch, let alone treat swell a bitch
Cuz a bitch sold out, gone sell out or the bitch gone snitch
Bitches wanna be & always go be around
Watching what you do, tryna use you and keep you down
Playa Hamm ain't gone boil with a story you got ya own
I'ma strength in your condition to get a dogg a bone
And move own till a muthaphukka fake you, fuck you
And make you take they punk bitch ass to the bank fool
See bitches get paid, see bitches got charm
I see em all at the mall, on tv & on my homies arm
See some of my homies got bitches, but we breakin bitches homie
So I come like this bitch, act like you know

[chrous x2: DJ Quik]

[Eazy-E]
Eazy-E the muthaphukkin mininpulator, when it comes to pussy hoes
Just watch how my dick rolls
But since all hoes fall in the bitch catagorey
Trustin no hooker ass bitches its mandatorey
How much do you you want bitch, how much can you take
Cuz a nigga like tha E you can't brake
With that skinny little ass in my face and i'll slap it
Whip out my dick and let you lick before I tap it
My left hands on your ass, my right hands on your head
Cuz bitches get the nut and niggas get the leg
Suckin my dick, lickin my balls you make me come faster
Suckin my toes, lickin my ass you know you are the master
Now you just won't stop
Suckin everybody's dick cuz it's good till the last drop
But that shit won't phase me
I trust no car wreckin bitch, this ones for you tracey

[AMG]
Pussy ain't nuthin but a hoe that at nine do
So i'd rather make a meal while i'm flippin the cold crews
Bitches ain't shit, word to the diggy diggy dick
Eazy-E, PPC, AMG & Quik
Bitch I ain't +Babyface+ so save ya +Whip Appeal+
I never go on dates with broke bitches get free meals
I'm supposed to pay the way ? who pay deals
Bitch please you betta hit the knees, or you can even youch ya toes
Cuz i'm still playin ya'll punk hoes like dominoes
And if you suck the dick right and the pussys tight
I might not beat you down until the second night
Once a dog always a dog bitch
You little trick, tramp, slut with the big but
Cuz you ain't shit bitch
I'd rather fuck you than love you
Bitch I never trust ya
