Chasing-James-Dean:Kail
he don't know where to begin
he cant seem to win for losing
its all so familiar now
hearts drunk and broken down
gotta pocket full of hell and a plan for the weekend

say now
sometimes youll dance for the devil my son
its hard to make the music start
just me james dean and a man who loves both
live fast die young
dont ever stay blue

jah never rescues a man
aint no man a livin gonna make it make sense
its hard to believe it now
couldnt see him reachin out
bet ill never let another one slip through my hands

didnt ever really live in the end
broken mans hole
and a wall full of demons
not a single tear he cried
just a boy drunk with pride
just mr hemingway and a shotgun applied (reply?)
