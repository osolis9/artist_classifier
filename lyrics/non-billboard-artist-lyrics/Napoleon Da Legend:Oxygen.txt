Oxygen:Napoleon Da Legend
feat. Raekwon


No ransom!
Sometimes like
you know what I mean
Is like, is like I'm walking in constant darkness man
Is like I can't breath, like, like the walls are caving in,
You know what I mean?
I need oxygen, you know what I mean?

..pride for the...
Laugh in the flesh... make it better
Under the circumstances...
..no person can understand them
Search for answers at the bottom...
Meditating in front of mammy's...
.. grind for a living
...I can move on my decision
Good living against the... like a ... finish
Follow false prophets...
In the perfect world, Napoleon would be the...
... and a son that makes preparations that...
...pharmaceuticals wanna drug us
Black .. bluffing, get it when I want some
The game is ... like...
Got the best of both worlds like I'm...
Fuck it!
...a manifesto for the mafia
..what seems .. you can check my....
Legends of... flex my muscles and then I stop
Lost in insomnia, demons keep me up in night
Still alive to spit a song, I must be doing something right!

Chorus: (x2)
Oxygen for myself, I'm suffocating
Left... in the darkness...
Every time my life lost another one begins...
Breathing in...

Hey, yow
Chef what's up?
Napoleon was gone, nigger?
Nobody know me, some ransom going on, nigger
Niggers gotta pay us, nigger!
I that's what it is!

..can say a lot, making a movie, baby
Hunchback, hunch in this shit, ...
Gucci clean along, be the one gun...
Fuck young niggers, you're jumping the...
From the... niggers spend the..
Word to my momma, you're...
... niggers, dressed up, blue Bugattis
The bridge is ..
Jumping the tuxedos in front and...
who get the...
Who eat a lot of papers...
Bluish cables, silly...
The cold quest, the gold gets touched
Times fly around...
You can see me at airmax,.. in the new shit..
...no fucked around, get thrown in the screen, nigger!

Chorus: (x2)
Oxygen for myself, I'm suffocating
Left... in the darkness...
Every time my life lost another one begins...
Breathing in...
