Problems:King George
We Got Us Some Problems,
And I'm Thinkin Twice,
Prominence Murder,
To Follow Your Eyes,
This Shit Is A Movie,
You Got Me Tongue-Tied,
Caught In The Middle,
Of All The Shit In Your Life,

Is You Ridin Yourself?
Slobber You Up If You Need No Time.
You and All These Hoes In Here.
Got 100 Things On Me,
But I Ain't Talking Bout You,
Crazy, Crazy
Girl I'm Just Sayin, Sayin
The Chance That You Takin Takin
Ooh Girl On The Real I Wanna,
Roll, I Wanna Play With
Girl I Be Gone, Like I was Faded
Tell Him Get Lost,
That Nigga Basic,
Don't You Got A Song With No Blazement.
And If I Was In It Would You Say Shit?
I'm Caught In The Middle,
Of All The Shit In Your Life
But You Coming Along,

You Could Call If You Need Anything

We Got Us Some Problems,
And I'm Thinkin Twice,
Prominence Murder,
To Follow Your Eyes,
This Shit Is A Movie,
You Got Me Tongue-Tied,

Caught In The Middle,
Of All The Shit In Your Life,

Sometimes Me and You Wanna Get Away,
Sometimes, I Wanna Buy You A Drank
All The Time, I Got Love For You, Love For You Baby
All The Time, I Got Love For You, Love For You Baby
Talkin Bout You
Crazy, Crazy
Girl I'm Just
Sayin, Sayin
The Chances That You
Takin, Takin
Ooh Girl On The Real
I Wanna Roll,
I Wanna Play With.

Sometimes, Me and You Just Wanna Get Away

Sometimes, Sometimes I Wanna Buy You A Drank
All The Time Got Love For You, Love For You Baby
All The Time Got Love For You Love For You...
