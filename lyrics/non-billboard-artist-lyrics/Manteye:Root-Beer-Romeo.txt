Root-Beer-Romeo:Manteye
I Press My Clothes
And I Comb Back My Hair
I Look As Good A I Can
With What I Got
There's Nothing Better To Wear
And I Go Out
Where You Work In The Soda Shop
Honey,I'd Lie Down With The Devil
Just To Wake Up With An Angel
But I'll Never Get Anywhere
Sucking On Soda Pop.
Cause I'm A Root Beer Romeo
I Only Dance When The Dance Is Slow
Yea I'm A Root Beer Romeo
I Need A Woman, Not A Burger To Go, No, No, No.
Now I Say Yes
And You Say No
Yet We Sit Here Tonight On The Old Man's Couch
With The Lights Down Low
And I Freeze Up
'Cause You Cooled Me Down
By The Time We Get Close To The Thrill Of It All
It Will Be To Late
We'll Be Running Out Of Soda Pop.
'Cause I'm A Root Beer Romeo
I Only Dance When The Dance Is Slow
Yea I'm A Root Beer Romeo
I Need A Woman, Not A Burger To Go, No, No, No.
And I Got A Little Money Babe
And I Got A Lot Of Energy
And We Could Spend The Whole Night Talking About
The Way Things Could Be
Or Do Something About It Right Now.
Cause I'm A Root Beer Romeo
Root Beer Romeo
I Only Dance When The Dance Is Slow
Yea I'm A Root Beer Romeo
Root Beer Romeo
I Need A Woman, Not A Burger To Go. Yea, Yea, Yea, No, No, No.
