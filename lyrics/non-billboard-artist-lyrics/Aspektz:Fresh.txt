Fresh:Aspektz
So new, so cool
Take it back, the future the old school

Addicted to gettin fresh, Addicted to gettin fresh!
Addicted to gettin fresh, Addicted to gettin fresh!
Addicted to gettin fresh, Addicted to gettin fresh!
Addicted to gettin fresh, Addicted to gettin fresh!

Like baby I'm takin off
Ill be gone for a while
Like shorty I'm taking off
Got that getaway style
Like baby I'm takin off
Ye you know I got nex
Like shorty I'm takin off
Addicted to gettin fresh

Been in bed two weeks, fresh kicking it
Rippin thru catalogs, burnin dead presidents
Got direct connects forget middlemen
(Addicted to getting fresh) even Grandma singing it
Worldwide flow in a custom made suit
Opa, say cheers clink your champagne - flute
Old heads say Aspektz the truth
Cause the Boardroom Bully got the game in a - noose
(Tried to tell em) save your breath, no use
I'm fresh - got your girl tryna squeeze out my juice
Get loose - we don't throw 'bows no more
Shotglass of Nuvo - like ugh forget Goose
We off that, like drizzy and J hov said
Tax time flow every bars goin overheads
Can't front girl you're flyer than the rest
You can be my paul bearer cause I'm fresh to death

So clean from my shades to my socks
Got Shox so fresh that they haven't left the box
Fresh girl, my ex I kinda miss ner
Plus I'm thoro and when you this big, they call you mister
Spending gucci lucci so icy
True Thorobredz wristband match the Nikes
Sabataj puttin glitter on his chick
See so many c notes she gon be sea - sick
My new girl lookin ill in them fittedteds
Til she switch it business caj and get articulate
Armani money but no exchanging
Living my life in XS feels amazin
Put you on notice - I been noticin
You notice me so its mutual baby
Mr Thoro got my feet up on the desk
Screamin whoomp there it is, addicted to gettin fresh, go!

Fresh day and a fresh outlook too
Got a french maid but I'm pretty sure she cooks too
"Common sa va?" like girl you're so special
After the breakfast in bed we'll sip that XO
Feelin swivelled next step I'm getting fresh with you
Better put that little red X on your messenger
Fresh digits tell your ladies
Stop callin a-s-p-e-k-t-z
Fresh start, nope not planting seeds
But that fetti fresh printed, fresh off a money tree
Turn it up let the bassline ricochet
Mr Thoro went ahead and teamed up with Triple A
Spend big tryna slow my momentum
But it seems to happen in crescendo
Vicious loop go again and again
Fresh out rehab addicted to goin in, word
