I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare

Intangible, bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?

Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional, mystical? Maybe spiritual
Hero who appears in you is a clearer view
When you're too crazy

Lifeless to know the definition for what life is
Priceless for you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smoke get righteous with one toke
You psychic among those possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence, the basics without it you naked
Allow me to make this child, like in nature
Rhythm you have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree

Every child of peace, every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes, I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise from this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm steppin' to your lies through Russ

Though not his muscles but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide, y'all can't see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind, that's the inner

So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless

Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on

It's coming on, it's coming on
My future
