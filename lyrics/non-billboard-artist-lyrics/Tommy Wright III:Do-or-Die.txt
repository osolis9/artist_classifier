Do-or-Die:Tommy Wright III
Either you choose life or you choose death.
Either you choose life or you choose death.
Based on the decision that you make
God has come and offered you life,
Your enemy can only offer you death (deathrow)
If you choose to stay wid your enemy
Then you choose death (deathrow)
If you choose to leave the enemy
and strike out into the unknown...

Die motherfucka cause you knew this was a do or die
Either you gon' die or I'm gon' die,
I-I-It's a homicide

In my situation, of total devastation,
Spread my hustle all across the motherfuckin' nation
Niggas wanna click-a, it don't matter cause you'll get buck
I'm tryna make some bone first, cause I'm tearin' patches out yo heart
When you start to stir like you come from Corna Village,
Blood gon' start to spilly, my gat gon' start to drilly,
Niggas in the head wid that infra-red beamin'
Blood is steady streamin', you fuckin' wid ah demon
Niggas I and murderers in the South is where I dwell
Wid plenty ah clientelle and I got them gats as well
So don't try to run up, cause I'm quick to pull that gun up
I'm askin' questions last, cause I'm sure as hell gon' blast,
A nigga in the past wid that muthafuckin' dumb shit
You don't know who you fuckin' wid, I run, wid a gangsta click
D-I-R-T-Y, R-E-D is not afraid ah you hoes
You gon' die or I'm gon' die, and that's just how the story goes

Yeah Dirty Red up in this bitch
And I want you boys to know on Corna Village
I'm not runnin', and I'm not hidin' from anyone ah you hoes
You know what I'm sayin, a nigga look for me if they want to
or get they ass blast, what's up my nigga Lil Bay

Down for my crown, ten toe down, Tommy ain't givin' a FUCK!
Runnin' and gunnin' a tech in my coat
When I open my trench if a nigga's best built
Niggas who trippin' and scrapin'
a bullet on side ah they face just for fuckin' wid Tommy,
The nigga that's creepin' and sneakin' and peekin'
and bustin' wide seekin' the beautiful money,
Isn't it funny how a nigga get scared,
Watch me put a forty-five to a nigga head
Please don't shoot, first thing that he say
Then he hit his knees and begin to pray
Trick quit cryin' on my motherfuckin' grain
Here leave him at a stand still once he hear it cock,
Look him in the face, put the gun between his eyes
Piss runnin' down his leg, Tommy Wright ain't surprise
Do or die, cause a head know gotta go
In the midst of the pistol smoke,
Mind of a criminal makin' me dog out a dirty hoe
when I be going for broke,
(Die motherfucka, die motherfucka, die)
Since that day I seen Boyz In Tha Hood
I always wanted to do a drive-by,
Buck a nigga down to the ground hangin' out the sunroof
wid the glock cocked ready aim fire,
Grippin' the forty-four, lookin' from side to side
Tryna find business to be in a drive-by
On the mission, as I creep deep wid a click thick as John Gotti
Doggin' the bitches and hoggin' the riches
and fillin' these ditches wid dead bodies...

Straight from a hood called Memphis Tennessee,
Do or die no lie, this shit ain't gon' stop till my casket drop
One man gang Tommy Wright the third known as Tommy three (III)
Down wid ten wanted men till the world end, Street Smart in charge

Thinkin' of a plan, do or die you can try
Project Pimp gon' spill yo blood,
Comin' through the door who is that, finna blast wid the mask,
got ah all tight glove, lunatic lunatic beggin' for mercy
one hit now yo Tommy's they covered wid holes,
Psycho Pimp maniac devious ready to shoot a bitch
leaving yo family froze,
P to the R to the O-J-E-C-T to the P-I-M-P blast
Four to the four what it's cold to ya face
What'cha say, I'm finna kill yo ass
Fillin' you up wid hollow tips
If you pray nigga you'll probably catch a slug
Fuckin' wid one ah these here, nigga die
nigga makin' you lose a pint ah blood,
Jumpin' up outta the Chevy in the bush
I will scatter and leavin' you dead in the street,
Project Pimp buckin' you bitches
so quicka-ly puttin' you sissy ass bitches to sleep,
Lockin' him up in the trunk for those nites
he was screamin' and hollerin' I know he was scared,
Forty-four buck in the trunk outta luck
no more bitch and I know that this nigga was dead,
Runnin' and gunnin' for runnin' and funny
how suckas can call themselves killas and thugs,
Blastin' that hoe he was snitchin'
he got a gun fillin' him up wid them forty-four slugs,
Killin' and pimpin' it's all in my system
so bitches and niggas got trouble for real,
Rest in peace sucka don't fuck wid me
Project Pimp nigga you only got one life to live, BITCH!
