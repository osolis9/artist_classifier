Every-Heart:BoA
Tell me babe, how many do I shed my tears?
Every heart, every heart is not a gentle yet
Shall I do? I can never say my loneliness
Every heart doesn't know so what to say? Oh, what to do?

I was afraid of darkness 'cause I felt that I was left alone
So I prayed for help to the distant million stars

Round and round the planets revolve around the sun
And we always seek after love and peace forever more
Growing, growing woe, baby, we can work it out
Look up at the sky every heart is shining all today

Show me now, what kind of smile do I come across
Every heart, every heart can take a step towards the dreams

All of us want to take a lasting happiness
Whenever you feel sad, I wanna hold you
And give you a sound sleep

Someday every heart's gonna free and easy
We have peace of mind
Someday all the people find the way to love

Goes and goes the time goes on we are not alone
We'll live on together and we will find some precious peace
Sometime we will smile, sometime we will cry somehow
Don't forget believing yourself,  tomorrow's never die

There is the warm heart places on my mind
In my earliest days there and it's so sweet
There are many stars they have talk with me so kind
They say, yes always time's friend of mine, so shine

Round and round the planets revolve around the sun
And we always weak after love and peace forever more
Growing, growing woe baby, we can work it out
Look at the sky every heart is shining all today

Goes and goes the time goes on we are not alone
We live on together and we will find some precious things
Sometime we well smile sometime we will cry somehow
Don't forget believing yourself, tomorrows never die
