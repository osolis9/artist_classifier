Urban-Harvest:Mike Zoot
Alright EZ Elpee session, artist Mike Zoot
Label Guesswhyld
[soft ad lib for 10 seconds]

Yo, up in my mixed drink session, heaven got a ghetto
In orange and tango, eyes red low and mellow
My squint look Tokyo, movin ill slow
My toned rebel, accented like Rachel, voice nasal
Now fix my levels, adjust me two notches, mic's to cable
Produce new paradise through poetics, slum fables
Turnin the bump tables, access a new address
In the rap race runnin the fastest, you'll never catch us
So when I pass the test, pass the rest, I'm passin out pamphlets
With my face on the front, drink or chase with the blunt
Spoken proverb, the new word, observin you herds
You just an ass,??? sparked in the corner, I kick the kerb
The condominium in the next millennium
For my kids' kids' kids and then multiplied to the max, no minimum livin
Caribbean tints, strokin my wall, woman and ism
New comer, young jungalist on the rhythm with a vision
I'm trippin, still for kickin and spittin

[Chorus]
So we can - EAT GOOD
Drinkin - SMOKE GOOD
Burnin - BLACK TREES
Wrapped in - BLACK WOOLS
QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE
Freshed dippin - IN NEW CLOTHES
So now we live - HOW WE SUPPOSE AND IT GOES

Yo pour some liquors on the ground for my niggas not around
And hit the whole cup, straight down, Absolut and Crown
Order another round, I'm clownin wild for the evenin
Good greetins, I bring it with lye and etcete-rah
The down-the-block, better than Best Buy, come check I
For the hook up, ring the bell then look up for the what's up
I puts up, stacks in all columns
Operatin from the bottom, Bed-Stuy Brooklyn wit mad problems
Bringin? out their ears and kick a freestyle for pay
New Gz, different peer, different year for each day
Stayin decent, special gear drycleanin
Floss and mean it, I seened it like a dream in doin cheebas
Only that much, drinkin so on and such
Thinkin with a Dutch, headrush and touch cuts
Bust nuts in different countries and I only been there once
But I'm going back next month and yo you need to come with me
I'm gonna take us

[Chorus]
So we can - EAT GOOD
Drinkin - SMOKE GOOD
Burnin - BLACK TREES
Wrapped in - BLACK WOOLS
QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE
Freshed dippin - IN NEW CLOTHES
Now we live - HOW WE SUPPOSE AND IT GOES, EAT GOOD

Catch me creepin through the fog, deep in through the smog
It's the number one nigga in your hood with no job
Who schooled you, just that, all rappers ackin Hollywood
Spittin flames on the game they call me Zoot Eastwood
North face with the hood, Ma your son done good
But add the injury to the insult, second year same coat
Lighter note different stroke, I been been broke
For the gas we go, never no outlaw so I move this boat
The wholesale rap grail, feel what I see
See my dot dot dash men, the basement bash men
Keepin no attachments, just eat, run and tell
All about the smell of new money back from hell
Here the highway, heaven is, just got paid
On Friday, leanin sideway, my high don't stay
Til I fill up my dinner tray, with meals ridiculous
The ticket, yo yo, this is it for written and kickin shit
Cheese and chicken shit, lickers and bigger spliffs
Excuse me Miss, hit this, I shoot, give generous
Straight faced serious, drivin you delirious
Live in stereo so you can hear it, ya hear it?

[Chorus]
So we could - EAT GOOD
Drinkin - SMOKE GOOD
Burnin - BLACK TREES
Wrapped in - BLACK WOOLS
QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE
Freshed dippin - IN NEW CLOTHES
And how we live? - HOW WE SUPPOSE

And it goes - EAT GOOD
Drinkin - SMOKE GOOD
Burnin - BLACK TREES
Wrapped in - BLACK WOOLS
QUARTO'S (Quarto's), HOLD YA NOSE
Freshed dippin - IN NEW CLOTHES
And how we live? - HOW WE SUPPOSE
