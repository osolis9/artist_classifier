The-Centaur-remix-:Buck 65
Most people are curious
and wanna get dirt on
The Centaur; I'm famous
I walk around with no shirt on
The easiest way would be for you to lie face down
I'm a man
But I'm built like a horse from the waist down
People are afraid of me but act like they love me
Feast your eyes upon my nudity
I am Beauty AND the Beast
I have plenty to say
But nobody listens because my clock is so clean, the hour hand is missing; so I'm famous for it
"Freaky" is what everyone's name is for it
Sure, it's larger than yours
I'm a CENTAUR for Chrissakes!
I like to eat rice cakes and listen to classical music
I'm told passion is my specialty
But really I'm old-fashioned
And I'm quite well-built
As fas as physiques go
So people seem to think that I belong in a freak show
They wanna have pictures taken
Constantly assumin' that my sex drive
is three times that of a normal human
Askin' silly questions like I'm their personal mentor
All they care about is my undercarriage because I'm a centaur
The porno industry
Wants to pay me lots of money to appear in books and movie
'Cause they think I look funny
But I'm lookin' for true love
Not cookies and crumbs
More than a sore thumb - I have a complicated mind
I'm not the favorite kind of companion
For the average person

Sometimes things start well
But eventually worsen when sex becomes a problem
Or else they're unimpressed with the attention that you get
Bein' a centaur's love interest
You don't care about my next life
Just my ex-wife and the intimate details of our sex life
Most people are curious
and wanna get dirt on
The Centaur; I'm famous
I walk around with no shirt on
The easiest way would be for you to lie face down
I'm a man
But I'm built like a horse from the waist down

Most people are curious
and wanna get dirt on
The Centaur; I'm famous
I walk around with no shirt on
The easiest way would be for you to lie face down
I'm a man

call me "country"

so handsome, known to throw a tantrum, quick on the draw than a dog pulling a rikshaw. rock star talkative, talented, provocative
awkward socially, unusually emotional, weighed in proportion my heart is the warmest, unfortunately for me my private part is enormous. also the normal, I am also the authority on all sorts of important stuff morally the centaur
historically horrible, adorable not exactly, magically attractive, drastically endowed, rocket powered jock-unit, nothing new to talk about it, don't even look at me sideways or crookedly, i am crotchedy in more ways than one, macho,
watch out now,
I am furry and furious

Most people are curious
and wanna get dirt on
The Centaur.
