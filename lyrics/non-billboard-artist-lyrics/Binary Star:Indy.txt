Indy:Binary Star
[Intro from the movie "They Live"]
All you boys understood is business, that's all it is
You still don't get it, do you boy? No more good guys!
They're running the whole show, the whole planet
They can do whatever they want!
What's wrong with having a good for a change?
And they're gonna let us have it good if we just help 'em
they're gonna leave us alone! Let us make some money!
You can have a little taste of that good life too..
I know you want it, hell everybody does!
You do it to your own kind...
What's the threat!? We all sell out everyday
Might as well be on the winning team!

[One Man Army]
Yo, this is decomposed, and I gotta say
we need to try to keep this music to ourselves
We sellin' out this art for some money
to some guy who don't care nothin about this music
We gotta keep it to ourselves.. tryin to win the Indy 500
Like this - Check it out (Check it out, check it out)

[Chorus] 2x
All we need is beats, and rhymes and go and spark it
As long as we got the Underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500

[One Man Army]
Start your engines, four propositions got me sittin -
In fifth row you only go if your gassed like Sicko
And since my Terrence car's brand new
My paid Coupe is for me, and the Binary too
For your car, you got the luxuries of a star
You got a crew of two dozen plus an A&R
That's your Axle and your Rx man
Cause after he get rich, man
you skit out on the ditch and be abandoned and need refixin
You also got the pressure from the front to second or lesser
If you don't, you think you'll drive again and you'll never
See, it's not about the car it's the way you drive in it
If you cats can't maintain than you won't survive in it
I'm revivin it, the record wreckage I still do
Comin from behind, unseen by rear view
You sleep in your seat, don't even know what's the deal
No questions to directions, they're controllin your wheel
And if you ever finish first a platinum trophy is risen
Your prize money? Your staff of 2 dozen got destine
Know the cars, know the ranks, because if you forget you're outsmarted
It doesn't matter where you finish, yo, in Double he started

[Chorus]
All we need is beats, and rhymes and go and spark it
As long as we got the Underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500

All we need is beats, and rhymes and go and spark it
As long as we got the Underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win, my goal's to win!

[One Man Army]
It's the battle of David and Goliath - The big and small
We need to get control of this shit, and get it all
Expect these Rec. Execs to make a fall
I came to collect my checks and that's my car - Don't confuse it
They paid your dumbass? Don't abuse it
They get rich, they use it, and they call a nigga music?
You lose it - You're sold for some cuts and promo
But if you really want the dough though, you would go solo
You put food on your table playin the game wrong
While you dialing at Fast Food, they eat Filet Min Yon
They applied the pressure, so you gave them a song
And if that shit don't hit, the next day you're gone
My copyrights are exclusive, for my uses
They make you a public nuisance and to renew it you get two cents?
I got influenced - The underground, the X Factor
Record Deal - Slavery, so when you sign say, "Yes, master"

(Repeat till fade)
[Chorus]x3
All we need is beats, and rhymes and go and spark it
As long as we got the Underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500

[Repeat 2x after Chorus]
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win, my goal's to win! My goal's to win!
