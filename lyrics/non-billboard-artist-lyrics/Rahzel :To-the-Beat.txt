To-the-Beat:Rahzel 
To the beat

Uh, what takin' you back
All the way back
[Incomprehensible] track
On the Rahzel track

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

I let my mind flow like a river
But now Red and Dead sea constantly IMC
No conspiracy like Pope and Constinople
Makin' tracks by themself, you know I bless a little vocal

Artistry since constipated
Nowadays we're with Rahzel, we're glad we waited
Now we got you, right in the spot where we want it
And every single negative vibe is confronted

It's kinda ill when you let your music go free flowin'
Buildin' on improvised grounds and still growin'
People work hard, some wanna escape
But yo, we gotta face the music with ease and with grace

Sometimes we look to jams for an inner inspiration
'Coz the lyrics and the rhythm are the music vibrations
Makin' things gel like a compound equation
Mad sounds culminatin' for one sensation

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

Lights, camera, action, get it on
Watch the beatbox as he lets the sound form
Ain't nobody iller than my man Rahzel
So you other beat machines, don't stress and get gel

A very short suggestion is you go and work harder
Give me a break, my man is fat like Nell Carter
With a brother like the [Incomprehensible] on top with the willy
We the illy, he's phildeplh, we the rusaphilly

It's a thunderous move like a herd of elephants
And it sounds real raw 'coz we in our element
Like natural, never catch these kids on sabbatical
Always upfront, tryin' to give you what you want

You see, it's very crucial that we stand and deliver
Always tryin' to rise above and be a good figure
And we hopin' that you diggin' on the rhymes that we wrote
Better get yourself together, let's flow, come on

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

To the beat and let your mind flow
To the beat, I let my mind go
To the beat, it makes your mind flow
To the beat

To the beat
To the beat
To the beat
