Hey girl, what’s your name?

[Bridge:]
You gotta cut that thing .. girl
Got a king size … creep
If you do shoot to my world
It is what it is.
You could be my superstar
Put your hands up in this beach
We can while out till they kick us out
It is what it is.
I wanna shine you up, make you feel that base
This beat that dirty love, make you vibrate
Make your spot .. is that kill love
I just can’t get enough.

[Chorus:]
Shut up! make it bump
Make it bump, make it bump
Make it, make it bump
Make it bump, make it bump
Shut up!
Make it bump, make it bump
Make it, make it bump

Shut up!

Hey boy ‘cause … one of the world
So you can give ..
Put your hands up, put put your hands up
Make it bump, bump, bump.
Let’s get it crackin’ you know what’s happening
So why you’re .. in my air withal this ..
‘cause I'm not here to talk, I get down and my fingers walk
So shot your lip and take a sit before this little drive.

[Repeat Bridge:]

I wanna shine you up, make you feel that base
This beat that dirty love, make you vibrate
Make your spot .. is that kill love
I just can’t get enough.

Put your hands up bump, bump bump
I wanna turn you up, make you feel that base
This beat that dirty love, make you vibrate
Make your spot .. is that kill love
