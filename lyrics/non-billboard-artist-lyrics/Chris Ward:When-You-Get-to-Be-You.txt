When-You-Get-to-Be-You:Chris Ward
Well you got more money than you got good sense
And a dump truck full of fair weather friends
You say you're gonna change but I don't know how
You done split your personality a hundred ways now

Well I wonder if you'll ever be satisfied
Till you walk on water at high tide
There's only one man ever did that feat
And he's a whole lot better than you and me

Where you gonna go when you go where you wanna go?
What you gonna do when you do what you do?
How you gonna feel when you feel like you wanna feel?
Who you gonna be when you get to be you?

Well you're right at home feelin' out of place
Lookin' in the mirror at a stranger's face
Yeah baby, you're livin' in a world of your own
Smack dab in the middle of the twilight zone

Baby, your life is like science fiction
Honey, ain't you tired of all that friction
They say the truth will set you free
Whatever it is you can tell me

Where you gonna go when you go where you wanna go?
What you gonna do when you do what you do?
How you gonna feel when you feel like you wanna feel?
Who you gonna be when you get to be you?

Take a vacation, try some meditation
Get yourself a new look, maybe even read a book
Once you get your mind right, get a little hindsight
Maybe you can focus in on who you are and where you been

Where you gonna go when you go where you wanna go?
What you gonna do when you do what you do?
How you gonna feel when you feel like you wanna feel?
Who you gonna be when you get to be you?
