Man-Ain-t-Like-a-Dog-skit-:Djay
See...
man ain't like a dog.
And when I say "man," I'm talking about man as in mankind, not man as in men.
Because men, well, we a lot like a dog.
You know, we like to piss on things.
Sniff a bitch when we can.
Even get a little pink hard-on the way they do.
We territorial as shit, you know, we gonna protect our own.
But man, he know about death.
Got him a sense of history.
Got religion.
See...
a dog, man, a dog don't know shit about no birthdays or Christmas or Easter bunny, none of that shit.
And one day God gonna come calling, so you know, they going through life carefree.
But people like you and me, man, we always guessing.
Wondering, "
What if?" You know what I mean?
So when you say to me, "
Hey, I don't think we should be doing this," I gotta say, baby, I don't think we should be doing this neither, but we ain't gonna get no move on in this world, lying around in the sun, licking our ass all day.
I mean, we man.
I mean, you a woman and all, but we man.
So with this said, you tell me what it is you wanna do with your life
