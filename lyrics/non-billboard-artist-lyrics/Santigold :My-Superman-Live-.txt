My-Superman-Live-:Santigold 
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Well, you're a liar and your cues are all wrong
But I can't count all the ways you woo me
I watch you capture what I can't hold
Now make make it make some sense to me

You are, you are my, you are my
You are my Superman

Hey, hey
You got to live, you got to live
You got to live

Make it fly, bless your soul
You get by, take me along
But all the static here, it's tearing you apart
You can't help the way you, you, you, you

You are, you are my, you are my
You are my Superman

Hey you, hey, hey
You, you, you can't wait
Walk, walk, walk on now

Hey

You are, you are my, you are my
You are my Superman

Hey, hey
You got to live, you got to live
You got to live
