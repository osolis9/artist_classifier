No-Curfew:Geto Boys
[Intro: repeat "Geto Boys" and reverse it for 28 seconds]
[beat plays for another 27 seconds]

Ghetto cross the dead line, ring through yo' mind
And in the middle of the jams it's about that time
For you to tell your girl sorry I enjoyed my date
But it's 9:58 and I'm almost late
The car freaked, started freakin, some poor some rich
You checked the time, 9:59, ain't that a bitch
So now you're stranded in your ride, not a {?} to your name
And every time you try to pay him it's the same old game
NO CURFEW~! WE DON'T WANT NO CURFEW~!

Fri-day night, you got your sights, set on this girl
That you met last week at Astro World
She said meet her at 11, and don't be late
The curfew, 12 o'clock, and that's what you hate
My pops is goin out, moms past her sleep
You know my clock struck 1 and my beeper beeped
So I picked up the phone, and got ready to go
Climbed out the window real slow and low soooo
Listen cause I'm only gonna say it - one time
Mom I'm not comin in that's final - next line
Keep the motor runnin, moms on my back
It's like that, to be exact, and that's a fact
NO CURFEW~! WE DON'T WANT NO CURFEW~!
BREAK!

Curfews are what every kid debates
Yo and all we hear is olds mom say
Here lately I've been watching you
You're comin in my house at 1 and 2
Now backing out of the door, I can hear her say
Be back by 12 okay?
NO CURFEW~! WE DON'T WANT NO CURFEW~!
