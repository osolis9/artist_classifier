Look-N-My-Eyez:Speedy Loc
Speedy Loc represent that VGD Town
Decoto, Killafornia
Look in to my eyes motherfuckas
N tell me what you see

Look in to my eyes see the pain through out the years
Young bust getting locked up they mothers shedding tears
And who the fucks to blame up in this dirty filthy game
Aint no food up on the table I feel my moms pain
Its time to pull a jack grab the gat and a ski mask
Gimme all your skrilla before I dump and hit the gas
At night hit liquor stores busting 2-11's
If you reach for that button is a 187
My brain's going insaine cause this ghetto's got me stressed
A bust is a must wearing a bullet proof vest
Pour out a little liquor for the homies that I've lost
Getting hella perved while this hoe sucks my balls
But still I can't concentrate my minds going blank
Late night got me tweking got me hitting the presank
Fool's don't wanna listent reminiscing half visions
Shall I kill or will I kill its all about decisions

Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
A true fucken G backin up VGD
I be shaken em up and fucken em up and layen em all down
A true fucken hog coming up that doge town
Look into my eyes and see the reality of the game
I try to maintain but we about to blow up brains
I'm hitting motherfuckers up with a 9 milla
Taking or breaking the skrillaz cuz I'm a fucken killa

I remember cutting 5th grade back in middle school
Me and Mr. Rella young bucks acting a fool
Didin't give a fuck about much not a damn fucken thang
At 14 years old started hanging gangbang
Throw up that DG represent that 9th street
Finding the homies at the spot or tagging in the creep
Pay back was a motherfucken this [?]
We roll through your hood
Leave your shirt's soaking wet
Lil' Corner got locked up back in 1992
Its been about 8 years he'll be out soon
We used to pose the 6 and known as the main young bucks
Coming up Old G's tought us game
Times get hella hard so they switch up on the grind
I droped out of school got expeled to many times
And ain't no lesson learned cause its all about the game
A young buck growing up with this fucken up ass fast lane

Through out my whole life I ain't never had shit
Thats why I pack a 9 glock with a an extra clip
These foos wanna start funk we could bring it on
We could shake and dump untill the break of dawn
Till [?] And load these clips until they bleed
Fucking with that DG get you smoking lots of weed
Cause in this town [?] dimes gotta hustle to make the skrill
Push up on the grind cause shits getting scandolous in the year 2G's
A little girl named Dee lost her life at 14
If someone could explain why we fucken blow up brains
Then maybe I could maintain but I'm deep up on the game
So I'll continue to live my life quick up in the fast lane
Could take a little trip through the town of the blood stain
And ain't nothing helping us way back in the days
We used to pose and chill with [?]

Look into my eyes and tell me what you see Yeah Yeah this song is going out to every Northern Soljah out there
Let's keep that flame lit
