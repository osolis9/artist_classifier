Surviving-The-Game:Body Count
Yeah, yeah
Murder, death
As I search to analyze reality
The true meaning of life

Out simple existence means nothing
God has a gun, the truth, life is a slow noose
He's invincible
Better watch his knife

There is no escape from the slow kill
When it's time to go
God serves a death blow
You have no choice, don't even try

The only choice is suicide
Surviving the game
No escape
No one's ever escaped
Die
