Verse 1 flava-
i think i need you more then life itself
but i aint about to put down the mic for a girl
i'm feeling your pain, i'm still jus the same

and i can't let go yer
Verse 2 melo-d-
i got somethink to say
the times we chilled together held eachother
slipping away
and now i feel like i can't hold another
missing eachday
now there no one here to run to cover
i'm missing you babe
i feel i'll never find another lover
missing your ways
everyday is the same it rains sitting here
lonely feeling rage and pain
but if you come back soon babe
times don't change
i'll always be here and here i stay

Verse 3 krazy-
there's only one thing i've got to say
that is that i will miss you everyday
we were made for eachother
i know i'll always run
i'm still thinking about ya
i wanna know what i did wrong
all i know is i got to stay strong
i need you i want you
i need you to hold
baby wont you come back home
Chorus-
