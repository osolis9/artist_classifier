Chicanos-Don-t-Dance:Royal T
All up on the floor with my Ben Davis sagging
Tossing up the barrio, you could say I'm bragging
Pendleton and house shoes, you know I'm gang related
Tattooes on my body for the homies that didn't make it
Simon, I pack a fucking chrome
For the juras and the levas that try to step wrong
Slide to the hyna, breath full of alcohol
Spitting game in their ear while they're leaning on the wall
Mira mamacita, I'm glad to meet ya
I love the way you're freaky when you're full of that tequila
Tossing up the barrio on the dance floor
Putting hickies on my neck while I toss up the set
A Brown homegirl who's down
Quick to get them up when it's time to clown
So you better watch your mouth and respect the game
Cuz Chicanos roll deep when we bring the pain
[Chorus]
Chicanos don't dance homey, we boogie
Chicanos don't dance homey, we boogie
Chicanos don't dance homey, we boogie
Chicanos don't dance homey, we boogie

The jura wants to know if I'm gang related
Fuck the PO, I'm still affiliated
So pass the yesca and another glass of drink
Don't play me like a fool unless you want to get shanked
From Texas to LA, we be deep like the marines
Chicanos don't play, we'll leave your house a crime scene
Chale, don't make me get the AK
Dump you on the real and watch you float to TJ
This ain't no fairy tale, that's right ese
It's the Raza till I die, toss the barrio up high
Tear drop up under my eye, don't make me show you why
The vato talks shit, the vato has to die
The big homies don't ask no questions
Just call the shots, do in and start busting
So you better watch your mouth and respect the game
Cuz Chicanos roll deep when we bring the pain
[Chorus]

Ain't no more liquor, you know what that means
Slip on your sweatshirt and your big baggy jeans
Hit the closest liquor store, now back to the barrio
The party ain't over, we can boogie some more
I see one of my homies shooting PCP up
While the other's with some hottie getting hella greased up
Sipping on tequila, throwing G's up
While I'm macking a mamacita trying to get skeezed up
Scemimg on a way to get her in my Chevrolet
So I slipped a Mickey and a big fat J
Told my homies orale, now it's time to play
Hop in your 6-tray, meet me at the Holiday
[Chorus]
