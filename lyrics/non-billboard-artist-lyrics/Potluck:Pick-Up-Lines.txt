Pick-Up-Lines:Potluck
(ft. DJ Chill)

(Girl’s Voice): Oh my god. . . no way

(UnderRated):

What up how ya doing? its very nice to meet ya
I’m a big baller want to get a slice of pizza?
You don’t like pizza thats ok, I was playin, anyway
My name is Josh and I wanted to say hey

So, I know I look like I could be Justin Beiber
but I gotta a case of jungle fever and I just had to meet ya
Baby girl I can make you laugh giggle and joke
And today’s your lucky day I got a pound to smoke
Here just put it in your mouth and have a suck
no not like that girl I’m talkin about the blunt
hun you can relax I’m not like those other guys
I just wanna chill with you and have a good time

I can rehab you sexually if that’s what I gotta do
And you can ask me any question like I’m Doctor Drew
I got her laughing I think she really likes me
Never thought I was a pimp but Hmmm I might be

Chorus: (DJ Chill):

Excuse me what’s your name girl?
I seen you over there chillin’ doin’ ya thang girl
You’ve heard it all before but now it ain’t a game girl
You without me? Aww, what a shame girl
Excuse me what’s your name girl?
I seen you over there chillin’ doin’ ya thang girl
You’ve heard it all before but now it ain’t a game girl
This is how I came cause I’m nothin like these lames

(1 Ton):

Let me take ya back a couple days ago
I was looking for a blunt instead a sound checkin for the show,
When I came across this girle early at the club
lookin hella curvy and I heard she got the chronic bud

So I had to slide on over and ask “how she be”
Introduced myself “I’m 1 Ton the MC”
I’m looking for a sexy girl to share some weed with me,
And If I had a dream you would be my fantasy

She laughed at every pick up line that I had,
Yo baby, roll with me you’ll neva cry or be sad
An I am so rad to all the girls in the suburbs,
An I am so bad to all the girls that wanna be hood

She busted out her weed and started rollin some up
She said one night with her and that I’m probably gonna go nutz,
Rep for Humboldt County, Ya town got nothin on us
A sucker for a stoner bitch who eats at Dunkin Donuts

Baby like a big guy, Who’s hung like dam
Baby’s down to have as much fun as we can
She comfortable around me, I’m one nice man
So we ended at my telly for a one night stand

Chorus: (DJ Chill):

Excuse me what’s your name girl?
I seen you over there chillin’ doin’ ya thang girl
You’ve heard it all before but now it ain’t a game girl
You without me? Aww,  what a shame girl
Excuse me what’s your name girl?
I seen you over there chillin’ doin’ ya thang girl
You’ve heard it all before but now it ain’t a game girl
This is how I came cause I’m nothin like these lames

(DJ Chill):

She was walkin down the street so I said Helloooo
My name is, Chillest Illest from the city P.O.
She said “So” I said “So?” well nevermind my city
But i think your really pretty I’m feelin you should get with me
 I Know you hear that often with that skin so smooth & soft
I gotta blunt that we can smoke I’ll bet your sexy when you cough
YaduduBkazaBlah. . . a bluesy and some convoe,
Now I’m feelin cozy with my feet all in her condo

She pulled out more green than Rondo
Looking in my eyes like she’s ready to play my  bongos
What am supposed to do she aint wearin no thong yo
With her lips around it but it ain’t a bong bro
I’m a smooth brotha, Versace smothered,
High is what she got because I’m not these others
She wanted to watch me love her
That’s cool cause the Magnum box got three rubbers

Chorus: (DJ Chill):

Excuse me what’s your name girl?
I seen you over there chillin’ doin’ ya thang girl
You’ve heard it all before but now it ain’t a game girl
You without me? Aww,  what a shame girl
Excuse me what’s your name girl?
I seen you over there chillin’ doin’ ya thang girl
You’ve heard it all before but now it ain’t a game girl
This is how I came cause I’m nothin like these lames
