Staying-Tru:Blue Ragg
Now I got love for my niggas on the set
Every day from sunset to sunrise them pack a Mill-Tec
Niggas that run up - just jeopardize their lives
Recognize I stayin tru till I die

Gots love for the Crip niggas
Slugs for the bitch niggas
Cause I'm gon' trip nigga
And muthafuck your click nigga
And Cuz down on Ferguson
Cuz came up missing
And this hole I'm still diggin
No remorse, oh of course
I'm not gonn' give a
Fuck about that poor nigga will I never up in this liver
What the D like (nigga!)
What the S like (killa!)
What the C like
Post it up with this Tec-9
Split that head of a hater nigga that's right
And got a wake up from them po-po's nigga last night
See I caught them slippin'
And I'm gonna crippin'
Knick knack patty wack shoot the dog a bone
No, Cuz shoot his ass and the dome
Did I push back to the set po-po chasin' me
Blue Ragg, 1-0-4, crippin'... (stayin' true till I die)

I got love for my niggas on the set
Every day from sunset to sunrise them pack a Mill-Tec (Stayin tru till I die)
Niggas that run up - just jeopardize their lives
Recognize I'm tru till I die

You'se a tough man wanna see dead man gonna be
Back up nigga and now your ass wants to flee
You'se a man, but the bitch at will
That type of motherfucker we gon' kill for real
Oh shit can't you tell a nigga fire up
And see in my face when I drive up
One stick just to wind me up
Oh shit somebody tie me up
I'm a little ho nigga
Just the bag of bones
One tuff nigga shot bag and gone
With a
Hard head as I maintain
Mama can't change what I never changed
Bitch crack a bad joke, bitch gotta back broke
Now what about my dead homie back though
And just cause I'm fucked, the D-S-C
Nigga that hoe should've known not to fuck with me
So I'm
Hop high of the rooftop - pain
Next thing nigga who shot
Nigga that's a done deal and fuck your ass
And since it's on like that then I disrespect your ass
See it ain't like a nigga gon' sit, play dead or roll over
See nigga I'm a soldier
Representin' 1-0 hit 'em up the 4
Motherfucker yeah you know I stay true till I die

I got love for my niggas on the set
Every day from sunset to sunrise them pack a Mill-Tec (Stayin tru till I die)
Niggas that run up - just jeopardize their lives
Recognize I'm tru till I die
Still high off the triple dick stickin from? to high
Death quick if you trip? why (Stayin tru till I die)
If the mad make my blue flag and slugs fly
Cuz I stay true till I die
