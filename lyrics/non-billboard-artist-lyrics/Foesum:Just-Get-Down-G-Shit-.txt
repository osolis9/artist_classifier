Just-Get-Down-G-Shit-:Foesum
Bitch where you at
Baby baby just get on down
just get on down just get on down
just get on down just get on down
[T Dubb]
Come take a trip with me to the Eastside
with the homeys from the Foe love to whoo ride
dippin clownin trippin and sparkin
sittin in the back with a cup of Remy Martin
bouncin in a 64 straight flexin
gold wide rims candy paint will reflect shit
time to hit the cut so now you know
I'm packin much heat from the west to the east coast
so now I'm ready to ride, lets roll
floatin, coastin, 3 wheel motion
hittin every corner nigga when I dip
I gotta hit a switch so I can make the ass lift
16 switches front and back
crawlin sideways with my Chronic sack
rollin through the LBC wit a grip
so listen to the Dubb as I flow with some G Shit
(Chorus) x2
Just get on down (just get on down)
Just get on down (just get on down)
Just get on down (just get on down)
How do you shake baby
[DJ Glaze]
Comin through the cut muthafuckaz get these
drop top Benz with the AMGs
hookin shit up, movin over the competition
listen, fools dont know I'm on a mission, dippin
3 qualos deep with the beat
as I floss up and down the street, so peep
I got the chip in the Motorola flip
G lock 19 if these fools wanna trip
(do you see em) see em
(spot em) T-Dubb should I get em
(get em) got em
hang his ass up, break him down to a minimum
givin him no chance, I got the 9 to make his ass dance
we bring him problems in 95
so break wide while my click's hittin side to side
its unbelieveable the way we dip
so just ride, as we demonstrate some G Shit
(Chorus) x2
Just get on down (just get on down)
Just get on down (just get on down)
Just get on down (just get on down)
How do you shake baby
[M&M;]
Now I crawls in, slidin in a drop blue Regal
sittin on these 13 inch wheels
dippin cuz my homeboys got the hook up
hit the back streets, the police get shook up
stopped at the light, rolled a J of the indo
got the shit lit, rolled up the tinted window
smoke's in the air so I'm buzzin
and I got a grip in my pocket cuz I came up hustlin
rolled to the homey's pad, shits on dank
grabbed the 40 ounce, took it straight to the neck
gettin fucked up fool, like an OG
standin 6 feet with the bald head and gold teeth
mob to the ride so me and the homey shake
got the nickel plated 45 tucked by my waist
so if anything pops act like you didn't see shit
or get that ass twisted cuz I'm kickin that G Shit
(Chorus) x2
Just get on down (just get on down)
Just get on down (just get on down)
Just get on down (just get on down)
How do you shake baby
