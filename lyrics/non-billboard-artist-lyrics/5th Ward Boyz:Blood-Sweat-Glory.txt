Blood-Sweat-Glory:5th Ward Boyz
(Verse 1)
A backstreet killer a 5th ward assassin
So raise the fuck up muthafucka when I'm blastin
My buckshot: buck*buck*buck buck 'em down till they blood shed
And it ain't stoppin till the muthafuckas lay dead
Too many punk-ass niggas try to house on me
And put the chrome to my dome and try to gaffle me
It's Ninety-3 and I ain't goin out like that
I flex vest and pull a strap with a phat Gat
Cause in the game good game pigs sew game
No money no power no glory MUTHAFUCK pain!
It's blood sweat and murder just to come on top
If you don't get then you stuck so you're gettin got
It takes a stroll with the devil down the Glock road
You're gettin fucked when that Gauge droppin heavy load
I blast wicked so I'm goin out like a champ
FUCK the county FUCK the pen and FUCK a boot-camp
I'm down to die and down to kill for my own shit
And break-a-hat to a busta-ass punk bitch
I stand stroll cause the Circle is my back bowl
And peel your cap bitch has stranded in the killin zone
So what the fuck you gonna do cause I ain't worryin
Yeah, I work hard for my bitch
Blood, Sweat & Glory

(Verse 2)
Comin up in 19-93
You bunch of muthafuckas die
And yo, I asked why be-a-bein blazed to that hella fry
Flicks like a muthafucka rippin and wreckin up shit
Ghetto ways nigga from the 5th comin up quick
Runnin from that heroine
Money from that black [?]
[not sure what's said] fiends bumpin hella dope
Now it's straight mobbin
Doin whatever the fuck it takes
Hittin 'em with the Mack-A-Blast
Boomin like some faults
Gangs corrupt cause it's fucked up
The shit is sold *pronto*
Stupid punk is steppin with that muthafuckin sawed-off
Peace to them niggas on the corner drinkin the 40 oz.'s
And peace to them real muthafuckin O.G.'s
And to you ho's I never showin that sorrow
*Ad√≠os* y'all niggas cause you'll never see tomorrow
This game is too unbend for them punk muthafuckas
Buckin up shit makin real niggas suffer
I'm true to my shit G and can't shit change me

So save all that Ho shit cause Ho shit bores me
Peace to them down-ass niggas fool
Blood, Sweat & Glory
