You-Got-Me:One Block Radius
You got me
No need to wonder why
Don't have to question
So clear your worried mind!

Now I don't wanna lose you
But I'm tryin' do what I gotta do, too
I know the style of my life might confuse you
And I don't blame you one bit
I don't even say nothin' when you trip

But I thought I told you
You can put it on my shoulders, I can hold you
And I don't care who all believes me, I'ma show you
Momma it's been a long time
My leadin', bangin? boys about to shine

All up on my grind
Gotta get this money what door, just a little crack
I'm gonna kick it in and make some noise, baby I'll be back
Gotta keep you movin' ma
That's how we do it ma
We chasin' dreams and makin? wishes
I'm your shootin' star

Now I don't really want to leave you right now
And I don't even really wanna go
And I don't even wanna see you cry now
Baby you should already know
