We gotta make a change
It’s time for us as a people to start making some changes
Let’s change the way we eat
Let’s change the way we live
And let’s change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn’t working
So it’s on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 1]
Feel that? There’s urgency in the air
Mercy flairs falling in front of foreign affairs
Feel it? I know that’s your fear
You’re scared to hear it
But if I am not there
Then I am near in spirit
24 hours to live if you don’t change it
You could go on embrace it
Or waste it if you don’t face it
You could prolong your fate for a moment by staying home
But in a moment you could be moaning and groaning from complications
Who knows? Better pick up your phone
Say hello to your homies, and say goodbye to your folks
Cancel plans for the future and say you probably won’t go
Say I am sorry to Jesus and hopes he your soul
Hope he sends a gust of wind that sweeps right off your toes
Ask the Father for forgiveness of your sins
Take ‘em farther in the distance, oh
And if you ever wanna try to find a new way
Remember if you’re early, you’re probably too late
You better run

[Hook:]
Whatever it is, it’s coming to get you
Whatever it is, it’s coming your way
Whatever it is, it’s coming to get you
Whatever it is, it’s coming your way

[Verse 2:]
I told you not to be brave, but you won’t listen
You tryin' to figure a way to get credit, bitch you don’t get it
You tryin' to be Martin Luther revisited
You should run from your tunnel vision
And come to your senses
This is none of your business
People floating on doors torn off their hinges
Getting torched, getting tossed from Brooklyn bridges
Pause
Get your logic restored
That’s your only resort
There’ll be no remorse for all the killings
Of course, better get off your porch
Come to grips with your anger
And try to summon your force
Creep a murk with a pistol
And go to work with your sword
Go and get you a chamber and try preservin' your corpse
Dress as if it was the winter when you’re going up north
If you feel like you were sinnin', then repent, say a prayer before you enter
Oh and if you ever wanna try find a new way
Remember, if you’re early, you’re probably too late
You better run

[Bridge: x6]
Better run!!
As fast as you c-c-c-c-can
Better run!!

I am a reflection of the community
I am not saying I am going to rule the world or that I am going to change the world
But I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world

[Verse 3:]
My darling, I pray that I'm alive to see the morning
There's no need to talk, do whats important
Just give me your heart, spare me your comments
I kept you in the dark to protect you from the dark, I protected you from walking into carnage
I presented you with options, I brought you to the arts
While I covered up my scars as an artist
There's nothing like a heartbreak from someone being honest
All you feeling is heartache, I'm going through it the hardest
I'm steady trying to soar, you're biting down my harnest
I'm supposed to fight with the gods, im fighting with my goddess
The golden days are gone now. You're telling me let my guard down
I'm trying not to let my God down. I could't be left unguarded
God-willing I got it
Instead of you telling me calm down
I'm watching it all get torn down
I got to do something about it
