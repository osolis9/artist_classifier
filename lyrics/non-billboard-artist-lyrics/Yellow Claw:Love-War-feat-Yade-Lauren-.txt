[Verse 1]
Cut me through my skin
Through the heart, yeah, you went right in
I fell for every word you said
I can't leave but I can't stay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why some things have to be this way

[Chorus]
We build it up, build it up to break it down
And then we're lost until we're found
And when we're high further from the ground
If all is fair in love and war
I can't do this anymore
If all is fair in love and war
I can't do this anymore

[Post-Chorus]
So unfair, so unfair, so unfair to me
So unfair, so unfair, so unfair to me

[Verse 2]
You told me from the start
Nothing could tear us apart
Now when I look I see a stranger
I can't leave but I can't stay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why some things have to end this way

[Chorus]
We build it up, build it up to break it down
And then we're lost until we're found
And when we're high further from the ground
If all is fair in love and war
I can't do this anymore
If all is fair in love and war
I can't do this anymore

[Post-Chorus]
So unfair, so unfair, so unfair to me
So unfair, so unfair, so unfair to me
