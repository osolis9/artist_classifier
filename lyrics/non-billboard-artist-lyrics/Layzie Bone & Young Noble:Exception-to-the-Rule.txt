Exception-to-the-Rule:Layzie Bone & Young Noble
They say if it goes up, then it must come down
But I’ve been flying so high and I’ll never hit the ground
So I hear what they say and it might be true
But not for me, I’m the exception to the rule
The exception to the rule

What you know about me? Nada
It don’t matter nigger, I can take a …nigger
When I turn into a dollar, might loose a couple stacks but I get it right back
Never crumble never crack washing that sweat of my collar,
Holler, holler, real thug power, some would say that I will my way
Never deviated from my … on the come up
Y’all should know I just feel this way,
…every day… must pay
Like the fighter on the grind you with me or shake
… it’s always a new day
Welcome to the world that they all wanna be in
Welcome to the world that they all wanna be in
My swagger the new faith, this what they believe in
Young thug coming straight about the Cleveland
One time for the definition meaning
Sunshine yeah never stop my dreaming
2 times for them pretty girls screaming
I’m a human being winning
Born to make it look naturally
I take flight in this magically
Define the law they call gravity

They say if it goes up, then it must come down
But I’ve been flying so high and I’ll never hit the ground
So I hear what they say and it might be true
But not for me, I’m the exception to the rule
The exception to the rule

I mean everybody accept me, a little lucky especially
I can’t help it cause they accept me
Probably known I’ve been set free
I’m working on my new mely
Composition still deadly
Haters wanna come test me
Reason why I’ma stay ready when a nigger wanna check me out
I’m always grinding, militant man and built to last
Criminal mind that’s from my past
Gave them all time to catch up but I’m still too fast
Still do cash, still do grab, snatching, what?
Double it up match it
This is what you call the law of attraction
Lucky Layzie Bone is a real money magnet
Y’all my … me I gotta have it
Doing without it, it just seems so tragic
Might as well be laid in the casket
Being broke is so damn plastic
Hey, I cruise automatic, my shoes never do get static
I get the money but don’t flash it
Come take the flight with your captain

They say if it goes up, then it must come down
But I’ve been flying so high and I’ll never hit the ground
So I hear what they say and it might be true
But not for me, I’m the exception to the rule
The exception to the rule

This is what you call the law of lift, the law of lift
And I’m never coming down
This is what you call the law of lift, the law of lift
And I’m never coming down
If you don’t hide your indoor cannabis kush…
I make mistakes, still my friends there’s no regrets
I push, I smash, I gets what’s mine
I live my life up in the sky
I’m cool, I’m fresh, I’m fly
I know that’s why they call me super fly

They say if it goes up, then it must come down
But I’ve been flying so high and I’ll never hit the ground
So I hear what they say and it might be true
But not for me, I’m the exception to the rule
The exception to the rule.
