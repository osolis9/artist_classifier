Morning-After:dvsn
Start of the morning
Everyone's calling you to get some time
It can wait till the morning
The world is safer when we're both inside

Tell me what it's gonna take for you to stay
You ain't gotta do a thing
No you can just lay here with me tonight
You can just lay here, roll up and stay here

I know you think it must be the alcohol
And yeah I've been drinking, no it ain't that at all
Is it you? Is it me? Is it both of us?
And now that we're comfortable
