Shackled:Ghetto Commission
Commission #1} 
 Who's the man and what's his plan is it to kill off all his niggas? 
 It's the 90's motherfucka we no longer stays the cotton pickas 
 We be gangsta's fuckin soldiers riders ride and you feel me 
 If mista master touch this nigga then that bitch gon have to kill me 
 See yall lil niggas or trill niggas your defense is try to jill niggas 
 See I was called a real nigga but also known as phil nigga 
 A house nigga a bitch nigga kissin up to the man 
 Yes sir master no sir master but ain't part of the master's plan 
 They used to beat us and mistreat us tying ropes around necks 
 Now them bitches want to be us and hang around our sets 
 They used to rape our fuckin weaks destroy our dreams and steal our hopes 
 So I'll be that snipa sniping at they heads through rifle scopes 

 {Chorus} 
 it's so hard with these shackles on my feet 
 it's so hard i rather die if i'm not sleep 

 {Commission #2} 
 That ole slave shit 
 Was gay shit 
 Cause niggas didn't want to say shit 
 But If I was 40's bound 
 I would of turned that shit around 
 Look here master pick that cotton 
 And you bets not miss a spottin 
 And if you thank about escaping I'm gon shoot you while you trottin 
 I'm feelin horny fuckin right BOY I'm gon fuck your wife tonight 
 I'm gon do it out of spite cause I'm a nigga and she's white 
 I waxed that ass yesterday and if it seems 
 you still revealed so when I ring this fuckin bell 
 Hangings taking place at twelve 
 They'll be phil honkeys and house honkeys kid honkeys doin laundry 
 And those I didn't included will be entertaining us like monkeys 
 As for riding shotgun fuck that I'll be in the back countin my riches 
 That way I can keep my fuckin eyes on all you bitchez 

 {Chorus} 
 it's so hard with these shackles on our feet 
 it's so hard all the things you done to me 
 it's SO HARD! why has the Lord forsaken me? 
 it's so hard i rather die if i'm not sleep 

 {Commission #3} 
 Now lets talk about the people 
 with the white sheets and burning crosses 
 Roamin through the night wit they torches 
 Sayin a white girl has been tampered wit by a black man 
 Swingin ropes around the oaks sayin they found they man 
 it's that type of story down south how they jus fuck over a nigga 
 Have us hangin from tree limbs God the shit gets grim 
 it's us against them 
 But the bitchez got the upper hand 
 Cause we robbin from our own land 
 It was to many to take a stand 
 So we ran 
 Through the underground railroad like Harriet duckin off 
 Walkin through water and shit to hide ourselves from the dark 

 {Commission #4} 
 Now the hands of time then turned since slave shit and whips 
 But are we still shackled down by the fucked up politics 
 They say it's equal oppurtunites 
 But look at the difference in our community 
 We livin in hell they living in luxury 
 Them bitches scared of the black power 
 Put the dope in our hood to divide and devour 
 But Lord we still fightin but they got us on the ropes 
 We came so far but we still got so far to go 

 {Chorus} 
 it's so hard with these shackles on our feet 
 it's so hard all the things you done to me 
 it's SO HARD! why has the Lord forsaken me? 
 it's so hard i rather die if i'm not sleep
