High-On-Life:Flipsyde
'm high (so high), On life on life
I'm high (so high), On life on life

Everytime I'm feelin' so blue I get you in it,
Then my skys change from grey to blue, uh huh, you did it.
So I'll keep you by me and I'll let you stay
Long as you keep makin' me feel like a summer day

Then I let you (Get down on it)
Then I get you (Hot like on it)
So don't crowd me just let me do what I do

Let me do my thing, can you let me do my thing
Cause it's my time, my life,
And right about now I'm feelin' like,

I'm high (so high) on life on life
I'm high (so high) on life on life

And sometimes I don't have a clue just how you did it,
Got me strung up on you and (ooh) baby there's no limit,
[? ] more of everyday
Cause you get me seein' this life in a different way.
Right about now, I'm feelin' like a dream
Cause you got me doin' these crazy things and,
I don't care what other people think cause it's my own life

Let me do my thing, can you let me do my thing
Cause it's my time, my life,
And right about now I'm feelin' like,

I'm high (so high) on life on life
I'm high (so high) on life on life

(Merci
