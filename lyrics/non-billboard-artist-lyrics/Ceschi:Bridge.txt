Bridge:Ceschi
feat. Tommy V

Julius
Don't set foot on that bridge
Everyone who did has lost a life or limb

Temptation aches in your loins
And grows on your face
After the constant disappointment builds an edifice around
Boundaries you've developed
Over bottomless time
They are carefully hidden behind
This invincible popular image
That simply defies what you really are
You're no superstar
Julius and the bearded savior
Is a lie

Julius
Don't set foot on that bridge
There are trolls under it
Waiting for revenge

Julius
Don't set foot on that bridge
Those wooden planks
Won't hold a head growing so big

Julius
Don't set foot on that bridge
There are plenty of other options
Back roads and alternate highways

Julius
Don't set foot on that bridge
Everyone who did has lost a life or limb
