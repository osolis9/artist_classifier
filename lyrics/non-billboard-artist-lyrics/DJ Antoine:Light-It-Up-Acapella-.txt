Light-It-Up-Acapella-:DJ Antoine
There's something in the air that's making me so loco
feel it from my cabe√ßa down to my toes
I feel the better motion that's stronger than the ocean
Before I even know it, I'm letting go

Forget all your problems, you don't have to solve them
You just got to live and love
So lets come together, a moment forever
We'll shine like the stars above

Light it up
In the heat of the night
There's a fire in your eyes
I can see it
Light it up
Watch the temperature rise
Raise your hands to the sky
If you feel it

Feel like its getting hotter, sweat dripping like a sauna
You should close up if you wanna, yeah its alright
Cause it's a celebration but every infestation
We got no renovation, nobody mind

Forget all your problems, you don't have to solve them
You just got to live and love
So lets come together, a moment forever
We'll shine like the stars above

Light it up
In the heat of the night
There's a fire in your eyes
I can see it
Light it up
Watch the temperature rise
Raise your hands to the sky
If you feel it

Light it up
In the heat of the night
There's a fire in your eyes
I can see it
Light it up
Watch the temperature rise
Raise your hands to the sky
If you feel it
