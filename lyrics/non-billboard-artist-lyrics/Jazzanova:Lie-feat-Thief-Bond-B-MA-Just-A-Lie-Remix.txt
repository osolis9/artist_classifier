Lie-feat-Thief-Bond-B-MA-Just-A-Lie-Remix:Jazzanova
I don't have to believe what you believe in
You don't really have to waste
Precious time,

I don't have to accept what you're imposing
A sense of humility,
But did you find

I don't have to embrace what you're announcing
I don't want to tell you twice,
You know

I don't wanna know,
I don't wanna follow don't wanna know

I have to admit that seems really fascinating
You seem to walk around without
Any doubt,

But to me it seems slightly irritating
As you really seem to be
True about,

All the things but I know I've got my own way
Some direction made from me,
To them

You don't have to know,
You don't have to follow don't have to know

So everything you say is true
Maybe you should shut up and start to
Cry...

So everything you say is true
But don't wait begin to me just a
Lie...

Just a lie...

Lie...

Surprise, surprise, don't forget this
Got the brain working in
Its own way,

This is my life I have to live it
And you may ask if I either don't
Have to say,

What to think to justify my position
And if you want to keep yours
Because,

I don't have to know,
I don't have to follow don't have to know

I don't have to believe what you believe in
You don't really have to waste
Precious time,

I don't have to accept what you're imposing
A sense of humility,
But did you find

I don't have to embrace what you're announcing
I don't want to tell you twice,
You know

I don't wanna know,
I don't wanna follow don't wanna know

So everything you say is true
Maybe you should shut up and start to
Cry...

So everything you say is true
But don't wait begin to me just a
Lie...

Just a lie...
Just a lie...
Just a lie...
You just lie...
Oh, you lie...
You lie...
You lie...
You lie...
You lie...
You lie...
