It-s-All-Real:Pitch Black
When tomorrow comes, I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of the things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes, when tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes, when tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
Darkness all around
I hope that I could fly
Then I sing along, then I sing along

Then I sing along, then I sing along

I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
You kickstart my heart when you're shinin' in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night
You're gettin' me through the night
Cause you're my flashlight, cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight, cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night

I got all I need when I got you and I
Cause I look around me and see a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight

You're gettin' me through the night (We belong)
You kickstart my heart when you're shinin' in my eyes
I can't lie, it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're getting me through the night (We belong)
Cause you're my flashlight, cause you are
Cause you're my flashlight, cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
You're gettin' me through the night
Oh, cause you're my flashlight, cause you're my
Gettin' me through the night
