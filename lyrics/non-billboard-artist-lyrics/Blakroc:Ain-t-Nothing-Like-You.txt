Ain-t-Nothing-Like-You:Blakroc
Pure heart, I love you

Pure heart, you're super cool
You're live and elemental, you're sweet and you're true
You're so true, you're plain and yet so special
It's nothin' like you, you're so cool

You're sweet and rude
You're so plain that it's special it's nothin' like you
You make me stand up and holla
"Do the hoochie coo", you're so cool

They told me pain only shows you where you goin'
You get to laugh then that shows you where you been
And when you get the cash that only shows you how to sin
Like when you gettin' fast money and you blow it in the wind

Where we from success, one in a million
We thought success was gettin' money in front the buildin'
End of the summer we was countin' up the killin's
Like they killed baby boy tryna run up in the buildin' now

Love, I bruised one of her rose petals
She was from the concrete and came up out the cold ghetto
But so gentle but it appears, like, on a clear light
It could thunderstorm, want some more

Pure heart, I love ya pure heart
Pure heart, it's nothin' like you

You're so
You're live and elemental, you're sweet and you're rude
So cool and fiery too
You're plain and elemental, you're sweet and you're rude
You're so true

Most say I'm politically incorrect
But most people scared, they spit it so indirect
I've been accused of same thing as you
But I refused ta, follow rules of who

The complexion of politics done changed
And the computer glitch put so many problems
Up in the game that, uh
I prolly still be sellin' 'caine if I didn't get a chance
At the stardom or the fame

Bein' humble is a hard quality to achieve
When your ego is crazy with no modesty
We make good music just usin' the black keys
And I'm flyin' through the hood in my newest of black Vs, peace

You're plain and elemental ain't nothin' like you
You're pure heart
