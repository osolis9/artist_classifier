Smoke-Marijuana:Sizzla
Yea (herbalist) smoke all day
Let music keep on play

Sometimes the things you need in life may be difficult
Not all the time its gonna be easy
A so it go
Smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
Im feeling so very good about myself
Babylon aint feeling good d*** thats there problem
I smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
Ah when Ive got problem at home domestically
And my girl she just wanna quarrel me
I smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
Love is the order of the day you better find it
Im a big man I put my problems behind me
I smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly

Cause Im so confident in myself
Theres nothing nor no one that could get to me
Not even the d*** system so listen properly
Right now Im merry and cherry and living happily
If those Babylonians mess with us today the music a play
I smoke my problems away
Me an couple of my friends were just chilling on the corner
Listening to the music from Jamaica to Bahamas
Yea we decided to go link the farmer
Need something for the brain its the marijuana
Happy as a lord when the good vibes stir up
When the chanting start you get burn you few corrupt
We smoke all day an still we got the herbs or a???
Dont you Babylon erupt
We give thanks for this day we keep the meditation
Music and more music we burn the pagan
No if no buts no arguments
Marijuana is my only sacrament

I smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
Smoke the marijuana and get high
Give thanks and praise ises high

All when Babylonians going down
Rasta man still request a hundred pound
Blaze up the chalice and we pass it around
And if Im a by myself I go smoke it alone
We got the skunk to make u drunk it make u rock it makes u bounce
We got the diesel the easel we go enough for the people
We got the hydro to rise you
Smoke and get wiser
Chalice hafe blaze we smoking purple haze
Smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly

Sometimes the things you need in life may be difficult
Not all the time its gonna be easy
A so it go
Smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
Im feeling so very good about myself
Pagans aint feeling good thats there problem
I smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
Ah when Ive got problem at home domestically
And my lady just wanna quarrel wit me
I smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
Love is the order of the day you got to find it
Im a big man an I put my problems behind me
I smoke the marijuana and get high
Stay above the wicked and fly
