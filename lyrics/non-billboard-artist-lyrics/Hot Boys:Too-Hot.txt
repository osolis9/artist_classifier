Too-Hot:Hot Boys
I took off, fuck the law, lookin' for B.G.
Sayin' that I killed a nigga around the club last week
Left the scene ridin' in a big body
So I flip and scrip now I'm in da EF three

Playin' by different bitches 'cuz my face in the paper
Profile done although she couldn't describe me, I got the eraser
I don't discriminate I flip a bitch too
She got to be eliminated I kill a bitch too

She, her hair fixed by my sister, she lost, she gonna get her
To let me drop her off by this nigga, across the river
She ridin' with me thinkin' that it's cool and shit
She don't think I know that she let her live loose and shit

I'm gonna pull over, pull her out and pop, some slugs in the bitch
And leave her pussy stinkin' 'cuz I don't love a bitch
But I was smart comin' up, never trust a bitch
And don't hesitate for a minute to chug the bitch

She was tryin' to get me locked up
It was a must that the hoe get cocked up
Fuckin' with me best believe that I'll do ya lots
Got ya sayin' them Hot Boy niggas too, too hot, too, too, hot

What do ya call a nigga that be duckin' the law

Lil' one kind of remind me of me
