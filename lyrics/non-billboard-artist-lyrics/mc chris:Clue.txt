It is a pseudonym and I am game
There is a murderer who means to maim
But I don't like to lose I'll find the clues and then deduce

1950's mighty nifty
Joe McCarthy farts on history
Boys made him hardy it's hardly a mystery
Was he a nancy who fancied fisting
There is a butler he is under
Lots of stress I bet he'll blunder
He's worth wads what are the odds there's thunder
He'll find bods what's the plot I wonder
Here comes the colonel don't mean chicken
He's been known to stick his dick in
Cleavage convulses pulses quicken
Plot will thicken when he goes missin'
Listen closely here's a hostess
Named peacock got halitosis
She is the grossest spose she knows this
A senator's wife extremely explosive

White is a widow lost her husband
She is little, cruel and crushin'
Take your tool while you're fooled by blushin'
Mind your head stead of findin' russians
Plums a professor, ladies confess their
Sins while he grins and begins to undress her
If you're a guest best not to sequester
Spite her protests his quest's to molest her

Sense of humor defense mechanism
She takes pictures system gisms
District sadistic little bit of lipstick
Green is a queen with a clean demeanor
Hates allegations but he's gay for wiener
Can't forget Yvette if you ever get to meet her
She's a got a set make you pet your peter

Then we had dinner monkey and shark
Tried to shed light it's about get dark
Clock couldn't stop but no one else could start
Last guest was a gent put fear in your heart
Man named Boddy holds us captive
Lascivious secrets we wish were retracted
We have positions we must keep protected
Plead for forgiveness you'll just get rejected
Blackmail's a sad tale being extorted
Dead on the floor looking poor and contorted
We all had a weapon and motive that's morbid
Best get to steppin' our reps can't afford it
Run to the kitchen cook is screaming
Knife in back what the fuck I'm dreaming
The maid's acting grave in the room for gaming
Am I getting framed or saved from shaming?

Scarlett's screamin' makes it seem like murder
The chandelier crashes like a fascist fuhrer
Cop comes calling we're stallin' for certain
Pretend we're friends plum succumbs to perversion
Secret passage doors get unlocked
Dumb dirty cop bout to get his top knocked
Maid gets strangled telegram gunshot
