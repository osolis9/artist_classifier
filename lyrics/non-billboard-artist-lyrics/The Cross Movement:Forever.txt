Forever:The Cross Movement
Yeah, forever and forever

Break yourself and don't try ta
Front on your man T O N I the C
When you bring it don't even try to lie to me
If it's real then you know how it's gotta be

By now you know my motta
Ain't nobody here tryin' to flex brovado
You know the signachatto, it's Christ we follow
If He's Lamont then I wanna be Rallo

I know, it's hard in the land of the lollipops
When they're up in your face every time the trolly stops
But God gots folly cops so before folly starts, folly stops
For the last and evil

It's gonna take more then stain glass and steeple
But a distinctive people, who only bow down to the Regal
The One who didn't count it robbery to be called equal

They the ones wit no fear, they the ones who stay clear
Of the wolf and the wolf in sheep's gear, Word bond
They know the different between Luke 9:50
And the whole book of first John

Watch the con, he's an artist
Makin' you feel rabbit when you know that the tortoise, taught us
Who's gonna win, only because a loving God gotta deal wit' sin
Because He loves man

More then your striff, more then you pain
'Cause to live is Christ and to die is gain
So what it matters when
We're gonna live forever

So if I'm hit by a car or taken out by disease
You ain't gotta enough
Bullets in your gun, man please
We're gonna live forever

Let me spit this like Lama
And throw the Word wit a hawk like Toma
So that man can see unlike nirvana
Heaven's ruled by a unique, excellent, magnificent persona

If you say you goin', you can't stand before Him, still showin'
On your life credit report still owin'
'Cause the grass you growin'
Is the kinda of grass thats gonna catch mowin'

Ladies get your hands up, fellas get your fist clinchin'
When we gonna stand up, dig in and war trenchin'
If you want the whole school to feel the redemption
You can't use any tool, it takes Godwrenchin'

To turn a whole generation 180, I hear the whispers of the fat lady
And the only reason she ain't singin' right now is
God got His hand on the volume, baby
Real patient ain't it

But don't take His kindness for weakness
'Cause we livin' in a time of divine sweatness
'Cause there will come a day when He'll say "Enough meekness"
And men will scatter to the hills like the Horse runnin' of the Preakness

More then your striff, more then you pain
'Cause to live is Christ and to die is gain
So what it matters when
We're gonna live forever

So if I'm hit by a car or taken out by disease
You ain't gotta enough
Bullets in your gun, man please
We're gonna live forever

Harlem shake yourself till you meet Him
Though a lot of men front, they know they need Him
Watch how you treat Him
You might as well join, 'cause your sure cant beat Him

He's the one who put the real free, in the word freedom
Especially for those who are livin' in the struggle
Just tryin' to eat and you can't shake trouble
The real rough stubble, the real Barn Rubble
All my raw dogs, no leash no muzzle

You wanna roll doubles and stand in smoke huddles
And feel like the hubble, bein' shot out the shuttle
But that's where it's subtle, pop goes the bubble
And you fall back down to earth and splash down in a puddle

The cost of the trip was, oh, so pricey
You're mad at the world all hot and spicey
Then wit' the quickness of a swoosh like Nike
Satan did his thing and dug up in your psyche

'Cause all this life gives is temporary relief
And all you really had was temporary belief
You really couldn't see the amazin' deceit
And now the threat is eternal defeat

That's why we say, get a Bible and read it in its entirety
And let God deal wit' you, you and your propriety
Check out all the cats of notoriety the variety
Of ways they deal wit' the ills of society

Let it bring sobriety, let it make you fiery
'Cause it's gonna take more then a slice of apple piety
Once you realize that there's sin and symptom
And there's lost souls and things that tempt 'em

And to Jesus there's rest and redemption
You're covered by a Hebrew 401K pension
Not to mention, you learned you lesson
No more vexin, no more stressin'
No more guessin', no more Heaven, and hell questions
No more just livin' for the blessin's, no more dressin'

Forget the ice and aggression, not my wife, no caressin'
I don't care if she's Bodiqua, Australian or Texan
And you're ain't scared to scream that to your whole section
I'm not livin' for this life, 'cause I'm livin' for the next one

Livin' for the next one
Livin' for the next one
Livin' for the, livin' for the, livin' for the
Livin' for the next one

More then your striff, more then you pain
'Cause to live is Christ and to die is gain
So what it matters when
We're gonna live forever

So if I'm hit by a car or taken out by disease
You ain't gotta enough
Bullets in your gun, man please
We're gonna live forever

More then your striff, more then you pain
'Cause to live is Christ and to die is gain
So what it matters when
We're gonna live forever

So if I'm hit by a car or taken out by disease
You ain't gotta enough
Bullets in your gun, man please
We're gonna live forever
