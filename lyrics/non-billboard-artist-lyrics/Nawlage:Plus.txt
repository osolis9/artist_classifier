Baby let me whisper in your ear,
We in the perfect the perfect atmosphere,
You smile from what you hear,
And you can tell that I'm glad your here,
Looking like a model, I'm cuffing you in a bottle,
I don't wanna leave, when you go, I wanna follow,
Winding with her, it feels so rite,. no I don't want to leave this club tonite (creeping with her...)

Sipping on patron with you (you) you (you) you,
All alone with you (you) you (you) you, baby

Sipping on patron with you (you) you (you) you,
All alone with you (you) you (you) you, baby...
