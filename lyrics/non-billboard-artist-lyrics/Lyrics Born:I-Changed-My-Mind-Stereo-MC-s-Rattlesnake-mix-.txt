(feat. The Poets Of Rhythm)
Well I came at you a young boy, girl
With no experience.
Year in year out
We had our ups and downs
But I always took it serious.
I made a joke
I played the fool
I took time, made all the plans.
I know I told you that we were
Supposed to have something
Made for this weekend
But I changed my mind.
I changed my mind.
I changed my mind
I changed my mind
And I changed my mind
Well it started getting cozy, girl
I let you control the reins.
And despite what I knew to be true
I'd hoped that things would change.
I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.
But I just let it whiz on by.
People say "L-B it's goin awry!"
And I'd flip up say "that's not right."
Now I see my shit's not tight.
Now I changed my mind
[CHORUS]
Well lookin back now
I was a young man, girl.
In hindsight I regret.
I never listen to my better judgement
So my blind side got the best of me.
But we live and learn.

What you did in turn
Made me never have to settle for less.
And would I deserve and once you mature girl
You'll always be second best.
[CHORUS]
I'd even say I can't completely blame
But I even take 'cause was situations in
Retrospect with the things you say
Would shift direction when put into action.
But I just let it whiz on by.
People say "L-B it's goin awry!"
And I'd flip up say "that's not right."
Now I see my shit's not tight.
It really pains me to say things change
But your limitations would've held me back.
The things you say try to underrate me
They were just a reflection of your self-respect.
But now I let it whiz on by.
You can't tell me LB can't fly!
Kiss my wings, you can't hypnotize me!
Hear the M-singer singin this bye-bye.
I changed my mind bout this here relationship
That you've become so complacent with.
I've changed my mind.
You've sacrificed everything we had
For a happenin' price.
Changed my mind, plain and simple
Now tame and gentle
Changed my mind, i tried
I kept it quiet now why the hell
Ya wanna go and advertise?
