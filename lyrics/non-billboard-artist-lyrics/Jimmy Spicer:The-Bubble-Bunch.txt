Well once upon a time there lived a couple as fat as they could be
So what they did was get together and started a family tree
Well year by year the tree did grow
They might've been fat, but they wasn't slow
And now they're known as the Bubble Bunch
And if they wasn't eatin dinner, they was eatin lunch

Dig it
Well one day as they ate their lunch
The disco bug bit the Bubble Bunch
I heard one Bubble to another Bubble say
"I've been bit before, but never this way"
So later that night they all got dressed
The Bubble Bunch put on their Sunday best
And three of them decided to go
Where Super Rhymes rocked the disco
Well on my way to the jam to rock the beat
I seen these people comin down the street
Who were lookin like six at first to me
Turned out only to be three
It was (the Bubble Bunch)

Check it out
Well they paid their money to come inside
And do stuff that they never tried
I had never seen a Bubble free
But these three Bubbles could move to me
Well half the night they danced away
A-bubble-bumpin anybody in the way
But the Bubble Bunch was hungry now
When the food started passin around
They didn't care what people think
They ate the groovy, even if it stink
It was (the Bubble Bunch)

Well they ate the food till there was no more
And then they headed for the door
But before they left, they had to say
"Now you rock the Bubble Bunch way
You seen us dance, you heard the song
We're here to eat and run, so we have to warn
We're the (Bubble Bunch)"
