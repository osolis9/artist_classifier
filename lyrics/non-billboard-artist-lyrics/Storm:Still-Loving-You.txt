Still Loving You
Late in the night, darling your love I could use
And I walk till it's light, thinking of things that we used to do
I can still see your eyes as you stood in the doorway
And told me you found someone new
After it all, baby, I'm still loving you

Time after time, I still keep thinking of you
And as hard as I try, I can't stop the memory from cutting through
I've tried to find love in the arms of another
I've done everything I can do
After it all, baby, I'm still loving you

(Loving you) I'm in love with you
(Still loving you) there's not much I can do
It's hard to take, but I just can't deny that it's true
(Loving you) So in love with you, (still loving you) there's not much I can do
My heart keeps reminding me, baby, I'm still loving you

Look at me now, I've got everything I should need
And I've made it somehow, everyone knows it but me
I can have anything, anything I can dream of
You're one dream that just won't come true
Look at me now, baby, I'm still loving you

(Loving you) So in love with you, (still loving you) there's not much I can do
It's hard to take, but I just can't deny that it's true, yeah yeah
(Loving you) yeah yeah
(Still loving you) girl you know you know you know it's true
My heart keeps reminding me, baby, I'm still loving you
You know you know you know it's true

(Loving you, still loving you
It's hard to take, I just can't deny that it's true
Loving you, still loving you
My heart keeps reminding me, baby, I'm still loving you)

Still loving you, still loving you, still loving you
