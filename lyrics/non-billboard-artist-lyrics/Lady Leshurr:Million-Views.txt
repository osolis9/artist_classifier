Million-Views:Lady Leshurr
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
I woke up one morning, then I brushed my teeth
I got into the bath, then I changed my panties
I made sure that the weave don't smell like cornbread
I looked at the views and thought I'm about to be bigger than foreheads
Oh yes I put on my Jordans, then I leave the house it's important
I jump in an Uber, he ain't playing no music, awkward
Yo driver give me the AUX, I've got to go, take me to North
Don't wanna chat, don't wanna talk
Just play my track and turn it up, ‘cause real talk
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
I just rubbed my eyes like "huh?", one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
One million views, one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
One million views, one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
I get out of the car and I say thanks for the ride (Safe boss)
I walk to my destination, then I go inside
Order a drink at the bar, then I get seated
I didn't think that throwing shade would get me all of these meetings
It's mad ting (It's mad) oh yeah it's a mad ting (It's mad)
‘Cause I've just kept it real and them gyal are acting (They're fake)
I've put in the work star, I've put in the passion (Of course)
And now I'm a world star and they love the accent, it's a madness
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
I just rubbed my eyes like "huh?", one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
One million views, one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
One million views, one million views
I woke up one morning, saw one million views
One million, one million
One million, one million
One million, one million
One million, one million
It's crazy man
2015 has been a sick year for me boy
Big up everyone that's been supportive
Trust me Shurrporters I got you man
One million views
Views, views, views, views
Now I'm gassed, real talk
Thank you everybody man
It's my time, Queen of the Scene
