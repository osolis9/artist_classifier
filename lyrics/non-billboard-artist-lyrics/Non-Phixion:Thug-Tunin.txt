Thug-Tunin:Non-Phixion
: It's just another one of those --NON PHIXION -- jams, you know what I'm sayin'?:
: And it goes like this...:
Thug One, Thug Two (4x)
I crack you like a twig
You're like a faggot rocking a wig
The adopted kid, obnoxious stepchild
Your real mom is a pig
That's how I classify these dumb crabs
But look at that, your gun jammed
You come in handy when the pussy bleeding
But you the pussy bleeding right now
But no you ain't dreaming
Just because we righteous doesn't mean we ain't scheming
How the fuck you think we kill devils and slay demons?
You be the type to smoke the [...] blunts to semen
We hit your wife off, barely heard that slut screaming
PCP and marijuana had a dusty meeting last evening
Ohh shit, I think your mom's beeping
Word, that's her number, no doubt
First I'll get some Chinese take-out
Parked on the corner, but your mother still be waiting for me
But I broke out before the story cause those devils never saw me
Cats locked down, killers hang themselves with a sheet
No peace, in fact no need for bein' sweet, don't even try to sleep
I'm full-length [with a snipper tape?]
Cause you're trainin' Jakes and your ass in flakes
That dictates what a fag you are
Up in drag, stagger Zanzibar
Rocking tennis shorts, full of cum sports, like Benatar
Fuck a fifty-four, I lace y'all with the clean and jerk
Smoke a fucking pound and watch your stats go berserk
I terrorize whole cities, you gots to feel my work
Mexican cats with shades, every di-ay we blaze
Then the bass pump like Flavor Flav (YEAHH BOYYYEE)
I [shame] save for dark days
[...] a fatal car chase
Crusin' up flatlands until I hit Ralph
Caught the stench of the rotten projects
Bang a left and I'm out
So there's a back seat of a black jeep, I pack heat
Me and Black Pete, down a backstreet where fiends and crack meet
Went to Fat Beats, saw this kid who had beef
Made a rap sheet, said he want to blast me, attack me
Look at the floor, Duke, that's where your gat be
While your man said "Pick it up, pick it up," like Black Sheep
This cat, I'mma kill, pass me the Mac heat
Blast him in his back-piece
Step him off with a trash beat
Fucking asshole! This kid bloodied up my khakis
And stop, stop fronting you bitch, you're bypassing
Zoo York, like Vinnie Ponte
Or Noam Chomsky
Ah, fuck it, like Phil Bronstein
Kill with the velocity of T-3
Three years before the movie got out
Like Jack Ruby with the gat out
Gotta give a shout out, to Goretex
Tay-K, engineering this, steering this
It's like a Love Boat
Or William S. Burroughs plug boat
Smell the gunsmoke, get your thug broke, like uncut coke
With no clientele to sell it to
Internal revenue, there's many levels to
We taking over airports
Popping champagne corks like Puffy
Non Phixion, vampire slayers like Buffy
