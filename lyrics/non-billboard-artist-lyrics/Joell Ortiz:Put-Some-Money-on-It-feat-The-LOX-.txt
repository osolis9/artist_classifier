Yeah, Don Corlito flyin out a Tito
The further I get the ground look more mosquito
Dutch burnin, other hand big Mojito
I don't mean Dorito when I say (Put some money on it)
Yeah, you ain't really all around all that stuff
The coke, the crack, the guns, heard 'bout enough
They said, "Yo Donny, you gon' really sign with Puff?"
I said I'll live too long as Diddy (Put some money on it)
What? I'm the L.O.X. Jeter
Tattooed up in a white wife-beater
Aston Vanquish parked at the meter
I forgot to feed her, better go(Put some money on it)
Yeah, now they all love the Don G
I'm on BET more than "Leprechaun 3"
They say I'm on fire, it don't hurt when I pee
I don't layaway, only y'all (Put some money on it)

Yaowa! Whoever, whenever, put some 'fetti on it
If your block is hood I'm probably heavy on it
Probably popped the hood, of the Chevy on it
Did the Mario Andretti on it - ERRRT! (Put some money on it)
Brooklyn off the hook when Ortiz is there
Papi got it locked like peasy hair
Black and white TV's, please be clear
I'll erase your lil' buzz like Jeezy peers (Put some money on it)
Fam, I'm the man far as New York goes
Old four-five in my new wardrobe
Red dot in front like Rudolph's nose
Case a hater want his roof un-closed(Put some money on it)
I'll be by myself, think of somethin sweet
I'm Boricua, one lil' whistle I'm a hundred deep
Who been holdin niggaz down since Pun is sleep?
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! (Put some money on it)

AH-HAH! Never been wack so that ain't one of my issues
Get my bread and take care of my pistols
Soon as I open a brick you can see the crystals
Soon as the piff come in you can (Put some money on it)
Trust me it's imported, shoot it or snort it
Oxy's, {?}, profit is gorgeous
Stay off the phone cause the calls are recorded
And if you can afford it then you better(Put some money on it)}
Tryin to be a diamond in the game I been one
Killin niggaz with the flow, H1N1
You can get a buck-fifty quick, a thin one
Before rap I had a drug dealer's income
{"Put some money on it"} Master Jason
God on the rocks with a splash of Satan
Stash right here with the ratchet waitin, since you hatin
Name the place and the date and (Put some money on it)

Never trust niggaz no further than I can throw 'em
Long with the razor and the doctor can't sew 'em
Said I as the hardest out, now I gotta show 'em
Cocksucker doubted me, I owe 'em (Put some money on it)
You could be that dude in cement shoes
or the next soft nigga on this evening's news
Rap beef, street beef, breeze through crews
Freeze, handguns, machine guns (Put some money on it)
I don't even need guns, play me like I'm poppa shit
End up with a hawk in your esophagus
Hardest nigga to walk in the metropolis
Genocide mixed with apocalypse (Put some money on it)
Kill niggaz real easy dawg
Ghost in the flesh, fuck a Ouija Board
Droptop Beamer with the BB's on
Gun in your face, and I ain't shootin BB's dawg (Put some money on it)
