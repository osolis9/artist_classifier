True-Stories-II:Jumpsteady
From my haunted dream I do slowly awake
Lyin' still in my dark room that now seems to suffocate
My hands are sheet grippin' as the nightmare got me trippin'
Need to get outta bed cause I feel my life slippin'
An eerie wind lifts causin' my house to shift
As my open closet seems like a gate to hell's pit
Vision of a woman's death remains from my dream
As an echo haunts my mind of her ghostly screams
From forgotten realms filled with shadow things
Where death becomes born and nightmares bring
Those things that slowly creep in the night as we sleep
Otherwordly beings who seep from the shadow deep
Everyone has seen what could never be explained
But they file it deep in their mind as merely insane
Wether you choose to believe me or don't believe
Our 3rd dimension remains only one known reality

Won't you step up through the gate
Will you face up to your fate
Don't you hear the ghostly calls
Transcending from beyond our walls
Won't you enter the shadow land
And walk upon the emerald sand
Have you seen what I have seen
Or do you choose to be naive

Off highway 80 there exists a haunted place
There an old sanitarium on a hill sits and wastes
Thousand horribly died there over the course of time
It's where the terminally ill were sentenced to die
Now many abandon buildings do stand askew
Surrounded by deep woods where ghostly sounds spew
We went there me and my friends on a dare
To survive one night as we were encased in fear
I seen things then that I could never explain
Had vision of a bloody hall mixed with pain
Seen a door open and close of its own accord
Felt the temperature drop down low in the sick ward
We took photos everywhere within its old walls
What was later developed caused my skin to crawl
There in the photos floating beside our heads
Were the ghostly orbs or the tormented dead

There exists a barren road known to bring the fear
It lies deep in the woods with no town or city near
Where monks will attack any who tests their fate
With their vow of silence they're known to whistle to communicate
It's always been my nature to explore the unknown
It was on Devil's Night when we walked the road
The trees above constantly swayed in the eerie wind
As they blocked out moonlight with no give
The dirt road twisted as we saw many strange things
Then we turned a corner as the silence did bring
A whistling sound which began repeating all around
Some far away and others close by kinda loud
Our blood then froze on that desolate road
We then continued in fear and saw a sinister abode
A monk monastery as wicked as could ever be
Far from the road vast dark and full of mystery
We explored by hoppin' back and forth over barb-wire
When suddenly the air was filled with gunfire
We ran for our lives as I saw where a clearing lied
There stood a dozen monks shooting at us side by side
