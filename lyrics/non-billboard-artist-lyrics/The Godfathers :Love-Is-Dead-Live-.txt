Love-Is-Dead-Live-:The Godfathers 
Though she was still a little girl
She was a woman of the world
She used to sit upon my knee
And put the sugar in my tea
No no no, no no no
And now you'll never realise
Till that smoke gets in your eyes
That love is blind and cannot see
And this is how it's meant to be
No no no, no no no
No no no, no no no
And now I'd walk on broken glass
To hold her hand like in the past
You always hurt the one you love
You need a sign from up above
No no no, no no no
Though she was still a little girl
She was a woman of the world
She used to sit upon my knee
And put the sugar in my tea
No no no, no no no
Yes
