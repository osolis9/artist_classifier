Matthew:Kish
I'm sorry Matthew
But you don't mean a thing
I'm sorry Matthew
I don't mean to phase you
But you don't own me
You wouldn't want to

I'm sorry Matthew
But it's how it's gonna be
I'm sorry Matthew
It's only Monday
Why don't you step on the scene I'm going my way

It's so easy
It's so cozy
Uh oh

Chorus (x2):
Strawberry fool
I'm losing my taste for you
It's all I can do
But it feels good

I'm sorry Matthew
But it's me against you
I'm sorry Matthew
I can't remember when I last loved you
I just don't want to

You're so easy (so easy)
You're so cozy (so cozy)
Uh oh

Chorus:
Strawberry fool
I'm losing my taste for you
It's all I can do
But it feels good

Strawberry fool (strawberry fool)
I'm losing my taste for you (I'm losing my taste for you)
It's all I can do (it's all I can do)
But it feels good

Running through the streets to find you
I don't know if I will find you, oh oh oh
And even if I you disappear
At least I know you'll never be near, oh oh oh

Chorus (x2)
Strawberry fool (strawberry fool)
I'm losing my taste for you (I'm losing my taste for you)
It's all I can do (it's all I can do)
But it feels good
