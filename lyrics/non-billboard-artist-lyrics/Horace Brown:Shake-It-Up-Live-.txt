Shake-It-Up-Live-:Horace Brown
It Ain't Rockin' In Me, Patient Black He's Busted Attack,
It Ain't Rockin' In Me, Let Me Bust A Freestyle Then, Aight Then

{Shake It Up} (Shake It Up In The Club, Do It Girl Like You're Making Love)
{Get Love} (Hands Up In The Air, Wave 'Em Like You Just Don't Care)
{Spread Love} (It's The Brooklyn Way, Pass The Moet And The Alizé)
{Tear It Up} (It's What I Wanna Do When I'm Loving You)

Mmm, To My Surprise, I Can't Believe My Eyes
You Look So Hot, You're Making My Temperature Rise
Your Sexy Body's Got Me Wishing
For Your Loving, Something's Kissing
Yeah Boo, I Could Say I Want To Play
But Here's What I Wanna Do

{I Wanna Drive You Crazy} Wanna Drive You Crazy
{We'll Be Ridin' On The Scene} Ride Ride
{Won't You Be My Lady} Won't You Be My Lady
{Kill That Attitude} Kill That Attitude, Baby

{Tear It Up} (It's What I Wanna Do When I'm Loving You) It's What I Wanna Do When I'm Loving You

I Can Tell You're Too Afraid To Fight Me
Simple Because You Lost The Crowd
And They Had To Invite Me Because Your Sweat Is A Puddle
But There's A Puddles Of Sweat, I'm A Threat
So Get A Cold, Wrecker Wipe Your Neck
And Clean The Dirt Off Your Face That Cause Acne
It's Ridiculous Thinking A Chick Attacked Me
This Is The Round Where They Punch To A Goal
And To Your AGAD Is As Low As A Flow

The Perfect Size, I Love Your Roomy Thighs
Your Lightened Top, You Got Me Hypnotised,
I Want To Run Debut At The Eiffel Tower
And I'll See You In About An Hour

To Make That A Bet You Won't Regret
Coz Here's What I'm Gonna Do
