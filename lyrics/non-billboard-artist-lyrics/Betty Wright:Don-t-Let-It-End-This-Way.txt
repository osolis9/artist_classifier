Don-t-Let-It-End-This-Way:Betty Wright
I watch the sun as it slowly went down
but tears falling from my eyes
I turn the tv on and try to forget
just how much I was hurting
deep down inside
Seven days and seven nights
are gone back
since me and my babe said goodbye
so I'm begging
down on my knees
come on home baby please
what more can I say?
But honey honey
sugar baby
don't let it end this way
I can't forget the simple things you used to do
all of the good things and the bad ones too
I know I'm lonely and you must be lonely too
oh, but if you come on home
baby I'll make it all up to you
Seven days and seven nights
are gone back
since me and my babe said goodbye
so I'm begging
down on my knees
come on home baby please
what more can I say?
But honey honey
sugar baby
don't let it end this way
