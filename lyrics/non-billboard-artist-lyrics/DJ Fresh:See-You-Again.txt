See-You-Again:DJ Fresh
[Chorus: Michael Warren]
Cause I, I'd give it all away
If it meant that I could see you again
The nights alone have made me see, you're the missing puzzle piece
I'd give it all away, if I could see you again
If I could see you again

[Verse: Michael Warren]
Mistakes, a twisted game we played
And I won't forget if I see you again
You think you made your move on me, now I'm broken, can't you see?
It'll be the same if I see you again
If I could see you again

[Chorus: Michael Warren]
