Pearl-Fountain-Bonus-Track:Kray
For my set I go in 
So many bitches I don't know where I been
They keep asking me what state I'm in
So many bitches I don't know where I been

(Ay, ay)
Shining, shining foreign ice
They be crying tears look like foreign ice
She look scared, need like foreign ice
Trapping out the Swedish snow, four nights
(Ay, trap, trap)
30 days and 30 nights
Dirty sad tears just like foreign ice
Squirting liquid lean in that foreign ice
Throwing fo's up yelling all aight
In my Honda
Countin' guap with Lean, slow
Hoe's coming over
Smoking on dro'

(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin)
Riding round on 4'
Don't know where my partner roll
Neon lights all I see, I think I'm gone
Ice blood on my face, I'm forever thrown
S.B.E, we some vampires, Dracula
I'm in an Acura, hoe I think you stack them up
I'm not doing calculus, I need a calculator
Glass elevator, shoes made made by Alligators
I'm flying in the sky, feeling
I'm heartless, fire lighting everywhere
Let the darkness take my heart
I put my heart on my sleeve
Stuck forever I could never leave

Saddest story ever told
I don't fuck with you I'm always with my bros
Twenty Thousand Sixteen, I need some gold
All this money, all this money make me cold
I said I cared, I really don't
What you want? I'm always switchin' up my phones
Where did I go? You'll never know
Looking for me but I'm buried under snow

For my set I go in
So many bitches I don't know where I been
They keep asking me what state I'm in
So many bitches I don't know where I been
