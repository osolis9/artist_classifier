Enth-E-nd-Kutmasta-Kurt-feat-Motion-Man-:Linkin Park
Hey yo, when this first started off, it was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all
It was Kutmasta Kurt with a remix

One thing, I don't why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time

All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
They echo in the clock, rhythm in my veins

I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock

But in the end, no matter what pretend
The journey is more important than end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory, of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

Hey, yo, one thing, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know, I so, socialize
Like the host of the party and spost shake the need
I contact, party the toe strong all mat
Northeast, southwest coast

I'm staring out the window at the opportunity to Mendel
I tried disorda, you're weak in your system
And I defordered, I brought you back into things
Like the imaginary man of your dreams

You'd always seem to make it worth it
A pig skin, I never nerved it
You felt lever never pleather, real bringing the pleasure
By any means it means I'm leaving your teens
Holler for teen magazines but I tried so hard

Tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

Linkin Park, remix, Motion Man
Linkin Park, the end, the end, Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin Park, remix, Motion Man
Linkin Park, the end, the end, Kutmasta Kurt remix

One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
'Cuz when designed this rhyme, I was scared of it all
Scared to fall and hadn't even tried to crawl

But I was forced to run with you mockin' me
Stoppin' me, back stabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watched the clock mount, chock full of hip-hopcrisy
And now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered, to just to get you peace
But it doesn't really matter to me
'Cuz from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
Tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall, to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
In the end
