Trick:IMx 
This is not a direct derogatory towards women
This is only the meaning of what a trick is

Woah
(Trick)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
At the end of the night she think it ain't fun
If the homies can't have none
(Trick)

Woah, woah, woah, woah
(Trick)
If you got a tight back
Woah, woah, woah, woah
She's in it for the night
(Trick)

I ain't, ain't the one
Back up girl you need to chill
You need to slow it down
You move too fast for me, yeah
I'm letting you know the deal

And every time you come around
You're trying to be down
But you keep getting clowned
Girl you need to quit
'Cause don't nobody love a trick

See a trick will give you some
At the end of the night she think it ain't fun
If the homies can't have none
Wanna get your thing on, it won't take long
'Cause a trick will give it up

If you got a tight back
She's in it for the night
For me she ain't the one
'Cause I need a real love
And not just a hit and run

Everybody gets to hit
It don't take much cause you're a freak
If you think he's a playa balling
You'll be on the phone calling
(Trick)
Trying to get a late night creep

And every time you come around
You're trying to be down
But you keep getting clowned
Girl you need to quit
'Cause don't nobody love a trick

See a trick will give you some
At the end of the night she think it ain't fun
If the homies can't have none
Wanna get your thing on, it won't take long
'Cause a trick will give it up

If you got a tight back
She's in it for the night
For me she ain't the one
'Cause I need a real love
And not just a hit and run

For all the girls with no class
We don't want it, we don't want it
For all the girls that move too fast
We don't need it, we don't need it

See what I need is a girl who's got my back
Now jumping in the back of every Jeep or Cadillac
A girl that don't give it up on the first date
Can you relate?

Woah, woah, woah, woah, see a trick gets her some
At the end of the night she think it ain't fun
Wanna get your thing on, it won't take long
Woah, woah, woah, woah
