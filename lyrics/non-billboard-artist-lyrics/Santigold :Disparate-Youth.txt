Disparate-Youth:Santigold 
Don't look ahead, there's stormy weather
Another roadblock in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay

Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
Oh, how to win what they all lost

Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for

So let them say we can't do better
Lay out the rules that we can't break
They wanna sit and watch you wither
Their legacy's too hard to take

Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
Oh, how to win what they all lost

Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for

In their heads, hedging their bets
In their eyes it shows
When the beacon breaks, what then?
You ask and they don't know
Oh, tell me that
I turn my back while the odds all stand beneath me
And they all said I was misled
But now the odds all stand beneath me

Oh ah, oh ah
They're frozen to the core
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out

Oh, how to win what they all lost
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh ah, oh ah
We know now we want more
Oh ah, oh ah
A life worth fighting for
(We hear them run, but don't hear what you say)
(Now here we come, can't throw nothing in our way)
