40 in my hand but nigga I jack one
Slap one, cut a-fuckin-head to the fat one
Been about it, ask about me, nigga I'nt no fuckin joke
Nigga play with me then up in smoke his ass a go
I don't give a fuck about a charge, nigga know that
Pounding all street goons nigga and I show that
Choppa bullets rain on yo ass, where you go at
Tear that bitch down, have yo face but I flow at
Cap on dog, I'mma burn me a nigga today
Fool brought my money, I don't mind catching a fuckin case
Get down, like the mob, in my hood they raise me
Niggas start a problem then that nigga gotta pay me

Jack one, snack one, run up with your sacks up
Anybody boom boom boom, give it up or I'mma shoot
Jack one, snack one, run up with your sacks up
Anybody boom boom boom, give it up or I'mma shoot

Who wan' a war with a nigga like me?
I done done time, been a beast in these streets
I done done crime nigga you can ask the skreets
Nigga I ain't lyin, I was raised in the streets
I do yo ass back on these fuckin round me
Call my goons from the side, watch em fly to Tennessee
Man we a kill every snitch we think will testify
Let's see how many motherfuckers wanna test me now
Hand on the trigger and nigga I do it
Dog I don't give a fuck, it ain't nothing to it
Robbery my specialty, your pockets full of thug
I ride by myself cuz I don't trust none

Jack one, snack one, run up with your sacks up
Anybody boom boom boom, give it up or I'mma shoot
Jack one, snack one, run up with your sacks up
Anybody boom boom boom, give it up or I'mma shoot
