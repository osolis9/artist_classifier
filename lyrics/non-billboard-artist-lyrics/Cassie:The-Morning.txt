The-Morning:Cassie
All you need*
Is me all up on ya
I can give you that energy
I got your baby
Yes um now look at me
With me up on your arm
You can get anything
And everything, oh yeah

Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute, yeah
Everything I do
I be making them stare
You know I look good
In everything I wear
You see me over here
Why you way over there

If you don't keep it hot
Don't keep it fresh
Don't keep it fly
Baby you gets no love
Gotta get you (all the time)
If you can get it right
Then you can rock this (rock this)

Now you could be
Over here selling me how you gone
Spend your time rocking me
Instead of over there telling yo' boys
My walk is mean
I thought boys were notorious
For talkin' B.I.G
'Bout everything, oh yeah

Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute, yeah
Everything I do
I be making them stare
You know I look good
In everything I wear
You see me over here
Why you way over there

If you don't keep it hot
Don't keep it fresh
Don't keep it fly
Baby you gets no love
Gotta get you (all the time)
If you can get it right
Then you can rock this (rock this)
