A-Million-Years:Alexander Ebert
I love you like grave danger
Like moon shining disguise
Mmm hmm
When I wake up with your makeup
And spread blush cross the sky

Like a meteor crush
I'm gonna tell the world
Been a million years full of tears
But I found my girl

My notion of love devotion
Was a corrosion of mind
Mmm hmm
Then come cupid and now I'm stupid
And I feel it's just fine

Like exploding face
I'm gonna tell the world
Been a million years full of fears
But I found my girl

It's a spun tongue
It's a holy shit
It's a loud cry from the heart
It's a live death
It's a big breath
It's a no more we're apart

Like a rainbow crash
As we bow and swirl
Been a million years full of tears
But I found my girl

Like exploding sun
Let the light unfurl
Been a million years full of fears
But I found my girl
