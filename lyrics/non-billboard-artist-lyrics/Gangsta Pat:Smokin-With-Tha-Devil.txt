Smokin-With-Tha-Devil:Gangsta Pat
I'm wakin out of my sleep
And I'm thinkin
I'm dreamin
I feel like I'm goin insane
I can just feel
The presence of an unknown spirit inside me controllin my brain
Tryin to get me to commit bloody murder
For money and set niggas up on that stain
Visions of demons be screamin
And fiendin for spirits
Some niggas that fucked up the game
I'm comin out of my bed
With a head full of thoughts
That might get me locked up in a cell
Lookin for weapons
I'm steppin up off
And I'm caught when I'm lost
I'm exhausted as well
Suddenly out of the ground
A vision appears
It's such a demonly form
Thunder and lightning so frightening
And darkness cover the sky
While my body is warm
I feel like I'm goin insane
I feel no pain
I wanna break free but I'm frozen
Am I forbidden to die
By the fact that I'm trapped
By curse of the devil has chosen
All of my for real all my nigga
The spirit is bigger that life and larger than death
I'm hidin
I'm hydro ventilating
Waitin for satin to show
And I'm holdin my breath
But will he appear
Will he just come and collect
Elements from my body and soul
Or will he come kill me
And drill me
With teeth in my stomach
And pump me
Goin to be until I become swolle
I'm tyin to be brave
And I fear no evil
For nothing
Cause I know that he's on a hunt
I pull out a swisher
And split it
And lit it
And hit it
And pass the devil a blunt

Let me hit that
This is some good shit
Wrong again mother fucker

The devil got high
And we sat and talked about life
And I asked hI'm was hell any fun
He told me it would be
Chaos killin stealin dealin
And murder from dusk until dawn
Then he said demons
Would come from the streets
Like police and kill anyone seen doin good
Crack would given to people that's livin
?
That walk through the hood
He spoke about so many things that sounded like a lie
So I said to myself this ain't real
He found out that I was in doubt
And he jumped in my spirit
And he made me rupture and kill
Innocent people for nothin
I pulled out my glock
And started bustin at woman at random
And I'm spittin off Images
Faces out callers
Cause its true
I really can't stand them
Catchin up niggas
It's perfect
Cause I got the erg
And I'm fillin up
And holes in my head
Rewrite the exorcist
Next is the school with I. Q.
With my nine up and I fill full of lead
The devil jumped out of me
Then he appeared and showed me pictures of the bodies I slayed
I couldn't believe what I did
So I tried to break free
But he captured me just like a slave
He took me to ten
He told me to look down
And there I was standing on my grave
I tried to jump up but I couldn't
I started sinking
I'm thinking I gotta stay brave
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere
With nothin but fighting
I pray for the demons on hunt
But that's what I get for thinking I could sit with the devil
And joke and smoke on a blunt

(Laughs)
You stupid mother fucker
(Laughs)
Your gunna burn
Your gunna burn!
(Laughs)

The devil took me to a spot
And I watched as he sacrificed
So many souls of the living
The nigga that that's one with no heart
And niggas that kill
Are considered t be a forgiven
They put them on crosses
And burn them with children
And I watch as they blow
And go up in smoke
The stench from the bodies so strong and
It's making me sick to my stomach
As I start to choke
I'm tremblin and shakin
And feelin so strange
And I'm changin into somehtin
What's goin on
My soul has been takin control of
With all of the haters inside me
Makin me do wrong
The devils a serpent
Inside me I feel hI'm
Well what should I do
Should I stop and give in
Or should I just pray to the man in the sky
Before I die and he makes me commit a sin
I'm askin for help
And I'm screamin out
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
(Laughs)

2X
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the lord m soul to take

In other words nigga (echoed)
You need to quit smokin blunts with the mother fucking devil (echoed)
Believe that shit (echoed)
The devil a low down mother fucker (echoed)
He ain'ts to be fucked with (echoed)
