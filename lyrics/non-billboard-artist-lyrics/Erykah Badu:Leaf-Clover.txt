Leaf-Clover:Erykah Badu
Buzilla baby

Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way

Here I am, on a cloud
If you want me take the chance try love out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting cupid's loving arrow you just might try

So don't miss babe
Take your time
You've only got one chance, yes

Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Catch a four leaf clover
Love my getcha over

Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way

Like the way I am free
Going places, being things I wanna be
Settle down, is oh so hard
But I will pray you that one chance

So pick the right one
And don't miss it, take your time
You only got one chance

Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Catch a four leaf clover
Love my getcha over

Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way

Free as a bird, yeah, yeah, yeah
To catch me is to catch a leprechaun
Hold on to your rabbit's foot
I just might be yours forever you better

Catch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
