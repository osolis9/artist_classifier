Bitch betta have my money
Ahh! Shit, here we go on the one ya'll with nothin' to clown

It ain't nothin' like black pussy on my dick
Word to the motherfuckin' DJ Quik
I play hoes like dominos, slappin' bones
AMG's on the motherfuckin' microphone

I slang dick bitch nothin' more and nothin' less
You got a C-no hoe, you can take the test
And bring big fat titties and lots of back
You got the woody and I gotta ask

I'm no joke when I stroke for a client
Bitches need dick, so they buyin' it
G with the high top fade
Open up ya coach bag, bitch, so I can get laid

And take off your G-string drawers
Bitch eat your Wheaties, 'cause I don't pause
What are you laughin' at, ain't a damn thing funny
Bitch, betta have my money

I don't charge by the inch, I charge by the foot
Think I'm lyin', bitch here take a look
100 percent U.S. D.E.A grade
A beef, here's my card, call me

You looked like you ain't been bumped in a while
Pick up the motherfuckin' phone and dial
And have your money in a big ass stack
I'm slingin' this dick like a newjack, so

Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money

Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money

Choose the position pronto or you're on the clock
You can suck the diggity-dick, but I'ma charge you a knot
Bend your ass on over and touch your toes
Hold your breath, 'cause I'ma hold my nose

This dick of mine ain't friendly, baby
Will it hurt you, yeah, maybe
Probably, because I'm 19 years old
I fuck hot pussy until it's cold

I ain't a prostitute, but I'll knock the boots
Women love me and say I'm so cute
Girls wanna get with me, I tell ya
A big ol' bunch and a smile and Pussy ain't nothin' but a game to me
Pockets are fat, 'cause I play them freaks
So when a ho wanna fuck to the throw of a teenage pimp
I wanna see that rip so

Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money

Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money

Motherfuckers out there can't fade me
And bitches out there don't phase me
I take it blow for blow, a ho is a ho
A bitch is a bitch is a bitch

So fuck all the rigmarole
I clap the dough when I slap the flow
She's gonna do it to ya slow while ya sing along ho
Bitch betta have my money

Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money

Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
Bitch betta have my money
