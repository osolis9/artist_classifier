I Do 'em
[erick onasis]
No game, for no-names
On the mic i spit flames, rockwells to janes
I'm the nicest without me in the game
It's a crisis - i control all mic devices
Scratch and e yo, we keep shit poppin
Control the mic, keep spittin and keep droppin
Lose 'em or bruise 'em, ruin 'em
Keep the madface screwin 'em
Keep pursuin 'em, keep doin 'em
All night til the crowd start booin
And when we get thumped by uh, nuf and clue and them
Yo, i keep shit comin from the bassment
Make hardcore cats take the route that mase went
Not the god, but just plain quick
From fuckin with that d-e-f squadron shit
This is my house, i told you before
Trespass on my shit, i catch you at the door
Jump off the rail, from the second floor
And kill you in here, without breakin the law
I do 'em, do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
I do 'em, do 'em somethin awful
