Desires-In-Conflict:Flame
Yea, I wanna tell ya'll this story
It's a lot of people looking for restoration
And really searching

I met an interesting man
Who confessed some of the struggles within
Brace yourself cause the struggle is deep
Cause the struggle is deep
He wrestles with the very complex thing
And this is what he said to me

You don't understand my pain
You don't understand my secret
The type of depression I sleep with
It's been going on
Every since I was six years old
My greatest fear is still being exposed
My emotions cross wires
Causing a sexual crossfire
Now I have conflicting desires
As a distraction
Same sex attraction
In my actions and emotional breakdown just like fractions
See, people even say that I'm wrong
But people need to leave me alone
Just check Dateline
And the news will even show you
The hate crimes
I would see God but why waste time
I'm so embarrassed
I try to change
But it just won't work
I felt ashamed when I stepped in the church
I feel isolated
Child of trauma
I try to forget that while dealing with these struggles and set backs
I been around

Man... it's got to be tough man
I don't know what to say

I met an interesting woman
Who confessed some of her struggles within
Brace yourself cause her struggle is deep (cause her struggle is deep)
She wrestles with the very complex thing
And this is what she said to me

You don't understand my pain
You don't understand my struggle
Never hearing a man say that I love you
Without something in mind
Yea, I grew up as a classic tomboy
When I was young I used to clown boys
It was so funny
But then the jokes stopped when he grabbed my throat
And I got raped looked around and there was no pops
Then I resented and hated men my friends then
But I never dated men for a long time
When I did I became promiscuous
Involved in sexual experiences
That I shouldn't been
Never felt feminine til I met a friend
Who really took the time just to understand
It became more than a friendship
One day when her hand slipped
I tried to change but that's the way that I am
Please accept me for the way that I am
Please, I been around

Wow... that's deep... um
I don't know

And when they shared their secrets
It was very hard to speak
But I knew they wanted me to respond (they wanted me to respond)
I closed my eyes and said a prayer to God
Lord please help me speak your mind

I don't understand your pain (I don't)
And I don't and your secrets (I don't)
The type of depression you sleep with
But I sympathize
I really do
Know it's gotta be hard
Being you so I try to be true
And I try to empathize
But I know that God wants to express a sacredness
Through opposite sex
Yes through opposite sex
For man and woman to become one
Is the union God wanted to bless
Yes, He wants to bless
It paints a picture of His desire for oneness
With us in a relationship we can be with the Father
He's always faithful
He'll never molest or disrespect His sons and daughters
You can bet on this
His love is deeper than the ocean floor
The blood of Jesus is the open door
To forgive us for our sins
And He can restore the void in a woman
And He can restore the men to men from homosexual sin

See a person's race or ethnicity is sacred
Our sexuality is sacred as well
And it's a gift from God
We don't have the right to do with it what we want to
God has an original intent
Just like I can't go off and participate in any type of sexual act that I want to with
My sexuality pornography premarital sex adultery
So what is it with our sexuality
Concerning homo sexuality
God has established
The divine order
And we must follow
