Call-Me-Anytime:PYT
I see your album in the Billboard
Your video's on TRL
We haven't spoken since the springtime
You got my number and your cell
I remember all the sweet times
It wasn't very long ago
And now you've gone and hit the big time
I don't wanna let you go
I want you (you)
To talk to (to)
You know I miss you oh so much
I wanna hear your voice (wanna hear your voice)
Baby keep in touch (call me any)

Call me anytime
I've got you on my mind (my heart is on the line)
My heart is on the line (call me call me)
I want you to be mine
Call me anytime
I'm waiting on the line (waiting on the line)
Hit me one more time (baby one more baby one more)
I want you to be mine (want you to be mine)

I know you've got my number
I'm waiting
Call me anytime

I ain't drivin' with nobody else
It's time we break it down to real (to real)
Don't wanna put my heart up on the shelf
I don't think I have to tell you how I feel (to feel)
I hope to see you 'round the way soon
Not just in a magazine
Get back to where we left off
And wake me from this dream
I want you (you)
To talk to (to)
You know I miss you oh so much
I wanna hear your voice (wanna hear your voice)
Baby keep in touch (call me any)

Call me anytime
I'm waiting on the line
I want you to be mine (be mine)
Call me anytiiiiiiiiiiime

Call me anytime
I've got you on my mind (and I miss you)
My love is on the line
I want you to be mine (want you to be mine)
Call me anytime (call me baby)
I'm waiting on the line (anytime)
Hit me one more time
I want you to be mine
Call me anytime
You know what
Call me anytime
I've got you on my mind
I wanna hear your voice
Please keep in touch
Call me
