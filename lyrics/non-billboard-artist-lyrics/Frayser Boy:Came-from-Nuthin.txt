So I'm like a mall now

Remember I used to smoke on ridge
I'm blowin strong now

These bitches go on now
They call my phone now
They used to doubt me
Now these hoes won't leave me alone now

I'm paper chasin
Mostly niggas be hatin
These haters they feel threatened
By the moves a nigga makin now

I get it in
Naw, it ain't no lookin' back
'Cause if I do
I'll be back up in the kitchen cookin crack

Same niggas used to laugh
now I'm movin like a boss
Fuck the laws I'm tryin to win
fuck these niggas let 'em talk

From the bottom to the top
from the grind up to the sky
I'm a keep on gettin this money
Till the day a nigga die
And that's for real!

I came from nuthin

Fuck her and her friend now
It ain't no limit
to the paper that I spend now

A celebration now
Yeah these niggas hatin now
They used to doubt me
Now I hear congratulations now

It feel good
when you come up from the hood
Poppin bottles in the club
Bout no steel it ain't no love

I was down and now I'm up
I ain't never going back
Cheese stack, better stack
I'm gon make that money back

I ain't never had shit
So I'm a live it to the full
Goin' strong so shit be chokin
Every time you take a pull

I'm the realest nigga in it
You don't like it get in line
You can catch me on the grind
