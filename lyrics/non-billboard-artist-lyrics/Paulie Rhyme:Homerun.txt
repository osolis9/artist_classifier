Homerun:Paulie Rhyme
Yeah I know you got few, and I know I got the one,
But I gotta take a swing, maybe hit that homerun,
Cause girl you outta sight, I must outta mind
Too close, we too right, I hope out im not outta line
Its like a everyday occurrence, when I walk in spot,
Sometimes I be late, catching them smacks before they drop,
I see the clock, the train was late then I giv'em a shrug,
Bout to get down the hall, not looking love,
But ya walk give me chills, I ain't even got to turn,
I know its you, calf muscles like they feel the burn,
High heels, high skills, on that corporate path,
My job is dead end, a raise, boss just laugh,
But its cool, its pay bills, Got no time to complain,
Your perfume from down the hall drive a brother insane,
You pop in ya head in, and I just give you the nod,
Cause I'm on the phone grinding, try to find another job,
Or I'm working, you can't tell the hours a blur,
But when you come back through, im like "what's up with you girl"?
We chop it up, small talk, then you tell me bout them,
All ya'll dudes, how you smooth, and they fly you on trips,
Yeah I know you got few, and I know I got the one,
But I gotta take a swing, maybe hit that homerun,
Cause girl you outta sight, I must outta mind
Too close, we too right, I hope out im not outta line
Conversation just continue and we both lose time,
I feel your grind, I just listen, cause Im cool with mine,
We real comfortable like buddies ain't no reason to trip,
But when you get up to a walkout a "damn" just slip,
You just giggle and I try to just cough it off,
You tell me you'll see me later and ya voice so soft,
I throw some water on my face, try to get back right,
But then dreams take control in the mid of the night,
A straight page from them late flicks on tv,
You back in my office, strutting, all hear is Stevie,
Next day I'm early, lined up, trying hard to impress,
But I don't see you, and deflates my chest,
Then I'm looking at my pictures of my girl on my desk,
Then I start to laugh, thinking my ego's a mess,
Grab some flowers on the way home, with a few steaks,
Kiss my girl as I walk in, feeling good, feeling great.
Yeah I know you got few, and I know I got the one,
But I gotta take a swing, maybe hit that homerun,
Cause girl you outta sight, I must outta mind
Too close, we too right, I hope out im not outta line
