[ Kangol Kid ]
Let's get it on, what's the beef?
Is it my breath? No problem, I'll brush my teeth
There's really no reason why you should flake
Unless you got somethin you think I'll take
Whatever you got, homegirl, keep it kept
In due respect Kangol will step
To another young lady that'll keep him warm
Hey, what would you say if I said (let's get it on)

[ Educated Rapper MD ]
Full-settin introducin, you know the proceedure
If you don't cooperate with me, I don't need ya
Cause if you ain't droppin, I'll stop clockin
And all the pretty girls I don't know I be rockin
British by birth and I'll well endowed
And frontin on me is just not allowed
And if you don't give me what I'm askin you for
You can meet my friend, the door

So long
She woulda got it on

You ugly skeezer

Let's get it on
Let's get it on

[ Doctor Ice ]
Can I get a witness that this girl is fine?
I never seen her, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm imaginin how her body would be
Come, get to this, mercy, mercy me
You got to give it up, you need sexual healing
I'm not a troubled man, this is what I'm feeling
You were sanctified, lady, from the day you were born
Distant lover - what's goin on?

Let's get it on
Let's get it on
Let's get it on
(I want you, skeezer)
Let's get it on

[ Kangol Kid ]
I used to think that you was treatin me wrong
It took a while, I admit, but I caught on
Every day I kept my hands in my pocket
Wonderin when was I gonna knock it
The more I think about it, the more is sweat
The harder you make it, the harder I get
If I didn't want you, baby, I wouldn't've wrote the song
How much I got to pay ya, girl, to make you say (let's get it on)

[ Educated Rapper MD ]
I love it, girl, when you sit down with me
And if I'm too straight to the point, please, forgive me
I let my fingers do the walkin too much
Come to think about it, that's really not such
A terrible gesture, I should test ya
Tried to get ya even though I just met ya
And if I'm lucky and my rap is strong
You might change your mind and say (let's get it on)

Yo Buckwheat
I'ma give you some light on this one
"Ooh, do that"

[ Doctor Ice ]
See, I'm a stubborn kind of fellow but I know I can bring
Happiness, cause ain't nothin like the real thing
If this world were mine I'd be also true
Cause I'd truly love do be loved by you
And ain't no mountain high enough to stop this wind
I'll cold hitch-hike, that's the way love is
No need to procrastinate all night long
What other than be me (let's get it on)

[ Kangol Kid ]
Aight baby, now why you flakin
Ah, you gon' flake
Then I'm just gon' diss you

Your mother so dirty when she go take a bath,
the water jump out and say 'I'll wait'
[ *differen people in different accents* ]
Your mother so skinny, she can hula-hoop in a Cheerio
Your mother hair is so short, she rose her hair with a?
Your mother's so stupid, she got hit by a parked car
Your mother's brain?
I heard your mother has three teeth,
one in her mouth and two in her pockets
Yo, I hear your mother got a job at the airport sniffin luggage
I heard your mother glasses are so thick, she can see the future
Your mother so stupid, she asked what army Colonel Abrahams was in

Let's hear she gon'
Let's see she gon' do the do
