White-Girls:Mighty Casey
[Chorus: Mighty Casey]
White girlllllllllls, (Suzy, Jen, and Karen)
Going through my miiiiiind, (Sarah, Jesse and Julie, too)
White girlllllllllls, (Judy, Beth, and Sharon)
Help me unwiiiiiiind (The more I see the more I do)
Don't tell Minister Farrakhan (That's right)
He don't wanna know what's going on (Ok)
Cuz white girllllllllllls, won't go away.

[Verse 1]
Ticket to ride, white girl highway
Tell all the white girls they can swing my way
What up baby girl how ya doing is you single
Have you ever messed with a light skinned mandingo
And I can give damn, what all my friends say to me
You and me baby can start making up for slavery
Girl I'm just playin I got a white mom
You got any black in you (no), would you like some
O' word, you like my songs that be playin on tha radio
You know they send tears to a flattery fleratio
I ain't a pickie guy so I really don't care
I'll hit a white chick that got undron hair
Or a ghetto white chick who be trying to act black
With your name on your chain and her hair slicked back
You can be anywhere Maine down to Malibu
From a Trailer park or tha way to park avenue
See me with a black girl you not gon' comment
Or it might just been a white girl with a tan
And sista's don't get mad cause I'm out bangin white chicks
Cause we all look tha same when we turn off the light swicth
See back in the day I was getting no play
Then I went the white girl way like "OJ"
So you can call on "Kato", but I'm sorry "OJ"
Cause I got my white girl and everything is ok

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've had rich ones, poor ones, I've even had some famous ones
Like "Tracy Lawerence", "Houston", and "Jenna Jameson"
Right about now I'm on probation for three years
Cause I caught a stat case for having sex with
"Britney Spears"
Got head in her dressing room I busted on her chin
Oops (spaooooo), I did it again, "Gwenyth Paltrow"
Always saying I be making her laugh, she gave me head
Cause If I hit it I would break her in half
She ain't even the only white actress on my mattress
I even had sex with that fat chick from "The Pratice"
And "Katie Holmes" always trying to take me home
Callin me on the phone sayin, 'Casey make me moan'
Smokin weed on the jets again, on a higher plane
Hate country music wanna bang "Shania Twain"
Whether short or tall, whether blonde or brunette
I ain't met a white girl that I would'nt do yet
And I got "Alyssa Milano" hitting high notes like sopranos
When we all up in my bedroom making some 'milanoes'
I really don't think there a girl that I missed
I used to like "Mariah", till I learned she was mixed
For those who gettin furious please don't take me serious
I'm just wildin' out like "Eddie Murphy" in "Delirous"
But if you took offense and you black or you white
I glad you did sucka cause you way too up tight

[Chorus]
