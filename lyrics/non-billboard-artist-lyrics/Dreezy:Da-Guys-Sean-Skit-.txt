Bad bitch
I'm slaying all these hoes, I'm a savage
Ain't with no basic shit, I'm not your average
Feelin' like I'm Kobe, I ain't giving niggas passes
Yeah I get it but I go hustle like I ain't had shit
If I got paid to piss you bitches off I'd be mad rich
Flexing on the gram but broke in person, that's a catfish
Got her own and a crib, now that's a bad bitch

[Verse 1]
Gave mercy to these hoes, what would Jesus do?
Somebody got to take a loss, shit it was me or you
Mean mugging in the Ghost, they yellin' Beetlejuice
My niggas with me got more stripes than an Adidas suit
I took a break from all the hype to let you bitches get practice
They want me to give my seat up like I'm Angela Bassett
Probably catch me in the closet like I'm coming out
Hope bitches just as good on foot the way they run they mouth
Your man outside and what he drive was the only challenge
First date, hundred a plate, that's how I know he got it
Get you touched the first defense so niggas know we 'bout it
Trippin', have you swimmin' out on Stoney Island, this ain't no emoji battle
Numbers start doubling when they mention my name
I seen the cockiest, gift of god and as quick as they came
Somebody call the traffic guard, these niggas out of they lane
I bet these bitches gon' respect me like a pimp with a cane

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you niggas run with the hype
Your favorite bitch on Instagram don't look like that in real life
Your favorite nigga in my DM's but ain't even my type
And your favorite rapper should be acting cause she don't even write
Talk of the town, I walk around like I woke up with a crown
These bitches tryna take the sauce but they can't fuck with the sound
You always with a yes man, I keep real niggas around
Put in that work 'til we proud, we got this shit off the ground
And I'm still fine with no makeup so I'm slayin' hoes when I leave man
Second time getting top from the same nigga, call this shit a recap
Got the roof down with the seat back and a middle finger to the feedback
I heard rumors sayin' I went broke, only hating hoes will believe that
This shit mean more than a trophy
And shit you know you got that dope when bitches tryna get nosy
No matter what day of the week I'ma get high like I'm Smokey
I keep it charged like [?], don't let these bitches provoke me
