Light:Silencer
I lost myself for this but now
We march to eternity, unrivaled
I’ve chosen glory over home

We exceed the reach of ground command
The light has finally reached my eyes

This light
Revealing
It’s glorious
Above this world

Glory to the explorers
Glory to the explorers of Mars

No glory to these explorers
No glory to these explorers

I wrongly scorned her
My sorrow grows
The Bear it groans
The void, my home
