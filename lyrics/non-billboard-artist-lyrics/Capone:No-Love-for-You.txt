No-Love-for-You:Capone
Not on the right track lately, lately
I need a pick me up
I'm tired of all the same things, same things
I need to switch it up
That's when I saw her
Hair back, t-shirt, small town swag
Moves that, moves that
I swerve, you don't turn, we 'bout to crash
Moves that, moves that
Oh when I see your face I have to hit the brakes
Like I'm staring at a red light, red light
Oh girl this love can't wait, I'm ready for the chase
Let's turn a red light into a green light
Turn on the green light, oh baby we can turn on the green light'
Cause you don't have to put on your red light
Let's turn a red light into a green light
Don't stop baby, baby
We're gonna go all night
Life in the fast lane's crazy, crazy
So just enjoy the ride
And still you've got your hair back, t-shirt, small town swag
Moves that, moves that
I swerve, you don't turn, we 'bout to crash
Moves that, moves that
Oh when I see your face I have to hit the brakes
Like I'm staring at a red light, red light
Oh girl this love can't wait, I'm ready for the chase
Let's turn a red light into a green light
Turn on the green light, oh baby we can turn on the green light'
Cause you don't have to put on your red light
Let's turn a red light into a green light
Nothing but an open road
No destination, just you and me alone
Hearts go wild into the night
Give me the green light, green light
Oh when I see your face I have to hit the brakes
Like I'm staring at a red light, red light
Oh girl this love can't wait, I'm ready for the chase
Let's turn a red light into a green light
Oh when I see your face I have to hit the brakes
Like I'm staring at a red light, red light
Oh girl this love can't wait, I'm ready for the chase
Let's turn a red light into a green light
Turn on the green light, oh baby we can turn on the green light'
Cause you don't have to put on your red light
Let's turn a red light into a green light
