Surrender:Cash Cash
I was running on an empty heart
Not a trace of gasoline
Trying to dim every single spark
That could hurt, that could burn all of me
Like a soldier on the battle ground
Lying wounded on the field
I was fighting along with the broken heart
Now I'm caught in a war with no shield

If you hold me now
And leave me never
Say you'll stay, we'll be forever
Then I surrender, surrender
If you hold me now
And leave me never
Say you'll stay, we'll be forever
Then I surrender, surrender

(surrender, surrender)

I push and pull all the ones that try
Then I'll wash and fade away
As I look around the vacate room
I see nobody left here to play
Cause I made myself a prisoner
Shackle up all my fears
But I feel you're breaking away out the walls
Make them fall, make them all disappear

If you hold me now
And leave me never
Say you'll stay, we'll be forever
Then I surrender, surrender
If you hold me now
And leave me never
Say you'll stay, we'll be forever
Then I surrender, surrender

(surrender, surrender)

Hold me now
And leave me never
Say you'll stay, we'll be forever
Then I surrender, surrender

Then I surrender, surrender
