Intro:Young Rome
Young Rome
1st album
I'm here now
Yo, yea
Let me get at y'all for a second
C'mon
Let's go

Yo, I spit like no other
I let my flow smotha
Cities and burrows I'm thorough
Rich but I'm so gutta
I'm so rookie you'd think I was satins advocate
I'm bad bruh bad as JLO so call me Affleck
Sick of dis sickle cell anemia

Platinum status so I treat hoes like they the media
I keep 'em off me no replies or comments
And haters can go out the same way that Saddam went
'Cuz you cannot hide and you cannot run
And most of you niggas will die by the gun
'Cuz rap is outta control
And everybody frontin' like they heart is as cold as the North Pole

So this is why this LP was designed
To free your mind from you fakers
Be wrong if I cried
Talk about muttering locks in every soda crack rock
Young Rome says stop
Get yo mind right nigga

I'm here now
That's right
Yeah, I'm here now
I'm feelin' good niggas
I don't think y'all niggas heard me
I can't be stopped at this point
Check this

I'm here now and ain't no stopping me
And ain't no dropping me
Yo, niggas I'm here now
Fill me on this
Move out my way
It's my day today
My day today

I'm here now
TUG, ain't no stopping me
Young Rome
It's either all or nothing baby
I play dis game to win
Not to lose

Welcome
To Young Rome's life
Let's get 'em
Tech fade me out
It's time to stop playin' wit dese niggas
