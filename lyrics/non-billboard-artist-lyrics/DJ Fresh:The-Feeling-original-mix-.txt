The feeling, the feeling, the feeling
Everyone in the world it's gonna to see.
.the human being.

Such a good feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling, feeling, feeling
such a good feeling, this feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling

Living tomorrow as easy as that
if you want me further I'm not coming back
I've canceled my credit, I've switched up my phone
I'm leaving it all behind
'cause I see this vision when I close my eyes
surrounded by bright light and indigo skies
the feeling's electric as if paradise
is come to take over my mind

Ohh such a good feeling, this feeling
Ohh, I can't stop myself feeling
Ohh such a good feeling, this feeling
Ohh, I can't stop myself feeling

When the darkness pulls you under
when the water feels too deep
I will lead you to the feeling, ohh
and I will give you what you need, ohh

Ohh, the feeling, the feeling, the feeling
Everyone in the world it's gonna to see.
.the human being.

Such a good feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling, feeling, feeling
such a good feeling, this feeling, this feeling
I can't stop myself feeling

Ohh such a good feeling, this feeling
Ohh, I can't stop myself feeling
Ohh such a good feeling, this feeling
Ohh, I can't stop myself feeling

I can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
Such a good feeling, I can't stop
Such a good feeling, I can't stop
Such a good feeling, I can't stop myself feeling
I can't stop, such a good feeling
I can't stop, such a good feeling
I can't stop, such a good feeling
I can't stop, such a good feeling myself feeling
