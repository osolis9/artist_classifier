My-Brother-Taught-Me-How-to-Swim:Passion Pit
My brother taught me how to swim
We treaded water underneath the ocean's skin
And then he washed away my sins
He held me closer as the tide was coming in

But then why, what could I say?
What would it mean?
Cause then I, I'd give away
All the love I feel
Just a child, I was waiting
On the line, he elevated
He stayed put while I was wandering
Count so long he started wondering
Why, I got lost

My brother taught me how to give
He spilt his love until it stretches too thin
Oh how I wanna be like him
He takes away the weight before your heart gives in

But then why, what could I say?
What would it mean?
Cause then I, I'd give away
All the love I feel
Just a child, I was waiting
On the line, he elevated
He stayed put while I was wandering
Count so long he started wondering
Why, I got lost

If I love the way my brother loves
None of it would happen like the way that it was

But then why, what could I say?
What would it mean?
Cause then I, I'd give away
All the love I feel
Just a child, I was waiting
On the line, he elevated
He stayed put while I was wandering
Count so long he started wondering
Why, I got lost
