On-My-Knees:411
[Chorus]
I can fall down on my knees
And apologise to you
Is that it must dial

I remember how we met
It was on the train
How could I forget
You smiled and you looked at me
The soft of your lips that captured me
The whole ride down we kept our eyes on each other
And then we sat down together
You gave me your number said give me a call
I thought I wouldn't call at all
Here we are fell in love like hand to glove
Pure bliss in a bite
Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight
We never seem to get it right

[Chorus x2]
I can fall down on my knees (my knees)
And apologise to you (to you)
Is that it must dial (is that it must dial)

I remember the night we were home alone
You were on the sofa 
I was on the phone
You overheard me call out my best friends name
That's when you went crazy started going insane
Grabbed the phone from my hand
Backed me against the wall
Shouting and asking who was on the call?
You wouldn't believe me when I say it's just a friend
That's when all the matters began
(that's all)

[Chorus x2]
I can fall down on my knees (fall down on my knees)
And apologise to you (to you)
Is that it must dial

He's got you begging on your knees (and)
Crying in your sleep (and)
Making you believe him
But you're stronger than you'll ever know girl
You control your own world
No need to take no more

Don't take it no more
He's got you begging on your knees (and)
Crying in your sleep (and)
Making you believe him
But you're stronger than you'll ever know girl
You control your own world
No need to take no more

[Chorus]
I can fall down on my knees
And apologise to you
Is that it must dial
