Bet the flow will break you down

I gets so busy on the mic with my rhythmic flows
That's bound to leave you bangin' when it gets exposed
'Cause the way I could display my style is wicked
So run up to your counters and go and get your tickets

I know you got dreams of roasting me hot
But I got flavor like that candy in your grocery shop
The dramatical, craft-matical, soul fanatic
And nadic, with the crazy flow that's automatic

Flowin' like them bolts from the sky like Zeus
An old schooler, who drops mathematics like a ruler
Or protractor, you don't have no nactor
Hang with me, come with the steez and see I'm no actor

That shit is real homes, psyches, so bring your own dice
So we call roll, gonna lose, I'm takin' all your dough
Punch you in your eye and come raid your town
With the sound full of spunk as we break it down 'cause it's

Bet the flow will break you down

The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
The flow will break you down

What to do? Timbuck-one, Timbuck-two
I can't see a t'ing like Mr. Magoo
The sniveling, huh-huh-ha, c-c-c-coughing, hah-choo
Stuffy, naughty, nappy, check-a the box, dreadlox fox

So na, hic-up, na, hic-up, what's up? Tic-tic-tock, oops
Shiver me timber now boots, oh my gosh, oh my goose
Shucks, yo now I huh, huh, hah, got the hic-ups
And I rips up many tracks, jumpin' Johosafat

Don't make a sound, I see you rabbit
Tracks, like thunder and lightening
Watch the frightening, can't you tell?
I'm loco, ooh, they don't know very well, so

I lumps 'em, bruise 'em, with black eyes and stitches
They're mad, can we run from rags unto riches
Now my scruples, I lose 'em, damage, I bruise 'em
I'm two-faced kid, so call me the [Incomprehensible]

I got secrets, bo, I don't know like loco, I'm [Incomprehensible]
I'm changing, visions blurry so call me, um, Quasemoto
And yo, I'll switch up, hic-up, switch up, hic-up
Switch up, hic-up, switch-up

With or without the hic-ups, these emcess quickly pick up
Then I freak my Fu-schnick styles to the microphone
Yo, rip it and I freaks it, hic-up, freaks it, hic-up
When I freaks it with my drunken technique

I'm makin' pimps squeak but now it's whacker than
The [Incomprehensible], way up shits creek
So don't sleep, when it's time to creep, we roll my jeep
And if the shit gets kind of thick, here comes the five sticks freak
To break you down

The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

The funk makes me tipsy, got the whiskey
Yo, can this be the funkdafied horror, tomorrow I'll flip tip
See, er, the blur in my eyes rectifies
The funk freak me, so peep me, as I speak the grammar

I rocks my bandanna, shave my head clean
And on my screens than Vanna White
How should I roll when I write?
Then light the spliff, now it's time to recite

A verse, a hurse you be leavin' in
Believe me when I say what I feel, and it's real, not like TV
And science fiction, my addiction is the funk
With more fumes than a skunk, 'cause I'm bound to jump
So check the sound

Bet the flow will break you down

The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
The flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down

Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
Bet the flow will break you down
