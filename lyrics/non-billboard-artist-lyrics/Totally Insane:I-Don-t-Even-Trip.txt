I-Don-t-Even-Trip:Totally Insane
[Ad Kapone]
People always askin ad rock where her beau been
I been docked in the cuts wit my pad and my pen
Creatin gangta flows just because the gangstas know
Its been a long hard road and I had a way to go
When I was young I was labled as a basket case
And every one walked by me got the gas face
And then I started getin taller and my started gowin
And people said I looked like a Samoan
But thats all right cuz it made all the girls stare
But some wouldn't talk cuz my hair was longer than theirs
I got a curl and they tease me bout the drip drip
But I kept it banging so I didn't even trip
People always wanna talk down on the under man
But I had self respect so I kept the upper hand
And because all the girls was biting...
That's what kept kapone always fighting
Jealous punks will sweat you over spilt milk
And try to plex and that's what gets brothers killed
See I don't care about another gold on his grip
That don't phase me, man I don't even trip

[Background chorus]

I aint tripping no more it really aint worth my time
So just caution all I kick them back and wrote you all a rhyme

[Ad Kapone]
My momma always told me it was gonna be days like this
Where your name is gonna be on somebody's list
But don't drip off the perk and janx
And to the ones that was that was really down give em' thanx
Lesson 3 no don't change yours for nobody
It's funny what some people would do for money
As I was growing up I had a lot of stepping stones
Never lonely had my older brother rey bones
Back at ravens wood man them was the old days
Doing assemblies and talent shows in P. A
I remember coming up with the K.O.D
The kings of death man we was bout 12 deep
Doc Luc, Chung, Mac 10, and I.C.D
Glenny Glen, Brucy B, Spice D, and Me
Tiny t, and the E all old schoolers
When it came down to rap man we was the rulers
Then everybody moved away and i was alone
Then I realized it was up to kapone
To keep the group alive even by myself G
Then doc luc came back it came reality
Me and doc rocked shows and brought the house down
Then we made them O's and shopped them around
No one discovered us but we still rocked on
We bumped and kept all the crowds pumped
Like the talent show at Menlo and county park
I think that's what lit up my first spark
We was rocking and the scouts were recruiting
It was coo till dumb brothers started shooting
It was drama and it raised up a lot of fuss
And after all that they blamed it on us
But the media hype wont keep me down
I control that my behavior is on the crowd
I don't understand why they come with that shit
I'm only Ad man I don't even trip
