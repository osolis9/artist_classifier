Back-Up-Plan:Big Boi
Put that bitch in smash mode
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
And one and two, now you know what to do

Motherfucker let's go, yeah, yeah, let's go
Put your back into it like you grandma do it, let's go
A-Town
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan

I knew I was wrong for thinking that she cared
I knew all along, that's why I stay prepared
And one and two, now you know what to do
My nigga what was I to do but find someone else
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan

This is how it starts
Momma fell heel over head and says you was the one
Big Boi, but she calls me Antwan
So just for fun, I went along with hon

I was young, full of cum, done for the skeet skeet, not dumb
We would meet undiscretely discrete
She in heat like bitch on a leash
No disrespect, but metaphorically she's a beast

No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding 'til we got slimy
Yeah, from that sweet stick thang, can't complain
I was hooked on the box like the hot Krispy Cremes

I knew I was wrong for thinking that she cared
I knew all along, that's why I stay prepared
And one and two, now you know what to do
My nigga what was I to do but find someone else
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan

Well, it didn't take long for me to game peep
It was week after week, I was seeing the same freak
I be damned if we posing for pictures and throwing rice
Maybe throwing up in Vegas while Daddy's on the dice

I might, might just put you on the chopping block tonight, night
Act right and you can get my second string spotlight
But if you freaking, I'm speaking clean as a whistle
This'll be the last official offer before dismissal

No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding til we got slimy
Yeah, got the latex for the fit
Because she trying to trick Daddy, Slip-N-Slide on this dick

I knew I was wrong for thinking that she cared
I knew all along, that's why I stay prepared
And one and two, now you know what to do
My nigga what was I to do but find someone else
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan

You are not the one, you are not the one
You can be my two, you can be my two
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and two, now you know what to do

I knew I was wrong for thinking that she cared
I knew all along, that's why I stay prepared
And one and two, now you know what to do
My nigga what was I to do but find someone else
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan

And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
Now two, now two, I'ma give her back to you
I'm through, nigga
I done had enough of the nast stuff
One, two, yeah
