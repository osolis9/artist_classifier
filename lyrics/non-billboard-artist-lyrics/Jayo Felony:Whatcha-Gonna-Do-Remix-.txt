Whatcha-Gonna-Do-Remix-:Jayo Felony
Def Jam, what?
The remix, yeah
Come along
What, what?

I said, "I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but what, but what, what, what?

I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
When I'm in Daygo, I'm bumpin' my music
With my dog and dogettes we loop loop
Me and lil' Trook like book and Luke duke

Now come see me get me Lex coupe
'Cuz this song'll be bigger than there it is Whoop Whoop
Whatcha gon do with it baby when I give you some?
Wha-wha-what what what? Hit him in the gut
If you don't know the scoop then keep your mouth shut

Flow what? Flow 'cause I got flow
See me walkin' on the moon by 2004
Party with the OG's spaceships and gold D's
If they don't make no songs like these, plow, plow
'Cuz it's my style when I flex, go next, flow next

I said, "I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but wha-what? Wha-what?

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low rider
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low rider

Yo, place your order for slaughter
You got balls to walk up, you leave on the walker
You oughta be hittin' more tracks than Nauta
My little friend barks like Roof, that's why I brought her

Brooklyneese, head cheese and charge
When you see me, cock it back, squeeze it hard
Or I scare the shit out you, bring the bitch out ya
Xstort your rhyme until you're puttin' your house up

Niggas in the hood no doubt could blow the trial
I'm so cool I be shoppin' in the frozen aisle
Gimme that mic, you don't got no wheels
Look through the periscope, that locked you in

Started bustin' like the white boy in higher learning
Stick you up more than hair when you put perm in
Die, be a kleptomaniac in disguise
I even take eyes outta seven thirty fives

Dub, Mack 10, wha-what? Wha-what? What?
I'm 'bout to tear a chicken head gu-gut, gu-gut, gut

I said, "I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but what, but what, what, what?

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low rider
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low rider

Jayo say, "What, what? I say, "Whoop, whoop"
Bangin' through the wood in the 84 coupe
When it come to gangsta raps, you know, Mack got 'em
Still saggin' in khakis with the cuff on the bottom

Hip hop or yayo, you don't roll like 1-0
Twenty chrome on the Benz, thirteen gold on the four
From the way I twist my fingers, you know, I'm from
So much ice on my wrist that my hand feels numb

I start flippin' off sherm or the green that be stickin'
Though I rock the microphone, I can still sell a chicken
Hoo bangin' affiliates from the W S C
Mack 10, Young G with the Recipe

Hit 'em again, hit 'em again
Who's the triple braided beard, baby?
Hustla when it comes to my gram
WC, clatter for chatter clearin' the section
Bangin' a bandana, slangin' the westside connection

Testin', microphone checkin', check out my melons
Smashin' misdemeanors, mashin' with Jayo Felony
Steadily, chasin' them ends, wreckin' the mirrors slow
Loc, I'm too sexy for my fuckin' Benzo

I said, "I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do?
I could give it to you but whatcha gonna do with it?
I could give it to you but what, but what, what, what?

I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low rider
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' hood, hood
I'm too sexy for my motherfuckin' low rider
