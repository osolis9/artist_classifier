Breath-Control-II:Boogie Down Productions
Hah, giddyap, ha ha ha hah
Another dope, dope, dope style by the massive B D P crew
Of course, I will now present to you a different view
The 1990 of course, '89 is behind me, so check it out

It's called breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, breath control a-lone
Breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone

It's K R S One, yes the t'cha
I wear Clarks and only Nike sneaker
In your speaker is the new style
Dedicated to the intelligent child

In the front row or behind me
We're gonna pull somebody file for the 90's
You want lyrics? We come correct
B D P, only movin' with respect

The other MC's, they can't believe me
A when I rhyme it sound just like a CD
We don't lip-sync, we go all live
On stage, I bring about four or five

That's D-Nice, Sydney, and Melodie
And myself, Harmony and Willie D
We come humble, we just grumble
While other MC's crew just crumble

They want dancers, they want lighting
They want effects to make them look exciting
But it's frightening 'cause without that
The whole crew, is whick, whick, whick whack

B D P comes with the cheapest
And perform miracles like Jesus
The total respect, we achieve it
And the big head-liner can't believe it

It's called breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, breath control a-lone
Breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, get ready for the break

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hah, well the styles I usually dish out
Are so dope that you don't wanna miss out
We got pages of the dope stuff
So in the record store you can't pass by us

Get the album, hear the music
And hold on so you just don't lose it
As a reference for any MC
That wanna test, K R S, O N E

'Cause I've been watchin', these other rap groups
They walk around like they're some kinda big soup
You can't touch them, you only see them
In a arena or big coliseum

So when you watch them for a second
Them sound nothin' like they do on record
Them sound cheesy, them sound wheezy
For twenty dollars boy you know them never please me

So I see this and prevent this
It's like goin' for a checkup at the dentist
'Cause when you come to a B D P performance
The microphone had better have endurance
'Cause we'll check it and then wreck it
And then the sound man has got to accept it

Because it's breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, breath control a-lone
Breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, take it out
