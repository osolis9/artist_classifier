Down south is where I stay
Switch 4 lanes
Let My Nuts Hang
From the Antwon to the MLK
These H-Town boys like to swang and bang

(Slim Thug)
Now welcome to the city of game, piece and chains that swang
Pop trunk and bang as I grip wood grain
I'm bout that down-south city, where they show no pity
Candy paint be lookin' pretty, makin' haters feel shity
See I'mma long star balla, and a chop chop crawler
18-year-old shot calla, and a droptop crawler
I'm no less den da best, yes I must confess
And hell that sets in my chest torelive off stress
Freshly dressed in my Guess, I gotthat baguettes on my chest
It's 3rd coast in dadoor all the rest must wreck
Went from'a BMX to a GS Lex, born and raised in Houston Tex
Where we don't bar no plex
NOW .

Down South . you know we real baby
Even if we ride a Hodo or a foreign made Mercedes
Rocks in my wrist, gat close to hip
Just in case a hater out there gets me pissed
Man I'm so real, man I'm so trill
'99 I'm tryin' to get the million dollar deal
Like C-Note I'm tryin' to have diamonds in my grill
And I'm breakin' boys off with my freestyle skills
Givin' them something they can feel, man just chill
Man what the deal with the syrup and the pill
In the lac wit cat with 18's in da trunk
Da Alpine thump, it's SCREW that we bump
TV in steering wheel, with fifth wheel in the back
Went to town I keep it hot with five plates up in da dash
Wearin' white socks and dem black Nike sandals
We down-south nigga's this something yall can't handle
Ride man I'm drippin' so much up on da freeway
Down-south baby switchin' lanes up on da freeway
Wouldn't give a good-goddamn about the he say, she say
Cause when u down talk me you saw me you be sayin', "Damn he paid!"

Here I come, Here I come, I know you see me comin'
Drop my back on Antoine, pick it up on the front end
Steady hummin' I be stuntin' like a bag of diamonds
I be shinin' I be grindin' man wood on the vinyl
I'm a minor, wood on the vinyl
Broke dem boys off cause Yungstar still a finer
Houston's finest artist, I'm da smartest, boys get rigormortis
I'm crawlin' real slow on 4's like a tortoise, like a toad
I'm in da mode, finna explode, hoppin' out my rides do's
Got the Kenneth Cole on my toes, I'm so throwed
I'm complete, unique from my feet from my head to my feet, something sweet

Got eleven Chevy's, I'm the rhymin' acrobatic
Your boy he da baddest, naw I'm da maddest
I done slipped, I done slided, house don got wider
Broke dem boys off now I'm a wood provider
I'm in Asia, slidin' on my datons
Bounce, rock and skate, got Nintendo and a Station
Maybe Super Sega, rock like Omega
Messin' with these boys I be ridin' with a Vega
Comin' with a woman, real clear, all up in their ear
Baggets and Pioneer, once a year
I'm bout dat Belvedere, I'm a butler, I done reached, Idone cut ya'
Break des boys off with baggets and clusters
Round my neck, if you disrespect grab my Teck
And leave you wet on the set I don't expect
Won't be da Gama I'm mo shake den??
Moved to Alabama, and got silk pajamas
Got silk sandals, I ride sled I turn their heads
Boys get scared u better call on da FED's
I rock u don't stop got Gucci shoes and socks
Sowed up da block, like da Pac I won't stop
We dangerous, dismantle, wood upon da panel
Nike shoes, Nike sandals, light my girl with a candle, handle
Knock on do's, do's done get froze
As I pull out da wide body candy red low (low low low)
Watch I roll red maybe roll blue or green I'm on the scene
Diamond ring Byzantine, I'mma swang I'm a swanger
Watchin' Cliffhanger, screens fall I'mma ball
Better get the?? chamber
In the deck u come wreck, give me my tape deck
Slide I'mma ride, vibe in the special effect
Diamonds bling bling, swang and I swing
Matchin' pinky ring, Antwon to the King
Here I come here I come, yeah this Yungstar comin'
Real with da woman, hear da bang think its thunder
Naw it ain't thurder it's just me, see da candy jet ski
Read da lights its TYP, Throwed Yung Playa
I'm da mayor of the Himalayas
My diamonds glare, wide body valeter
Here he come here he .
Mann bring it back I'm ready I'm ready
