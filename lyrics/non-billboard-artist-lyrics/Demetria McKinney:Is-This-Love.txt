Is-This-Love:Demetria McKinney
It used to be easy for me to love now it seems our love just ain't enough I've given everything I've can what else do you want from me.
I keep going back and forth and then around every other day we go back up and down and I can't take it anymore wondering what I'm in this for what is this baby.
Is this Love?
Is this what love is supposed to be, I need you tell me?
I'm curious to know exactly what the definition cause baby I've got it all broken and there's something I'm missing...
Is this Love?
Oh, at times I feel like it's just only me who wants to make it work so we can be the way we were right from the start if I spended a day apart I wish we could get it back
Cause nothing is supported like before and this emptiness is growing more and more it's like I'm in this thing and it seems like no one else is inside these walls

Is this how love is supposed to be?
Is this love? I need you tell me
I'm curious to know exactly what the definition cause baby I've got it all broken and there's something I'm missing...

Don't you see me trying, I'm really really trying, don't you see me dying I'm really really dying. Tell me what do I do to get through to you to touch your heart again, start all over again.
What do I say, to get it the way?
