Hellboy baby I stand out
Go to hell, boy, bitch I got bands now
I'm about to throw it all away just to see you today
I tat your name on my face
Love me baby, its okay
You don't love me you in love with the gold chains
Fuck me baby its okay
All I do is young bitches and cocaine
Shined up baby its no shame
Watch yo bitch throw it back while you throwing shade
Lined up lookin like Cobain
Drugs drippin off of my nose ring
Lil peep bitch I'm a no name
But its a lot of shit that I don't say
Like I been on my hustle the whole way
I ain't never quitting, there's no way
I know you see me making my own lane
Hellboy, I'm killing the whole game
