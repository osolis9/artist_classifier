Buried:Cyne
Eye sore,
all alone again.
Trace the lines face of an old friend.
Your cold feet,
I tried to keep the warmth, but you wore me out again.

Take my life,
take my life,
and bury me alive.

You've lost interest in me,
I'm just words on a screen.
Before I leave I want to know that you still hate me.
You've lost interest in me,
I am the dirt beneath your feet.
My smile buried, digging deeper
A bitter ending.

Time worn, I'm left a mess,
Your smile is one that I can't forget.
I'll stand straight
You keep me in check.
Drag myself through the rust again.
I'm spread so thin
And my legs are giving way.
It's hard to fight these demons when they haunt me everyday

I plead for relief
I plead for anything

I plead for relief
I plead for anything

You've lost interest in me,
I'm just words on a screen.
Before I leave I want to know that you still hate me.
You've lost interest in me,
I am the dirt beneath your feet.
My smile buried, digging deeper
A bitter ending.

And as I guessed, you're just like the rest
Leading me into a grave of melancholy,
Self-reflection and distress.
But you, you are the tide
You are what lingers in my mind,
And I, I can't get over this,
I tried.
