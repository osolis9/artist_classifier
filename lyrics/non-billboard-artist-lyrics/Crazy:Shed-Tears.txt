Shed-Tears:Crazy
[Stress]
This is Stress reporting live from New Orleans.
Now in breaking news, 
the world is still in shock over the shooting of Tupac Shakur
who died six days after being shot.
And it was yet, another shocker, six months later,
When a bullet claimed the life of rapper Notorious B.I.G.
The rap world is in shock, wondering, what will happen next.

[Chorus: ????]

I Shed Tears for the World
I Shed Tears for the World

[First Verse: Crazy]

Father please send a sign now, I can barely breath,
Is it jealousy? Mixed with alcohol and weed?
Hopin' Daddy didn't curse me, when he dropped the seed,
See this white man's drugs, is the black man's greed,
Dear Lord I shed tears, for the whole wide World,
So many people died of AIDS or either hooked on furl,
What I would give to see my Uncle Rodney, for one last time,
Niggas beatin' charges in the feds cuz they droppin' dimes,
I keep my mind on my music and my jingles,
The store's closed and I'm broke, I'm rollin' singles,
Mingle with the women, if I could,
Undercovers in the 'Ville tryin' to, bust my hood,
Daily, I keep my Nikes on, ready for static,
They keep talkin' revolution, I been had my automatic,
And the President screamin' war, 
when the world is full of starvin' kids,
Just to keep his sex life hid,
I shed tears

[Chorus x2]

[Second Verse: Crazy]

People worried about tomorrow, me I'm livin' for today,
Tryin' to make a way, pay the rent where I stay,
Ain't nothin' comes for free playas, you best to learn that,
Specially this fire weed, so let me burn that,
Every black leader we had, is in the coffin,
You wonder why, we don't run for President more often,
Medgar Evers wasn't scared, to lead and do his thing,
That's why I love, Malcolm X and Doctor King,
And let 'em reign, our voices, speakin' for us all,
Hate crucified them, but their words'll never fall,
They got us lookin' up to mob figures as our heroes,
Compared to the Black panthers, them fools zeroes,
Alex Haley took us back, to where our roots begin,
Thou shalt not kill, that's our peoples biggest sin,
Black women stop havin' abortion, cuz that's all we got,
Wait for you to die just to take your spot,
I shed tears

[Chorus x2]

[Third Verse: Crazy]

The white cops are on the streets again, tryin' to protect me
(Why don't you niggers go back to Africa?)
Can you direct me?
I might just get lost God, cuz it's a long trip,
I put the Hennessey to my lip, and take a sip,
My Momma's mad cuz I got gold teeth,
I try to tell her when you got cash it's so sweet,
When you can pay your bills 
and take a thousand dollars worth of jail calls 
from your wife,
And still screamin' it's my life,
Shit's been hectic, since I signed with HardHead back in '94,
Took me just to leave just to see some dough,
Me and my nigga Henry stay beefin',
But even brothers fight,
So let's make a mil fool and keep it tight,
Cuz I love our farer, we got diamonds in the rough,
Our shit's like indo, hit the streets niggas and take a puff,
Even now I'm in my project, watchin' quarters hurl,
God forgive me cuz I'm broke, I shed tears for the World

[Chorus x2]

[Crazy]
Man y'all must've lost your mind or somethin
I'm sittin here readin about how you motherfuckin white folks 
done burnt down the rainforest, know what I'm sayin? 
Bad enough you motherfuckers put drugs in our communities and shit,
turnin all our peoples into dopefiends
NOW you motherfuckers tryin to suffocate us, you know what I'm sayin?
Bad enough y'all fucked up the O-Zone layer
Y'all put rockets in the sky and fucked the O-Zone layer up
If God wanted you white motherfuckers to fly,
he'd give you bitches wings, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm gettin sick of all this shit y'all doin, you know what I'm sayin?
Y'all got us fucked up man
Motherfuckers talkin' bout war, what we gonna die for this time?
Last time our Afro-Americans went over there 
on the front line in Vietnam, we died of a plastic
What we gonna die for this time? Earl? Hanh?
We gonna die for Earl? For you motherfuckers? 
We gonna go get killed for some motherfuckin earl,
and get on the motherfuckin wall
That's what they gon' put us on? A wall?
Talkin' about we died for our motherfuckin country?
Ignorance is you motherfuckers worst enemy, you know what I'm sayin?
But you don't know no better, so I shed tears for you
Every night I get on my knees and I pray,
for the whole world, that everything change, you know what I'm sayin?
I know God'll be here in no time 
to get his people, you know what I'm sayin? 
Believe me I shed tears for the world, for you

[Chorus x2]
