All-I-Need:Ricky Blaze
My name is Ricky Blaze!
When good girls go bad, you cant tell when its coming
By the way shes moving her waist line, shes up to something
Shes giving me all she got, but Im giving her the all me, all me
I just want a lap dance!

When youre moving like that, girl
When youre moving like that, girl
I want you all night, girl,
I want you all night, girl,
I want you all night, baby!

Can you stay here?
Leave me, leave me tonight
Can you stay here?
Leave me, leave me tonight

All I need is you, all I need is you
All I need is you, all I need is you
Girl, come on, come on, come out
Girl, come on, come on, comes loose, girl!

When youre moving like that, girl
When youre moving like that, girl
I want you all night, girl,
I want you all night, girl,
I want you all night, baby!

All I need is you, all I need is you
All I need is you, all I need is you
Girl, come on, come on, come out
Girl, come on, come on, comes loose, girl!
