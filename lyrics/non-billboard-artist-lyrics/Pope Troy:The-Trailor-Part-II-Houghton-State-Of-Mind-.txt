The-Trailor-Part-II-Houghton-State-Of-Mind-:Pope Troy
[Verse 1: Pope Troy]

I'm cruising through the city over-time
And this marijuana drifting see you on
The other side...(alright!)
Bye-bye and that's like saying good night
This is my Houghton state of mind
Never mind if you can't read
Between the lines
Have another line and take
You're fucking time and hope and fucking pray
That Jesus Christ might save your life
And if Satan is alive he's a prick and he won't
Get my soul I pray he resurrects so I can turn
He's body cold

[Bridge]

[ Verse 2: Pope Troy]

Nigga get you're money from your Louie Bag
Call all you're nigga's pray it make a difference
I'm going hostile...
Nigga take cover from a good distance
I'll run you over like you should of missed it
You niggas had all the game time...the fame time
All that pathetic coming late time
Embrace I cause i respect time
And this time I'm cracking the whip
In you're face bitch like a racist
