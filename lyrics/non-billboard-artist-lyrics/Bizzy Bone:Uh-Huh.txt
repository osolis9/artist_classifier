Uh huh (Uh huh) uh huh (Uh huh) Ain't nothin' like money and a ziplock bag/ Uh huh (Uh huh) uh huh (That's right) Smash for the cash yeah

-Bizzy Bone-
I don't give a (Cenz.) if you from Cali, you don't want to see me in a deep dark alley/ And I roll where the hood roll, ya know? Kill a (Cenz.) we burn the clothes and get at it/ Drunker than a... lit 'em up, split 'em up/ Seen 'em in the club and we get 'em with the big (Cenz.), big enough for the wig split, big weed and big chips/ Mo' nuts, mo' guns, mo' heart, no love for them sharks, momma/ Hit 'em with the minimac and it's like that/ Tell 'em "Bring on the drama, drama" Said it's all about the karma, I don't know/ Or maybe, if you digged inside you'd find a reminder fo' you lie... times is tough/ Put 'em up and if you're rough enough say "I don't give a (Cenz.)!" hey... "I don't give a (Cenz.)!"/ Come a long, long way and it'll be a day when we all are gone/ Send along the way some mo' heat, sendin' in his casin' this hation beneath me; My life is hard/ Said my mom was passin' me two heats and the Book of Psalms... Said my mom was passin' me two heats and the Book of Psalms...

-Chorus-

-Joker-
Take a look at my life and it ain't no turnin' back from all these snakes and thieves that got tricks up they sleeves/ They wanna put my money to a freeze or are infatuated with G's trick please (Cenz.) stratch the surface/ We bustin' straight throught he gates, single file formation, platinum 38's/ It' at least one place to hide out in all 50 states/ The life, the money, the cars, the ziplocked bags full of hash the smoke that we bag/ We smash for the cash while I mash on the gas cuz time's so short that you gotta move fast/ Suicide ain't the way so I pray everyday (Everyday) to relieve from the ignorance of beliguerence for experimenting with so many stimulants/ Cold, dark and lonely, livin with hope, I hear voices sometimes/ And when I don't know where to start I let these drugs write my rhymes/ I wanna get out the game but I can't and I don't, I wanna change my life but I know I really won't/ Everyday I wake up stuck with knives to my throat, without a lifejacket tryin' to stay afloat

-Chorus-

-Joker-
Can't tell my friends from foes cuz everybody knows about to blow so I gotta lay low/ Cop a sack of hydro, doja kinda wet so I burn slow/ Window kinda foggy so I crackt he window/ I got mouths to feed, bills to pay, my car broke down, I'm in it but instead of dealin' with my priorities I just buy a bag of/ And when I close my eyes I wish I could wake up in a whole different place but it's back to where I left off before, and with reality I'm faced/ Now my dreams are comin' true but I never gave up, this whole world owes me; You better pay up/ Like front-wheel-drive in the winter, you stuck/ I drink hard liquor that'll eat through the cup/ Now we'll smoke till we can't smoke, choke till we can't choke/ Get ahold of some of them trees baby and now, I'm smokin with Bizzy Bone and he's got my eyes lazy/ And we gon' keep rollin' untill the wheels fall off, and we gon' keep on chockin' until we cough

-Chorus-
