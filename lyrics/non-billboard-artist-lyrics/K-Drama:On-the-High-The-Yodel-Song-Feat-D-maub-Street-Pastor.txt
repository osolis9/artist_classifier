On-the-High-The-Yodel-Song-Feat-D-maub-Street-Pastor:K-Drama
Round and round and round we go
Always tryin to sing these songs
Jesus Christ is in control (whoah)
Let it bang, let it blow
Let it shine, let it glow
Everybodys gotta know (whoah)
yall keep it on the low
we keep it on the high
yall keep it on the low
we keep it on the high
yall keep it on the low
we keep it on the high
yall keep it on the low
we keep it on the high
We keep Him on the high
Yall keep Him on the low
Like Peter and Guisenemy
do you know Jesus know
we keep Him on this plain
We want our folk to know
the one who runs this show
we lie like rock and roll
they smoke crack rock and they roll blunts
they dont blare Jesus music when they rollin
They be at church sayin that they chose Him
but they all full of dung like a colon
cause they're ashamed to rep his name
cause they dont want their peers to think their lame
or think their strange so
they keep it on the down-low like R-Kelly
but I gotta rep Him cause he never fail me
had mercy when He coulda nailed me
cause I found my fresh when they tried to sell me
short time persons that would derail me
and leave me devestated when they had a party
woulda never made a terminator
now I'm a germinator man of God
His love I can't contain
you know I let it bang
and like 116
you know I'm unashamed
so no need to explain
Jesus I rep the name
and if you unashamed
lets rep Him man (ay)
Round and round and round we go
Always tryin to sing these songs
Jesus Christ is in control (whoah)
Let it bang, let it blow
Let it shine, let it glow
Everybodys gotta know (whoah)
yall keep it on the low

now my life like show and tell
you can even ask K-Drama momma
to represent the King I'm fast
but your paws like a comma momma
the life we live we give as a sacrifice
ain't no game ame ame ame
everything we do we stay true
when it's all about His name ame ame ame
Jesus don't need us
but He believe in us
enough to free us
now in He we trust
so He just get up out the way so you won't see us
let the Holy Spirit lead us
intrigue us to teach us
indeed we must
be in tune to consume when He feed us
So people say the word when they try to read us
So we lust after no thing
that's nothing anything nada
Cause I don't wanna be the one to try to defence
them scales go teeta-totta (uh-uh)
everywhere I go I shine my light
keepin it bright
my relationship with God is tight
so you me can help you get right
to offer you freedom that's gotta be a top priority (i ee)
lethargic isn't something I can afford to be (i ee)
no matta what yall say i'm gon claim
I'm victorious in His name
know that about it I'm not ashamed
keep it on the high
Round and round and round we go
Always tryin to sing these songs
Jesus Christ is in control (whoah)
Let it bang, let it blow
Let it shine, let it glow
Everybodys gotta know (whoah)

na-na-na-now, sing clear
If you need to bow down, my God appear
In the middle of the crowd, show no fear
I wrote this here, with a side of a lear
check, yep I lift Him high
pass him on the street boy that'ld be aight
but I am His therefore I die
I'm a dead man talkin' and moon walkin' in the sky
they said "shut-up" and I said "make me"
the boy fire proof "so they can't bake me"
the girl that in the word "earthquake can't shake me"
you can find me in the middle with a block
in the middle with a flock
with fiddle and a with a pop
with little with a sock
when i hit 'em with a rock
gimme two hands up
in the middle of a clock
yup, that means noon
the sky gon crack
and that'ld be soon
I gotta reach Christ all over this room
and even in the trap where it make that boom
and now that red bandanna in the air
now me I'mma blush they ain't barely in the air
cause then I'mma share
to the share on the air
if He say go, then I say where (where)
and I don't care 'bout who they are
cause my flow flow so like CPR
tryna save a life like the ER
sling shot these words so so far
I beat my chest scream out like Tarzan
Mic in my hand so I am an
close to the sun but got no tan
my mic's His way to fortune
