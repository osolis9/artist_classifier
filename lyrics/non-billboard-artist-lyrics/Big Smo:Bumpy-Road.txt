Bumpy-Road:Big Smo
hop on in baby girl lets go
Slide on over then hold me close
climb on top cuz we about to roll
down a
bum bum bumby road
Got the music cranked up and the beat down low
sittin real high and riding real slow
sippin and smokin with your boy Big Smo
Down a
Bum Bum Bumpy Road
oh yeah
That sweet summer night
the skies wide open and the moods just right
My Chevy sittin tall covered in mud
And im thinkin bout you and a six pack of suds
on an old back road where the blacktop ends
Dont tweet this girl it aint for your friends
Now ride around the corner where the creek bed ends
it gets a little bumpy no time to buckle in
hold on tight hell slide a little closer
Your rollin with a big boss girl climb over
let the bum bum bumps just jiggle your guts
Now drop it on me baby while i steer through these ruts
hop on in baby girl lets go
Slide on over then hold me close
climb on top cuz we about to roll
down a
bum bum bumby road
Got the music cranked up and the beat down low
sittin real high and riding real slow
sippin and smokin with your boy Big Smo
Down a
Bum Bum Bumpy Road
Hell im as country as cornbread potatoes and ...
wild as a billy goat slick as a Bullfrog buck as a whitetail ripping in trails
Smashing in my side by side
Raisin' Hell
pickin chickens and the women that are ready to go
You know the mudbog mamas that are willing to
