We work from hand to hand, from country to town
From city to state, from world to world, nigga
From universe to universe

The chamber of this banger is 36th chamber
Understand equality slang
That of Allah's name
Played the rabbit, like you dead
Mork from Ork, first take support
See me in the source
Yo I take the eighty-five percent brain
'Cause black makes, what makes rain
Dirty brain is like payday to me
God, unique baby

Who's the five percent of the planet earth?
Tell 'em Poppa Wu
Well it sure ain't Poppa Smurf
Got to check your blood
Take you to church
Ministers down with the nerds
Ever since birth
White man always tryin' to take
The black man's turf
Black man built America
I named ya after Asia, you ain't my momma
Now her name is Erika Bo Derekah

What, you like that slave name?
It wasn't supposed to sound better
New rule order, new rule order
For all the maniacs in jail
Read this letter
Be behind me, when I'm makin' this cheddar
'Cause I'ma make it more better, for our babies
'Cause they play in the same schoolyards everyday
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

You've got that white white white white
White man clock on your wall
I'm tired of gettin' up goin' to work
For that white white white white man y'all
I's got a bad boss
These thoughts was fuckin' Diana Ross
I ain't no echo easy, makin' this money
Nuh! show yourself

Whitey come on, get the money
My father Allah walk with Gods
Just like the dollar bill
Walk with God we trust
And I walk this dog
Two-thousand, two-hundred miles for you
Let the folks here know, it's done
Hey blackie, yo whitey

It's all, all, all in together now
We gettin' paid, gettin' dressed for the weather now
All, all, all in together now
We gettin' paid, gettin' dressed for the weather now
All, all in together now
Gettin' paid, gettin' dressed for the weather now
All in together now
We're gettin' paid, gettin' dressed for the weather now
Peace

It's all in together now
New world order baby, y'know what I'm sayin'?
Y'all recognize it's together
You understand me? It's the Dirt Dog speakin'
My word is bond, and my bond is life
It's all in together now my niggaz, and my niggarettes
My people's, don't worry about it
It's all slang from the same gang
I'm black out, and I'm black in
I'm white out, and I'm white in
So what?
