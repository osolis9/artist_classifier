Morning-Star:LaLa
Open your eyes now
tell me what do you see
and look around now
all this beauty is free,.

Even when
the world start shaking,.
Hold my hand and i'll be next to u
Right here–

Here and now,
I dont wanna be
this lil girl trapped in a box (no more)

Here and now
I wanna be,,
all the things that shines among the stars…….
Hmmm….

Tell me a secret,,
i'll keep it locked in my heart
Let's run away now,,
you'll be my morning star,.

Someday,,
you'll know.
in "LOVE" it shows
Just feel it glow.
C'mon let's go!
