Love-Of-Life:K-Rino
[** feat. David Sha:]


[David Sha:]
Love, love-love, love-love, love-love*

[K-Rino:]
The initial meeting was magic, my vision was real pleased*
I met her on the pasta isle near the macaroni and cheese
Despite a dose of intimidation I moved closer
Her glow was so ultra, I was nervous to approach her
Was kind out of practice, hadn't done this in a while
But much to my astonishment, I was greeted with a smile
I told her my name is K-Rino, she cut me off flat
She said "What's your real name? Your mama didn't name you that"
As we chopped it up for a few, the similarities grew
I'm looking in the basket, "Oh are you a vegetarian too?"
I know you in here making groceries and I ain't tryna stall you
So, I'm getta out ya way but is it alright if I call you?
She said "Sure", now I'm home tryna keep my cool
Killing time tryna to use the old school two day rule
When I finally picked the phone up, butterfly start to visit
I get an apprehensive feeling as I start dialing the digits
All kind of thoughts enter my mental, I start to wonder
Is this just a voicemail? Did she give me the wrong number?
I'm assuming in a few short seconds I will know
The doubt turned into elation once I heard her say "Hello?"

(Chorus) David Sha
Love is life
And the life of love
Through the bad and good
It's so beautiful
And even when it all fades away
You can live to love
Another day, another day

[K-Rino]
As we embarked upon our first real verbal endeavor
Conversation flowed like I had been knowing her forever
We was so compatible it was laughable
The connection and energy from that natural attraction was unmatchable
The vibe she gave off was so casual
She was laid back smart and rational
Passionate not theatrical
The progression through courtship was gradual
The way she seem to travel through my every mental avenue was masterful
Three hours of phone talking nightly
In subsequent daily, text messages and emails she would write me
You know that feeling that gets in your stomach when...
Every thought that's coming from within that special someone is accomplishing
The consummation date I'm wondering
No sex or fondling or astonishing
I can't believe how many months its been
Patiently I've waited, the duration was completed
On the day that we released it expectation was exceeded

(Chorus) David Sha

[K-Rino]
Sharing home, now we entering the inseparable zone
And we so gon' that friends and family done left us alone
A minor discrepancy never was long
Respect made nothing irreparable, correctional efforts was strong
But things started gon' terribly wrong
We lost stride, love started giving way to mistrust from both sides
Animosity and lack of communication starts
Went from fiending to be together to fiending to be apart
Now attention and resentment the both of us are consumed
Gon' hours without speaking but sitting in the same room
And the same bed, but now it's like a wall is between us
Folks who knew us then wouldn't recognize us if they seen us
As the frustration levels reached a peak in escalation
The agitation graduates to daily altercation
We was both hurting, problems you can read in my face
I started feeling like Tom because I needed MySpace
See at first we was the perfect lovers
We went from speaking encouraging words to seeking out verbal slurs to hurt each other
And truthfully it's not worth it brother
I use to see deep in her other realm but now I only see the surface of her
You feel the burn, ask yourself when will you learn
Your real concern as she starts telling you that old familiar term
Yeah I love you but I'm not in love with you
In retrospect, no regrets it's for the best to break up this official

(Chorus) David Sha

[David Sha]
Love, love-love, love-love, love-love
