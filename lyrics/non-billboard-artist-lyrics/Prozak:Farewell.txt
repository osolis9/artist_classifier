Farewell:Prozak
Verse 1
I think you did it this time I think she's leaving you It seems she is finally fed up you better man up and speak the truth I know your only human but that's no excuse for consuming and taking advantage pursuing her value to ruins it sorta hurts to finally find that your separating I'm praying you make it cause the results could be devastating you guys deserve to be together not to leave each other you need to better the weather and keep this storm from going under so many years invested she always kept you protected peep her perspective she's only asking to be respected I'm only saying this because I feel it sincerely and I care about the both of you equally I'm just hoping that you can here me

Chorus X2
Think about all the chances you had
mistreating her and making her sad
devastating her and treating her bad
she gave you everything you needed everything she has

Verse 2
you say you love her but your still abusing her your actions speak louder then words only confusing her what does it take from you to reinstate the faith and prove you are forsaken before she finally takes herself away from you you'll lose the best and only thing you have can you go on without her i don't think you can she'll send you back to nothing right from where you came attack you to save herself but that's the only plan and some say there is no fury like a woman scorn when betrayed by the loved ones she's been caring for perhaps one day you will understand her more it's not to late she's feeling fed up right now down to her core..can't take no more.
