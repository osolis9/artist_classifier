Waiting-Here-for-You-:Charizma
It was a day like any other day
No one would ever know why you left
Trying to be everything to everyone
This time you're all alone
With your fears

Losing sight of purpose
Wanting to be true
Forgetting how much I really love you

All through the day, all through the night
I'm gonna be right by your side
When you let go, I'll take control
I will be waiting here for you
You will see a better day
I gave my life to make a way
I will be waiting here for you
I will be waiting

Every now and then you hear my voice inside
Calling you to come home
Can't you see?
A father's arms are strong enough to carry you
Carry you through the doubts
When you're weak

Leaving the shadows
Falling to your knees
Rising once again to be free
One day I know you'll see
One day you will be free
One day you will be free
