Right-Behind-You:Ethic
Oooooo...
(You got it, you got it girl)
Oooooo...

Girl you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy
To be in love and to give you
This heart of mine

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together baby
We could be alright
How can this be wrong
When it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, I
And I'll never let you go...

You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call of me
I'm right there
Right there

'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

Give me butterflies, just thinking
About you girl you're on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together baby
We could be alright
How can this be wrong
When it feels so right?
Yeah I really love you
I really love you, I
And I'll never let you go...

You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call of me
I'm right there
Right there

'Cause you listen and you care
It's so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

Baby baby...
oooo oooo...

You should now
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call of me
I'm right there
Right there

'Cause you listen and you care
It's so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

You should know that yeah...
I'm never gonna change girl
I'm always gonna stay girl.
