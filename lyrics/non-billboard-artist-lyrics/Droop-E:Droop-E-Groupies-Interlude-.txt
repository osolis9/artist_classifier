Droop-E-Groupies-Interlude-:Droop-E
As I take my step to the way of life
I feel my hands gripped tight by the Hands of Death
I tried so hard to free myself
Hope I have none but a heart full of DOUBT
Till I hear this voice from above

As I take my step to the way of life
I feel my hands gripped tight by the Hands of Death
I tried so hard to free myself
Hope I have none but a heart full of DOUBT
Till I hear this voice from above

Drop Doubt cos He died like a man
Drop Doubt cos He rose again
Drop Doubt cos He died like a man
Drop Doubt cos He rose again
His resurrection casts us out from Fear and Death

Time and time again you see the FIRE in this side
You gotta live it up
Drop Doubt
Time and time again you see the FIRE in this side
You gotta live it up
I said Drop Doubt
Drop Doubt
Drop Doubt

As I take my step to the way of life
I feel my hands gripped tight by the Hands of Death
I tried so hard to free myself
Hope I have none but a heart full of DOUBT
Till I hear this voice from above

Drop Doubt cos He died like a man
Drop Doubt cos He rose again
Drop Doubt cos He died like a man
Drop Doubt cos He rose again
His resurrection casts us out from Fear and Death
