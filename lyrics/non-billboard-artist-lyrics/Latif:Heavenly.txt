Heavenly:Latif
Ooh, yeah
Come on to the dance floor with me
Walk me to the dance floor
Come out to the dance floor, yeah

Girl right now, now where I wanna be
Not at the club [Incomprehensible]
I gotta come home, got a taste for some sweet
When it comes to makin' love you got the recipe

You sprinkle little this and a little bit of that
You got the kinda love that makes a brother come back
So throw your cares to the wind, baby
'Cuz tonight is your night, oh baby

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do
Well, well, well

Shh
Come on to the dance floor with me
Walk me to the dance floor, darling
Come out to the dance floor, ooh

As I drive home I can feel my mind race
Wondering what the heck I was thinking in the first place
Rollin' late night chillin' with my friends
Knowing all along with you is where I should've been

If it's not too late, baby girl I'm comin' there
Girl, I can't wait to get some of your lovin'
I'm sorry I made you wait for me
So tonight I'm gonna make it so heavenly

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Listen baby, yeah
I feel like it's raining
Desire is breaking down on me
I wish I'd have stayed in

I shoulda stayed home with you baby, yeah
So I'm comin' home now, oh
So leave the lights on, girl this is our song, baby
Tonight it's gonna be so, oh, baby

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do

Girl, it's gonna be so heavenly
Tonight I'm gonna do things differently
I'm gonna come home and take care of you
And do the special things that lovers do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
