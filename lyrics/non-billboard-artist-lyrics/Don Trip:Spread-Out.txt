Sad momma, midnight I’m goin’ back in
Get all my peso’ up front with no inter rate and no back in
Tucked out with some bad bitch that more than likely an actress
‘Bout to make up a sex tape, all I have to say is egg shit
Baby keep them heels on, I like full splits in back Benz
All the pimpin’ I’m shootin’ at ‘er, I might as well be a med team
(Turn around my dirty run) And my seat belt on fasten
They’re right, I’m domino, I think about time for that cascade
Some of y’all niggers is real hoes
In desperately need of their back-hand
I’m my own boss, I own everything
And that was way before I got a ant ledge
You mad playa, hate to tell ya
Catch up, I’m advancin’
I got a gun me with a drum on it and you don’t want me to clap things

Okay my competition nowhere in sight
And I’m twice the fly as a satellite
Damn right bit, I’m the shit
Flow sicker than a parasite
Mission trip, I’m King Kong
Even though I’m Jack Everett hi
I only get to live one time
So every day is like Saturday night
I’m too concerned with my income
Never considered to have a weapon
Got a brother and all he talk is bait
You gon’ say he Barry White
I heard your tape, I’m not surprised
Twelve songs, all tails are lies
I play your shit from top to bottom
Ain’t feelin’ shit, I’m paralyzed
So involved with this rap shit
So rappers ‘bout to get terrorized
And I don’t do no beef on beat 
So nothing need to be clarified
Fuck you, I’m proud of me
I came a long way from selling dimes
You too confused, I talk money
You too broke, sum out the money
