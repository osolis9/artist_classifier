A-Morbid-Fairy-Tale:Shy One
So many times I tried to feel this way
Everytime I feel I have it
It always seems to go away
And it all just really brought me down
Not really just knowing just how to react
And the past is just haunting me wherever it's found

I'm feeling all alone until this day
So many nerves are running right through my veins
I cannot even see straight can't concentrate
At first glance everything around you was a blur
Everything just stopped in my mind, it was all on her
Fiending for love had me desperate in a sadful way
But today was the day - I felt that way we start to date
Every single day I began to pick her up
I didn't even know of the word enough
Tried to do as much as I can to be a man
Everywhere we went we were holding hands
So happy hoping it will never stop until I'm gone
Didn't think anything on this earth can go wrong
Took her out to eat just about everyday
Just to make her happy, she never had to pay
Whatever she wanted I tried my best to get
I was her Romeo, but was she my Juliet?

She was my angel on this whole entire earth
She was my queen, my light on this earth
Something that I always wanted was to feel this way
Obsessed with love soon drove my mind all way
Slowly and slowly the phone began to never rang
I knew right then and there that something wasn't the same
But blinded by love myself couldn't think
My eyes started to burn everytime I did blink
I was worried and I was stuck in one spot
Waiting outside with the phone in hand, I surely gonna pop
Am I gonna lose this girl who I really truly love?
It felt like I took a hit of a really bad drug
(it was gone)
Our anniversary came up and still received no word
1999 July the 9th, that was the date of worst
Feeling sick and thinking 'bout that day as hours fly by
And I realized to myself, that's the day that I died
