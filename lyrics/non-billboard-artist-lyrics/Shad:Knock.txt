Knock:Shad
when opportunity knocked 
i had to stand up and come forward 
and run towards it 
from jump i didn't want more than 
just to make it thru that front door without frontin 
just one tour, maybe one more 
then suddenly 
the next opportunity knocked and said open up 
one show 
if you're dope enough theyll know whats up 
and sm1 in the front row will notice ya and go home 
and download some stuff and then show it to 
the next opportunity 
soon you might have a platform 
fans to rap for, stamps in your passport, 
some bank - some backboard 
amped up - patch cord - im plugged in 
eyes focused on that door 
the opportunity to give smthg, see it clear 
you need to be aware 
to seize it, to see it's there 
it might not reappear 
no need to fear, just one thing you need to hear 
that knock 
now let it drop… 

i still hear that knock in my dreams (X3) 
that's why theres no stopping my dreams 


sundays i read the times on my iphone 
then sit down and read the times with my eyes closed 
… i feel the winds chillin my bones 
change is in the air and it's blown like cyclones 
see i was raised in the where jay said 
if you wanna feed the poor, you gotta make bread 
… we forgot how to break bread 
and give thanks and never give up givin - we'll stay fed 
now that that day's dead, it's all team biz 
we need kings that serve and queens to lead this 
less tuition more each one teaches 
chuuuch - less preachers more jesus 
trust i hear justice at the door knockin 
saying the ppl need more options 
and i don't mean more coke cans or more soap brands 
cuz more often than not 
the word "choice" just means more shopping 
and less for the boys on the floor stockin 
we got a lot less voice tho theres more talking 
the door's open on that lie now, we see through it 
eyes closed - i read the times and i see music 
it's time for regrouping 
for less ppl trying to be somebody, more ppl trying to be human 
before i leave the room im trying to keep doing 
keep the door open so we can move in 
let's go… 

i still hear that knock in my dreams (X3) 
that's why theres no stopping my dreams
