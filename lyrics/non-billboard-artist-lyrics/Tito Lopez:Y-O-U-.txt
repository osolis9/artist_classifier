Y-O-U-:Tito Lopez
Let me tell you who I am
And what this life really meant to me
Young nigger barely been living the quarter century
Mentally I'm ahead of these lames
Also ow I'm grown, I ain't understanding these games
I'll be in the zone like the drinking weekend song
I'm on a whole other level
Roulette bets with the devil
On whether I'd be successful at this rap sheet
He get read, I'm there
Give me heaven per 7 I'm black bitch
On you, what's the question you?


Well we're basically I've been taking me
Out of my element
And making me question myself
And if I'm relevant
Mistaking me for one of these niggers with no talent
Hating me, make me wanna resolve the violence
Silence is all I need to be good
I just need to be successful I don't need to be hood
I'm trying to grow up, get invited to the Grammy's
Show up, win song get upstage and play all salsa
For you
You got a question over yourself?
You know what they say

I was heaven sent just to represent
I'm y'all boys to the hood I want my nigger
Got choice to show'em just where we come from
Miss me with hat hum drum
Leave a couple of nuts on your face
That's a love song
Punched, about to get beat down
Shots come up in a reason to slow down
I don't speak loud, but deep down I think you boys mad
'Cause I'm doing everything you wish you had
And I do it for you
See just shit down and let me talk 4 minutes

I don't trust nobody in this freaking world
Ain't met a bitch, yeah, fit to be my freaking girl
Y'all on that socialite shit, fuck a socialite
Music and none
All them VH1 assholes they usually from
Demanding me, possess no vanity
Heavy as the hand of G
No D, but I hope he understanding me
Standing three feet away from gold, very patient
Keep the iron on my side for you Barry Masons
And I ain't never had shit
But three heads on the clock
One hand on my dick and one hand on the mic
Just hoping something might slip
Before I'm too old to sit
Pace maker either shit that face like bricks
I get kicks fucking with your mind
For leisure
Staring contests with the blind
See you
Everybody know I can rap but enough
I'm from Mississippi, they all was trying to make it tough
This ...homey X 86
I was born in '87 so in all can take a dick
Take a dip in a pool of acid and let it eat through
Maybe you'll find your heart and be through
Divide for you

Swag door for you
I'd do it for you
All for you
Swag do it for you
Not for me for you
My underdogs
Swag do it for you
To tine own self be truer
