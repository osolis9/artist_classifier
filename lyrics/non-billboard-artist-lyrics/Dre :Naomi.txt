Naomi:Dre 
Now walk it like that chick Naomi
I wanna hit it till da morning
Let me get up in da middle like monie
Now listen girl yous my mothafuckin' homie

Girl I got a suggestion
Hop ya ass in the car
And don't ask me no questions
Ay yo, driver pay attention
What you lookin' in the rear view for huh, Benson

I shoulda pulled out the Bentley Coupe
The GT seats look like Campbell Soup
Mmm, mmm, good you so lovely
You say you from the hood
You sayin' Dre thug me

You want it wit ya iPod on
So you can get hip to all my songs
And we can do it to the beat
It goes boom boom boom boom skeet

Now hoe you like that ma?
The way she screamin' had me thinking
That I mite that broad, check
Mike check 1-2 what is this?
It's a cool and Dre production and a epidemic

Now walk it like that chick Naomi
I wanna hit it till da morning
Let me get up in da middle like monie
Now listen girl yous my mothafuckin' homie

Now walk it like that chick Naomi
I wanna hit it till da morning
Let me get up in da middle like monie
Now listen girl yous my mothafuckin' homie

Naw dog I ain't the one to fuck wit neither
And she so hot, I got the fever
On my side, yep that's where I keep her
Clip full of Z's you can catch some sleep bro

I'm from a city where dey slap dey cheeks
And do tricks on a pole sit in ya lap and speak to ya
Pay attention this a motion feature
Starrin' me and the butt naked slim bo-legged Skeeza

She goin' downtown like SWV, um
That's a little dated wait let me update it
Think Monica Louinski, Paris and Moesha
Head in the hotel sippin' brandy smokin' reefa

And I'm so high ya boi don't lie
That's my homie crack's phantom, I don't own that ride
But I got some black Trojans and it goes quite nice
And what's under ya underneath, ya la perla, I can go all night

Now walk it like that chick Naomi
I wanna hit it till da morning
Let me get up in da middle like monie
Now listen girl yous my mothafuckin' homie

Now walk it like that chick Naomi
I wanna hit it till da morning
Let me get up in da middle like monie
Now listen girl yous my mothafuckin' homie
