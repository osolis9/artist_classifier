Young mula, baby
(Haha, you thought it was over? Let me see)

I wasn't born last night
I know this hoes ain't right
But you was blowning up
Her phone last night
But she ain't have a ring on
Her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart?
When she rather have a purse
Why give a bitch your inch?

When she rather have nine
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything
But trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me)

When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed, smoking marijuana
Rolling up Bob Marley, I'm a rasta
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers

When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it, right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance

Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch

But I don't fuck with broke bitches

Rich young nigga
Name got bigger and my change got bigger
So my chains got bigger
Ferrari, jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screaming out
"Money ain't a thing"
Hah, me and CB in the bay with her
I send her back home
So you can lay with her
Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carrying
All these carrots like
I'm a fucking vegetarian
Shout-out weezy f, keep a red bone wet
Rose rolex, hoes on dick
She knows I got the check
Do it too good when she ride that dick
Man, I wouldn't trust that bitch, no!

Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby, show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby, show me something
You done spent your bread on her
And it's all for nothing
