Dudes-Love-Jay-Z:Ash Kardash
I know niggas love Jay-z, niggas be lowkey crazy
Say they don't love hoes, but they do only God knows
These days I need something different in my life
These days I need somebody to get it right
I don't need no dude that's perfect, I need a dude that's worth it
Don't need no dude bout nothing, I need a dude bout something
These days I need somebody to hold me down
He keep it real and he don't front everytime he come around

Like I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
So if you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
So if you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

Don't need no dude that's cheating, don't need no dude that's lame
Don't need no childish boy that's always tryna run some game
I need a dude to keep it trill and he remains the same
and he won't get behind my back and try to flip and change no
Telling all his friends he don't really be fucking with her no
and then he hang up call back hang up call back woah
and then he hang up call back still blowing up my phone
leave me alone

Cause you got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
So now you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
So now you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
You got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
