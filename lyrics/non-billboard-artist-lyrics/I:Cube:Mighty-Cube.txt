Mighty-Cube:I:Cube
I'm in a cube land
I dig with cold hands
I use these tools to try and climb out of this mess I've made

My door is open
Skeletons and zombies
I am broken, as they walk all over me
But if I keep on building walls, maybe they'll stay away

(pre-)
Think fast, it's got to last if you're gonna make it through the rest of the day
I'm trapped, I can't go back, I've made the choice to stay

And we'll fight... keep defending through the night
(we'll fight the good fight)
Live... we're all driven to survive
(we'll fight the good fight)
I'll keep going, just stay by my side.

(verse 2)
I'm in a cube land
My castle's so grand
And once I lay these tracks I'll finally make my escape

I am no one
I have no place, no one relates
And there is no sun
As the night covers this space
But I beg you, please please don't let this life go to waste
(pre-)
Think fast, it's got to last if you're gonna make it through the rest of the day
I'm trapped, I can't go back, I've made the choice to stay
And we'll fight... keep defending through the night
(we'll fight the good fight)
Live... we're all driven to survive
(we'll fight the good fight)
I'll keep going, just stay by my side.
