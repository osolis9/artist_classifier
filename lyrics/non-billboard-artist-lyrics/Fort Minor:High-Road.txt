High-Road:Fort Minor
Let's go, y'all

These people are runnin' off at the mouth
Tryin' to convince me that I'm runnin' on empty
Tryin' to convince themselves, that the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm makin' is a mistake, and I can't take this

Lemme, tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards, are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks, I take facts and lay 'em out for the masses

You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playin'
Start askin' me the names that I'm not sayin'
But I'm tryin' to be bigger than the bickerin'
Bigger than the petty name calling under the breath talking

Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients
But you can say, what you want about me
Keep talking, while I'm walking away

You can say, what you have to say
'Cuz my mind's made up anyway
I'm takin' the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say, what you have to say
'Cuz my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today, not gonna work today

You people are runnin' off at the mouth
Tryin' to make me take myself off safety
Tryin' to make my friends turn their backs on the team we built
Buildin' up some mistaken information and I can't take this

Lemme, spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complain about the things we do
I'm not changin' direction, I'm steppin' my game up
Maintaining my name, the same way I came up

You're gonna see that I'm not playing
Start askin' the names, that I'm not sayin'
But I'm trying not to mention the names of people
Who wanna sight and attention

You like the hype but pretendin' you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
And you can say, what you want about me
Keep talking, while I'm walking away, bitch

You can say, what you have to say
'Cuz my mind's made up anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say, what you have to say
'Cuz my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today, not gonna work today

Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Is anybody out there listening?
'Cuz I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want, I'll say it again, again

You can say, what you have to say
'Cuz my mind's made up anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you

You can say, what you have to say
'Cuz my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today, not gonna work today
