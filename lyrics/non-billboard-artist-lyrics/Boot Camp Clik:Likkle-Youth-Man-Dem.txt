Likkle-Youth-Man-Dem:Boot Camp Clik
Ride wit me, so easily
To the other side of the Timberland tree
You can walk wit me, smoke freely
On the other of the Timberland tree

Likkle Youth Man dem said, "What's up trooper?"
No disrespect, to Timothy, 'cuz I know how the Utah
You a true star, shine ya light no matter what ya mood for
I got my eye on you, 'cuz you represent the future

We be ya gun busters, your gold rushers
Quick to touch and stuff ya, D.O. quicker picker upper, truth

My mind dwellin', there's no tellin' who you see whore
Ac' and night, pass to the right, 'cuz the weed cause speed ball
Through time laughin', jokin', smokin', talkin' about AK blastin'

Don't make me madder than I am already
Despite it might be a fight, between a loose bullet and a machete
I'm steadily raisin my voice to prove a point
Better be on point, or join inside to put my joint
Like Spike, we might desice to act up
You relax, huh, it was Likkle Youth Man, the attacker

Likkle Youth Man Dem, Likkle, Likkle Youth Man
You can take a walk wit me and see
Likkle, Likkle, Youth Man Dem, Likkle Youth Man
To the other side of the Timberland tree

Ride wit me, so easily
To the other side of the Timberland tree
You can walk wit me, smoke freely
On the other of the Timberland tree

What it is? And welcome to the real world, Dig'
I'm not tryin' to prophecize, I just wanna see ya life
But you insist on bee in face, to let the world mind them
Die die, gon, you curse your mother, wit no problem
And steal a chicken, act fly, you couldn't hold back the cry
When officer mon come give your last pat on ya back side
Offi' take a look at eye, no meet 'em trife and bar
Because I choose Jah and live as Rastafari

You can, touch me, hear me, smell, see and feel me
I pray to God, that makes me real G O D

I see young bloods in the street yards
Talkin' 'bout, peace, God, seen God, became a piece
And nigga slang how hard, to be, but I take you through
If you got a few, do it right, somethin' like the God rule, the yonder do

I see what you mean, I feel, my brother's don't listen
But how to capitalize, is how my rod is fishin'
Deep sea, water, time is gettin' shorter
So books and things, they get tossed upon the brawler

Yea, but a lesson learned is a jewel earned for the keepin'
So I stay reachin' and keep my ass out the precinct

So, whose to say, crews today
Is really what them bullshit out there, that niggas is tryin' to say
Everything I hear, niggas talk about that
They be walkin' the streets, and be off wit the gat
Niggas act like you know, if you don't know how to act
Then ya set ya self up for the Originoo Gunn Clap

We are the wickedest gunn from outta New York
People them talk about them gunn out the buck
You want them to get just brought up, you fooled up
War is in the midst, and the richie wound up deader

Just the other day, my man from around the way
Used to brag to me, how he smoked a pound a day
He said, "Resistance" niggas get hit up wit the instance
Struck from a far, boyakah from a distance

Ride wit me, so easily
To the other side of the Timberland tree
You can walk wit me, smoke freely
On the other of the Timberland tree

As I knowledge the environment, I ascend
On a mission, reminiscin' bout memories missin'
Wishin' bout moves I should of made
Games I should of never played
Nights I should of stayed in the crib

It's been a while since my sun shine
So many dark clouds out tryin' to smother mine
As soon as my boot touch asphalt
Plain clothes and those molds, bee min at my grill, tryin' assault
Out my features, sayin' I match pictures
They had in they possession, said they wanted out for question

No lesson soon that we know never
Where I'm goin', what I'm doin', who, showin' who's proven
All I see is fools gluin' on the corner snoozin'
Choosin' routes that leave them ass out, straight loosin'
Whose in the case to faced for some irrelevant cause
Fightin' was that keep the people back off the walls

Of course you be lookin' out, like feel look out on the spot
'Bout be tooken out, jakes stickin' out, where we hangin' out
So while I'm just tryin' to see how you makin' out
What you thinkin' 'bout, who you thinkin' 'bout
Seein' if it's me then, will it be to make a meanin'
Right now, seems to be the place

Ride wit me, so easily
To the other side of the Timberland tree
You can walk wit me, smoke freely
On the other of the Timberland tree

Ride wit me, so easily
To the other side of the Timberland tree
You can walk wit me, smoke freely
On the other of the Timberland tree
