Frustration:Rottin Razkals
Frustration, how do I release the pain?
Frustration, got a brother goin' insane
Frustration, do what we must to maintain
Frustration, everybody feels the same

Where will I go, who will I see, what will I say
When and if I get to heaven or if I even go that way
I don't know, who calls the shots?
Who says it starts and it stops?
What's what and what's not?

Not me, not you, not I, not who
Not a member of the Double I crew
Take the second letter off frustration
And now I wanna fuss with everybody in the nation

Everybody feels the same
Puff izm, everybody's goin' insane
Racism, everybody feels the pain
But as for me I do what I must to maintain

Do I release, is there ever a time when I'm at my peace?
Be it West or East Coast, I devoted promotes
My life to hip hop for the heart provokes the one that totes
Issuin' heat, givin' they enemies a choke

We ain't a hate cult
We got love but hate for those who traumatize, sodomize
Crook-a-delics in disguise, I'm in a state of frustrate
Now I saw my friend ain't know when

Just say I'm goin' all out
'Cos I ain't givin' in
To my frustration, with my frustration
To my frustration, with my

Frustration, how many ways does it hit us?
Racism, poverty and plenty brothaz put in prison
Real niggaz come from the dayz
Before the childhood of my grandpa

Despise another top of the boat
For the blackness wanted
And crime across the nation
Parents basin', minds are wasted
Disgrace and temptation

No one's involved with education
The limits exceed to live longer than a life span
Man, you take out a chance
And advance from

Four twenty in the morning, I ain't gettin' no sleep
Go problems in my head and the shit is gettin' deep
How a nigga like me gonna make it as a rapper
Just a thief of da bricks that been in and out the slammer

Now I gots to fit in with some type of role models
I used to sling coke out of glass and plastic bottles
Always had loot, off of robbin' other niggaz
These finger signin' autographs used to pullin' triggers

Stay out of this shit, is what my niggaz keep yellin'
I ain't got no loot so ain't no way in hell in tellin'
Waitin' on time gettin' touchy and shit
Even snappin' on some niggaz and throwin' nervous fits

When I was a crook
I ain't had problems like this
'Cos I was in it for self
An' I ain't really give a shit
