The Small Hours
"Shout at the Darkness" 
      on Metallica's
 "Garage days RE-revisited"
         by ????


You shout at the darkness
And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there
You cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air

 Chorus: And I try to get through to you
         In my own special way
         As the barriers crumble at the end of the day


Dark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast
And what of the future
What is to be
As the rivers flow into the sea

 (chorus)

 (groovy stuff & solos)

Do not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair
Time is an illusion
Rising from dying
Steep is the mountain which we climb

 (chorus)
