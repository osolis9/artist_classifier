Break Down... Nah Kid I think not

Took a little time... some of ya'll thought we stopped

Its G.C highly acclaimed... the most mentioned
what you thought.the clothes, the cars, the ice rented

(Maestro)
Toronto Godfather Baby steady spreaded the news
I'm not a rapper, I'm an icon.dont get it confused
Papa Stro since the 80's... been abusing the mic
V.I.P's only Fluid or Life...(too much)
Now why you think that Junos gut a category for rap
who put the T.Dot.O... on the map... answer that...

Too Much for Drugs... Too Much for Thugs
Too Much for Much... Van City.Too Much
Too Much for Haters... Too Much for Players
Too Much for Gators... Too Much for Papers
Montreal... Too Much... Too Much.Too Much.
Too Much... We Still Too Much...

(Kardinal Offishall)

Yooo... Gangster Tingz... Niggaz is dealing with sum Prankster Tingz
Step to this and pick out which hymn you want your mum to sing
The rhyme "Murdera".Yo take them talks outta your mouth
Watch dem things dat you say... Fossie whole you know me.
Mind when the Big Kings are stepping to the mic
Take 10 steps back.kneel.and pray for your life...
And give thanks that I murda sounds and leave it to the tunes
Kardinal and Ghetto.C Luv from June to June

(Red-1)
Yo... Too Much.Too Fabulous
Cantenkerous.Ragga-Muff Northern Touch
They cant bang with us... and handle us
Gut big thangs we brang with us
Roll with the strong... weak cats never ran with us
Regiments Too Strenuous 24/7
Spit the flow... get the dough and get tha women
And slap these catz... with wannabe raps
On mah way out... mah concept ghetto like dat.
Yo how much...
