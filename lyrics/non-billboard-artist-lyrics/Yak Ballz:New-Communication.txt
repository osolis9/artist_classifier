New-Communication:Yak Ballz
[Verse 1]

Who can deny a stare with the mascara, the act’s in her 
Or how official your skin is when your back’s in it
Maybe it’s the attraction to a tortured soul
That leaves most of your lovers in the cold but never me
Disintegrating inhibitions are itching to leap
And indulge in it, but what if I’m not ready?
Or ever will be, guilty as charged
Filthiest heart, it’s like your heart’s in a jar and being tested
It’s been infected, how romantic
Imagine your neckline forming a V behind the fabric
Beauty is classic, cashed up
Fast or feeling in notes spilling straight to the top
And shatter the glass ceiling
And lately I’ve been debating whether this love is fake
And conceiving the thought to let it share each one of our faces
I see that picture, I don’t know if I can paint it
You know I can’t, you ain’t the type that I would ever stay with
So don’t mistake me for being caught in a talented doll face
It’s nothing but a gift from your parents
In the latest fashion draped with passion
Dressed to kill, the queen of the castle goddamnit

[Chorus]

I got your heart, your heart
I know you don’t, you don’t
You want the pieces of my machine
There’s a chance I can’t
See I’ve endured, endured
And I live on and on
The morning is the dawning of us being born, born
I love your style, style
It’s so unique, unique
You think I’m pleasing you because I want you weak, it’s cheap
But I’ve endured, endured
And I live on, on
I will exist in spite of you thinking it’s wrong, I’m gone

[Verse 2]

I see the devil in the details
Haunted jealousy protruding out of your dark brown hair
My mortal enemy, if trust is a timebomb then you be the bomb squad 
If you can defuse me I will let down my guard
Now I won’t open the door if there’s a nightmare hiding behind it
Break down, crash just to fuck up my alignment and so forth
How can you be so sure you finally found
What you was searching for after looking for so long?
You want me to play Odysseus to your Sirens
The guinea pig to your science to sever ties with me
Maybe I’m going overboard now
I’m sinking with my feet chained under the spell you cast (?) 
Totally dreaming awake so far beyond this Sin City
That separates the living from lovers giving it up quickly
And the shoe doesn’t fit me in case you’re wondering
I’m just a flash ten seconds after your thundering

[Bridge]

Trust is a timebomb
Love is a lifeline
Hate is a strong word
When is the right time?
Time is just fool’s gold
The sex is like old news
The silence is so loud
Just what have we come to?

[Chorus then bridge x 2]
