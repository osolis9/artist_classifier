Castles:Bloodline
A thought
A hope 
A dream
And spaces in between
Where suffering goes unseen
A shadow on a screen
Castles built on dreams

A life
A gift 
A plan
A tube inside your hand
The news that makes you reel
Emotions that you feel
Castles built on dreams

Codeine
Takes you far away
To a life remembered yesterday
When dreams and all your hopes
Were always real
Images
And memories
Clouded by insanities
And tears on your bed
Reflect the way you really feel

You’re a star
Shooting across the universe
You’re a song
Missing a final verse
And dreams that you once had
Are now undone
It seems the world
Is upside down
Your castles will
Come falling down
Despite the battles you have won.

Beside you
Someone cried all night
A soldier
Who has lost the fight
With tears 
Falling down
Like swollen streams
Realise 
What’s meant to be
Submit to this reality
Castles built on dreams

Images 
And memories
Clouded by insanities
Dreams disappear through the tears.
