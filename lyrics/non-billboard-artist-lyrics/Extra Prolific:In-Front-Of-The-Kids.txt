In-Front-Of-The-Kids:Extra Prolific
Sit a little bit closer, who's the man supposed ta
Give you that good time feelin' on vibes at shows?
Amounts, accounts, how I bounce without
Negativity but yet I still turn it out

When I was young I hung among them, that one sex
With thin flats, enough to pump and stuff and then back for more
Drank a little forty, called black women 'Whores'
(Bitch)
Now this shit is still in store

It ain't no harm, you're just an etcetera instead of the
Regular, bigger the better, holding your sweaters
Writin' your letters, see all this changed
When we're in front of the kids

If none of ya did nothin' I'd still be the same
So come borrow some scratch, that's if I'm livin' phat
I'm hollerin' out the ol school partners but I'm givin' back
It makes no difference if a prince were rollin' gun
If not then she wouldn't have to run

Now don't disturb this groove, that I made, you been played
It's fine and smooth, I just was one plus I'm dope and rhymin' too
This package is complete, some need to stand it
But heavy hand it to the man in demand

Unique, you weak, you freaks, so spit the language I speak
I seek, I cheat when I'm in languishin' beats
Up the strip bumpin' E-40 and The Click
Sick from jumpin' on hoes for numbers, I know you wonder

Why act up in front of the kids but don't sweat it, come on y'all
Use some common sense, put it in your hand, rub it, don't pet it
Confusin', who's in charge?
Choose to race, hold your place, don't lose your mark

Ain't nothin' better than the man that can expand
The band of a camera, get the picture, switch ya just to hammer ya
What can I do?
(When we're in front of the kids)
When there ain't no where to run to
