Wicked:Elijah Blake
This feels like we've already met before
You're mind is ready for me to explore
Those other guys, they left a bad report
Just say what you need, I'll be that and more

Don't act so heaven sent
Cause I know you're love is wicked
You say you're innocent so I'm leaving because

Love will make you
Dum-dum-da-da-dee-dee-dum-dum-na-ay
Dum-dum-da-da-dee-dee-dum, cause you're love is wicked
Dum-dum-da-da-dum-dum-dum-na-ay
Dum-dum-da-da-dee-dum-dum, you're love is wicked
Wicked
Wicked because you're irresistible
This urge I feel is even more than you know
How could somebody ever break your heart
Girl I'll protect you even when you're far
Don't act so heaven sent
Cause I know you're love is wicked
You say you're innocent so I'm leaving because

Love will make you
Dum-dum-da-da-dee-dee-dum-dum-na-ay
Dum-dum-da-da-dee-dee-dum, cause you're love is wicked
Dum-dum-da-da-dum-dum-dum-na-ay
Dum-dum-da-da-dee-dum-dum, you're love is wicked
Wicked
If I had, youre love
I would tell the world, tell the world, about your paradise
I would tell the world, I would tell the world, about your love
Yes I would tell the world, I would tell the world, about your love
But, if you want this to be a secret
I din't know if I can keep it
Nobody wants to be your weekend, lover
I wanna shout it out
Bad bitch on my radar (shout it out)
Bad bitch on my radar (shout it out)
Bad bitch on your
You the only bad bitch on my radar (shout it out)
Bad bitch on my radar (shout it out)
Bad bitch on your
