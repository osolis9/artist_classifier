I-Am-Thunder-:Silencer
I scream through the air, winter sky eats my fire
They feel the shockwave below
At the edge of the world, my power plants cry
I'll show the yanki our might.

I am thunder, comrades
Glorious thunder
We are the first, the last
Above this world

I bring superior air power
Stare death in the eye
Witness superior air power
Faster than all

I bring superior air power
Stare death in the eye
Witness superior air power
Faster than all

I am superior airpower
Witness superior airpower
I am superior airpower
Witness superior airpower

We go
Higher than
Farther than
Faster than
Stronger than all
