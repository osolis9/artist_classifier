Now, I don't mean to sound rude, baby or hurt ya or nothin
I want a slim, fine woman who is workin with somethin, twurkin with somethin

If you a slim, fine woman that mean you workin with somethin
I want a big, fine woman with some pop wit her
She ain't got a lot of ass but tiddy-bop wit her
Now I came here to get it buck
for you hoes shake down if you wanna wobble, what
Back it up or toot it up or don't stop
Won't you bend that ass over now pop it like it hot
Put yo head between your legs and touch your toes
Bounce your booty up and down--Ooh girl, there you go
Won't ya walk like a model
If you a independent woman, maybe I'ma holla
You got your hair fixed nice, wit ya clothes tight
You wanna shake it like a dog and do it all night, all night
Now assume the position and get it right
Put your hands in the air, won't you make ya tiddies fight

I wanna see ya turn around and stick ya booty out, ya booty out
