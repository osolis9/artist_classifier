Fatally-Wounded:Gemstone
Fatally wounded
That's how you left me
Before you started
Sprung a spring
And hit the target
You pulled the pin now
Get me started... get me started...

How many chances do you give?
While you've got the face on down the pub
The one that says, you'll try your luck

Fatally wounded
That's how you left me
Before you started
Sprung a spring
And hit the the target
You pulled the pin now
Get me started... get me started

I try to learn to hate your eyes
The place that draws them to your lies
Your green lurded bait
It sealed my fate

Fatally wounded
That's how you left me
Before you started
Sprung a spring
And hit the the target
You pulled the pin now
Get me started... get me started

Small clues now all fit together
Of the countdown to your departure
Booked in first class
Thoughts fading fast

Fatally wounded
That's how you left me
Before you started
Sprung a spring
And hit the the target
You pulled the pin now
Get me started... get me started
