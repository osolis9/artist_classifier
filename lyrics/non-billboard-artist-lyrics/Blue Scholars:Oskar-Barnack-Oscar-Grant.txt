(We got the right to bear arms, but...)
Shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Take your cameras out ya pockets people,
Shoot the cops,
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Take your cameras out ya pockets people

If they wanna shoot at us, got a right to shoot 'em up
They shoot us in the back but they say it's from the front
You're warned, even if you aren't armed,
They will find an excuse to do you harm if they think you out of line
In every city's urban jurisdiction you will find
Some people making livings that are creeping from behind
And even if behavin' most the time man they know
If an officer to blame they need to let it go (let it go, let it go)
With a family at home, a mortgage to support
In times where it's hella hard as fuck to find a job
If you wanna keep yours you better not inform
Don't wanna be the side the wrong side of the law
But guess what, the people got a weapon of their own
The lens and a shutter built into a mobile phone
Evidence admissible in court
even more documented cases of what's been goin' on

Shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Take your cameras out ya pockets people,
Shoot the cops,
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Take your cameras out ya pockets people

I hear 'em saying that this shit don't ever happen in Seattle
And if it does it's really just a couple bad apples
But if you're keepin' count you will see
This shit is not the apple, it's the tree, it's rotten underneath
O' say can you see, no way that it's true
They don't wanna see another South Central '92 or Seattle '99
Even if it happens what they sayin' on the news
Bad people mad justifyin' the abuse
And youth, especially the ones with darker features bein' targeted to boot
And true, some people can't handle the truth
Now keep that feelin' in mind when you pull that camera out and ask a pig to smile at you
I ain't talkin one, I'm talkin three or four or five
What you so afraid of if you ain't committin' crime?
We are merely doin' what a citizen should do
Better act right if I were you the world is watchin' you.

We gotta shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Take your cameras out ya pockets people,
Shoot the cops,
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Sh-sh-shoot the cops
Take your cameras out ya pockets people
