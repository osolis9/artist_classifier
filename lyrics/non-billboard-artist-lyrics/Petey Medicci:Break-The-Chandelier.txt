Ey..Stop playing
Shake that ass on a nigga
Quick bands if you can get low
It's like quick sand
That ass got me stuck
The way you throw it
Make a nigga want to fuck
Girl I ain't playing with you
Im going to put the pussy in a body bag
Hope you can take dick 
I got a lot of that
If you can take dick

It aint tricking if you got it 
I got plenty racks
Girl drop it on the floor 
Show me that you can get low
Aww girl I said drop it on the floor 
Show me that you can get low
