Highway:Lake
I lay alone at night and often think of you
Each minute seems an hour of wondering what to do
I light a cigarette and turn the music loud
The lights are flashing now I'm on a crazy cloud

I'm riding Highway 216
Everybody knows the way you're turning on my dreams
Everybody knows I'm riding Highway 216
No questions why or where
You'll never have a care
Because they slip away into the day

Forget me when I go those were the words she said
But still I see her face a-laughing in my head
It was a crazy game the stakes were much too high
The blackbird broke a wing they say he'll never fly

I'm riding Highway 216
Everybody knows the way you're turning on my dreams
Everybody knows I'm riding Highway 216
No questions why or where
You'll never have a care
Because they slip away into the day

I'm riding Highway 216
Everybody knows the way you're turning on my dreams
Everybody knows I'm riding Highway 216
No questions why or where
You'll never have a care
Because they slip away
