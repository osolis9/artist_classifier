Owe:Vic Spencer
Pulled up to the chi venue and felt out of bounds
Tonight my conscious told me to hang with the clowns
But instead I lit one then conversate with the clouds
Full blown debate with em about who holds the crown
That be I, the illest guy, no compromise
For the squad I gotta ride
ESR, Brainiac, SAVEMONEY I got shit that yeeen heard
Me and Suli the only niggas repping teamwork. (pbbt)
The motives is real, the scrotum is sealed in Victormized Gear, my heart quilted with skill
I run fast I'm on the panthers heels ; Creepy like how tarantulas feel I'm Zeus off that cannibus kill
I had ya sister spanish my meal
Mannish in US Cellular Field, I chilled with Jack Rooney for real
I signed deals with Tom Vandenberk
Used my gift err where write bars while I stand in church
Smoking weed with some Jewish niggas that I never knew
Forever Jet Blue which means I flyer than you
Not material wise, guys, I graduated High School
And rappers can't get pass that, they raps half-ass
This ain't rap, this a jab jab
Stand over dead bodies with the last laugh, han-han
I'm from a city where we love to carry substance
Smoke weed in carver high school, the same at DePaul
I was the Rookie of the Year in '82 like Terry Cummings
A nigga hands was on the ass of a married woman
You rap like Vic you never could fail
Who I sound like? You never can tell
The rapping bastard rose from the dead now he a legend
Different personalities I promise you couldn't sketch it
They say that I'm a character or I'm too animated
Well at least my flows ain't outdated
And nobody else can say the work harder
They didn't graduate high school so they swear that they smarter
I tell all my weed heads to spark up
I tell retarded rappers that I own a charter
I got a boss but I'm still the CEO of all zoos
When ioon want shit that's when I'll call you
But I only hear from niggas when they wanna fuck me over
Niggas out here owe me they life wife and a Range Rover
Heaven blessed me with 2 of the 3
You can't say the same so how the hell you fucking with me
These new rappers will try to use ya
That's why I work with underground rappers non famous producers
And I don't do it to say I did it first, you niggas is dirt
I swear to god y'all the worst, my mother owns the earth
You and yo crew is just grass that lives in it
The beats covered in water, that's how a nigga replenish
All his raps, I'm from the barrel with the crabs
They tried to pull me down but I move around fast
100% while niggas carry a bitch trait
I'm rapping better than ever mane, Vic straight
Why do niggas call mixtapes a tape? Shits corny
When they wasn't around when tape decks was important
That's not shot if it was I'll block it
Dekembe was mad when saw my stats
R and b need to have amerie and Sade back
It should be a crime how I BODY tracks
I leaped off one foot into the earth soul
I was blind but I continued to let that work show
Scars stars and stripes, no army
I got bars to write, no parties
4 wheel drive, no Harleys
Zoom on my feet 60 miles per hour car speed
Look at my face in Old Polaroids
Thinking I was ugly as FUCK I couldn't stroke a toy
Like, back in '08, they didn't know the boy
At least my daughter know all of my lyrics that shit brings me joy
I put her on my album because she special
She 6 and already gotta a persona you couldn't be next to

I owe her the world...
