Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Report to the dance dance dance floor
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Report to the dance dance dance dance dance floor

I'm feelin' so energetic
Don't think y'all will ever get it 

The floor is callin' me
And I don't know what else to do
The energy in here is fire
And the speakers too
See the DJ hittin' that replay
Do what he say and turn me on
Imma do a lotta talkin' with my feet
And the beat and I promise don't need no phone

Put me on 
Report to the dance floor
Put me on 
Report to the dance floor

I'm feelin' so energetic
Don't think y'all will ever get it 

Meet me in the club 

I feel like I'm up there abo- abo- above the clouds
Did you meet my speaker?
Ain't he, ain't he, ain't he talkin loud?

Don't he beat the floor
Don't he beat the floor
Don't he beat the floor
That's that and I ain't gotta say no more

I'm feelin' so energetic
Don't think y'all will ever get it 

Meet me in the club 

Report to the dance floor

Put me on

I'm feelin' so energetic
Don't think y'all will ever get it
