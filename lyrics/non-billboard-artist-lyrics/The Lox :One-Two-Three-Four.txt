We ain't positive, but we ain't negative 
The cops got guns, and they dont like us where we live 
Take notes, I'm smokin' a roach, holding my toast 
Givin' my quotes, to the shorties livin' with dope 
You think it ain't real, until you caged in 
And you can't hit a feel, you keep the rage in 
Cuz you never made a mil' so we keep it blazin' 
And the fagots on the hill, fucking niggas girls 
But they keep them on the pill, a dog where you at 
Cuz the honey is tight ill, everything is real
