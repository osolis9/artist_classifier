Look into my eyes See the world I see Sides(?) of you and me Together...
Hear into my ears Get rid of your fears Listen to the drums
I want to be with you
They take us back to where we were
Taste into my tongue Breathe into my lungs Please don't put a stop to my endeavor.
Touch into my skin Feel the love within I want to be with you Forever...
