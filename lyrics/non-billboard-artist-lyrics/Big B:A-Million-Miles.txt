A-Million-Miles:Big B
(Feat. Tech N9ne)

Man life's a funny thing
The ups and downs and the... brings
The hard aches you get from chasing your dreams
You spend your whole life trying to make it
You finally get the chance so you take it
Not realizing how much is about to change
And the consequences that come with this thang
... thing of the past
No time to slow down cause you're moving fast
Gotta keep it moving don't know how long it will last
People saying it ain't the same as before
People thinking you ain't the same no more
But ain't nothing change, just make the call
I'll be at your door cause
True friends are friends to the very end
And don't let days come between them

I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
But when the shit goes down I'll be right there
Whenever you need, whenever you need
You better believe I'ma be right there
I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
But when the shit goes down I'll be right there
Whenever you need, whenever you need
You better believe I'ma be right there

I ran away for so long and I'm feeling sickly
On the road, I can't see in L.A. where my kids be
I know they miss me, while I'm out making history
... when I'm coming home it's a mystery
I'm doing shows now, but if it goes down
... angel, they won't be given a whole cloud
Cause I can... taking my foes down
Come around goes round, nobody knows... 
When it come to my babies then I go stupid and crazy
Thinking up anything, they got so many dreams
That's why I'm... became the city king
... I can be a million miles away trust me
When my babies in need... 
All of my family because they love me
When... appear, I will be right there... 

I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
But when the shit goes down I'll be right there
Whenever you need, whenever you need
You better believe I'ma be right there
I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
But when the shit goes down I'll be right there
Whenever you need, whenever you need
You better believe I'ma be right there

Don't let them try to tell you otherwise
Don't let them try to fill you head with those lies
I still remain the same, I don't get changed... 
I wish I could be home every day, never never have to go away
But you know I can't make a living that way
Nobody knows it ain't a doing... truly
I'm in love with this music, I got a quest to prove I'm one of the best
I refuse to give up just like the rest
Sorry, I gotta pick up with this moment
Don't worry, you gotta be strong
Cause all it takes it's one call, that's it
And I promise I'll be... quick
Don't ever... guss, you better believe it

I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
But when the shit goes down I'll be right there
Whenever you need, whenever you need
You better believe I'ma be right there
I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
But when the shit goes down I'll be right there
Whenever you need, whenever you need
You better believe I'ma be right there
I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
I could be a million miles from nowhere, nowhere
