Please-Everybody:Que
It's been a long time since I done helped myself, ova n ova i done stressed myself. Keep telling myself slow down and catch my breath ooooohh........And Lord knows I'm doing all I can. I find myself thing I'm only one man. Chain smokin to deal wit all my pain, knowing cancer runs in my fam........n I'm a hero to them like it's an S on my chest, if I break down it'll be a domino effect........N my momma keep on telling me to leave the drank alone but I'm like momma when I'm high the only time the rain is gone wish I could hit my grandma on her cell just to tell her that sometimes her baby feel like ......... All I got is this L, all I got is this drank, reflecting to myself, sit around and just thank
