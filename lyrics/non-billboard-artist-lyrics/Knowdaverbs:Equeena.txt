Equeena:Knowdaverbs
[Chorus: Jason Eskridge]
Lemme tell you 'bout this girl named Equeena I met
You'll never meet a girl like Equeena I bet
But if you ever shall than consider you blessed
She's rich beyond the natural so my spirit's impressed
[Verse 1: Knowdaverbs]
Had an encounter with this gal at Grammatical show
She was looking unfamiliar but someone I'd like to know
So I thought possibly could she be of the same mind
Taken by her beauty but was anxious to find.
Out. See what this woman was all about
but I doubt I'll get the time of day so I'm out
I thought to myself, you'll never know until you ask her
Well, I tend to dig the chicks that do agree with my pastor
So I inquired 'bout her name she threw it out but I missed it
at first I had the jitters to nervous to even listen
Shook her hand said, "Hi, I'm Knowda or Verbs is what's preferred."
She cracked a smile like a baby and I'm glad that part occurred
With that she broke the ice the conversation was nice
Should I ask her for her number? Don't think twice
I tried to stay on my toes and kick the lines that were witty
and avoid saying things like, "Gee, Equeena you're so pretty!"
Kept my cool and maintained never thought she saw me sweat
But I never will forget the day that we met
She had an ill type of radiance you felt when her presence
With a certain type of glow like lamps that be florescent
Her own type of flav that stretched from head to toe
I think when she was made they went and dipped the mold in gold
The way she moved was angelic she my eyes dance
At first I was a skeptic at this love at first glance
A couple of hours have passed we've shared some things an we've laughed
In my book from one to ten she rates eleven and a half
You can tell she opened up as the time flew by
She was no plain Jane looking for the average Joe
Equeena had plans she's not the type to live trife
She wants to graduate from college wants to live a Godly life
She wants to go wherever she feel God leads her
Wants to hook up with a man that honestly feels he needs her
So the fact that we actually crossed paths it all seems odd
She let me know first off she wants a man who seeks God
So I thought BINGO! Can I please be a contestant?
Thanking God for early Christmas an unwrapped present
He must've reached into the heavens took the fixing's and the makens
and made the girl of my dreams that I could see when I'm awakened
The time drew near for us to part for the momento
got her little backpack took some paper and passed a pencil
Needless to say by that I was deeply flattered
taking note of her fragrance and the way her eyes have battered
I explained her the blessing just to meet her acquaintance
she gave a hug and I was like a king
It's like I can't just say goodbye somebody call the F.B.I
I've caught a case of the love bug and can't deny
But wonder why? We came so close at an escalated rate
I think she's in the Syllabus, man God is great!
Strong, bold and demanding that makes the girl outstanding
Often imitated and simulated but never is she replicated or emulated
