Go-with-It:The Internet
feat. Vic Mensa 


[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Pull up on my job and make ‘em go work
We hit the singles club, her hips are double time
Got three funnels to sweep but she don't care she get some money first
I understand to feel myself, I started from the dirt
Now I’m just like clean, our goal is to flip a silver dollar out a dream
I mean it looks just how it seems
Apologize if that came off as open-ended
She took it as back-handed and got offended
Like you know what you different
You think everybody bitch is the same
And boy don't you know them chips can dip as quick as they came
I came to the scene she want the taste of the F-A-M-E
As the end she went to lick it she ca-ca-ca-ca-came
Tell you like your voice, let your hips do the talking
Contrary to what you think they really say this often
But watching you [?] you really wanna know
With your mind, if you with it we can go

[Hook: Syd the Kyd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time
You're learnin’ baby
Girl, you’re so good

[Verse 2: Syd the Kyd]
By the way, I knew she was looking for me
By the way that she crossed her legs
I knew she wanted something, something
Loving, loving, all the way
Baby if you let me I can show you how to loosen up
Take a chance and dance with me, relax and let your hair down
I really want to make a joke and I know you want me too babe
It’s true babe

[Hook: Syd the Kyd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time
You're learnin’ baby
Girl, you’re so good

[Bridge: Syd the Kyd]
It’s alright babe, alright babe
You know you got me giving it up
You know you like me, like me
Baby go with the flow
Oh, yeah
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake
Don’t stop baby, don’t stop baby
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake

Hey, what you doing after this?
Word, well um
Won’t you go get your friends
Lets get out of here
Ready?

[Hook: Syd the Kyd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time
You're learnin’ baby
Girl, you’re so good
