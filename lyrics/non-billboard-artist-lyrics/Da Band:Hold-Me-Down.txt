Shot caller dudes stop as soon as I speak

Got a high pitched flow MC Mariah
When I walk down the streets niggaz squeak their tires
Got every club promoter passin' me flyers

With a bottle of haze, my weave is so tight
I'm ready for some action, hands in the air
Crystal over here in the club no beer

Stuntin' bad girl, I do it for nothin'
Tight dickies shirt with a pop top button
Babs repeat it I'm something that the rap game needed
Thorough bread plus I stay weeded

Attendin' business meetings with a 40's and my dirty flows
Everyday's an episode all because them episodes
Just like rats they wanna know where my cheddar flows

Everyday like valentine, how I keep it rollin'?
Never made a dime from rap yet
I thank them people no my people don't believe it though
Someone has been leavin' those words sayin' cold

You think I don't know you serving Coke
'Cause you ain't a dude alive that couldn't carry their Coke
So it must be them freakin' po po's I hope they better pray
They don't run up wrong or your momma gonna be singin that song
