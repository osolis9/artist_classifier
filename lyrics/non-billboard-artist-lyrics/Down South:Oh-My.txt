Oh-My:Down South
History prefers legends
It remembers the battles and forgets the darkness.
You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence The crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises Ten thousand ways to lose
And you held it all
But you were careless
To let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side
Powerless
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the
end.
I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend.
You'll never know what I became because of you.
Ten thousand promises
Ten thousand ways to lose
And you held it all
But you were careless
To let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side
Powerless
And you held it all
But you were careless
To let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side
Powerless
Powerless
Powerless
