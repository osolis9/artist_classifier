Ha-ha-ha-ha, yeah

(I forgot)
Jam on it
(Oh)
(Oh, Chilly B, get down, ho)
(Uh, oh, here comes Cozmo)
(Ho)
(Do we get to say wikki-wikki-wikki again?)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki
(Shut up)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki

Three words to the whack are "step yourself back"
'Cause we're gettin' down, and ain't givin' no slack
Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs
We're throwin' down with a rack of Bozaks
One time, in your mind you see
You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you've funked enough, make sure you pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
Shake your booty and scream, Oh, yeah
Cause we are the Jam-On Crew
And jammin' on it is how we do the do
We'll funk you up until you boogie down
So come on people check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound

(Jam on it)

Say, don't ya hear the sound
Jam-On is gettin' down

(Jam on it)

Allow me toduce myself, my name is Chilly B
And I'm a surefire, pure blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, come put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I've got no flaws ‘cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
‘Cause when I was a little baby boy my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like "Dolomite"
As time went by, on this God's creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam-On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
Clean out your ears and you open your eyes, if you wanna hear the music just come alive
An if you don't know how get ready to learn
Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn

You take a C, an O and a Z
Then you add M-O and a freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this y'all, rock that y'all,
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomotive ride off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock you to the rhythm of my funky sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
A when Jam On's rockin' everybody screams (Jam on it)
Jam on it
Jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you wanna dance all night
Then go on ahead and flaunt it
‘Cause jammin' on is what we do best
It's what separates us from the rest
And if you don't think our crew's down for real
Let me tell you what happened to the man of steel

(Say Superman had came to town to see who he could rock)
(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached our block)
(His speakers were three stories high, with woofers made of steel)
(And when we brought our set outside, he said "Hah, be for real!")
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fan to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and the ladies think it's sweet
(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)
(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)
(And just when he had pulled the crowd and swore he'd won the fight)
We rocked his butt with a 12 inch cut called "Disco Kryptonite"
(Rock'em Cozmo!)
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, 'You rock so naturally'
I said now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space, I came to rock the human race
I do it right ‘cause I can't do it wrong
An that's why the whole world is singin' this song

(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
As days turn to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is I wanna hear you say
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-m-m-m-m, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
Keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound

(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
with the sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
and don't you dare stop till early mornin'

Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

(Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo)
(You rocked it, that's the way you do it)
(Yeah, like, did you see when he went in the corner)
(And he started doin' this)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)

(Ah, man, this is too funky for me)
(I'm goin' home)
(Hey, Mergatroid, let's go)
(Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid)
(She was standin' over here just a minute ago)
(Yeah, I think I saw her over there with Grand D)
(He's rockin' the mic, you know)
(Diggy dang diggy dang da dang dang da diggy diggy diggy dang dang)
(Di-r-r-r-ggy dang diggy diggy)

(This beat is fresh ya'know)
(Yeah, fresh)

Say, don't ya hear the sound
Jam On is gettin' down
