Boomerang-feat-Rhett-:Skee-Lo
Verse 1: 
Last night was the illest, got the limo, Phyllis. Tuxedo, Skee-Lo; what the deal is. Like Judge Etto, see me on the D-Lo. On the freeway, with the windows down yelling party people! We took a picture, hit it Flicka! Flicka! See my lady that’s my baby isn’t she a looker. Blossoms like a virgin in a room full of hookers. Took us; thirty-five minutes before we got there. We stopped at Ben & Jerry’s, told my cousin Barry. I think I like her, I think I want to marry. She could be my wife & all my children she would carry. He looked at me & said that isn’t necessary. She asked me what I do. I told her I was new. I’m really from Chicago but LA is where I grew. Any situation I just want to be with you; I put it in an envelope & address it from me to you, don’t go! 
Chorus: 
We tried to go, down separate roads. So we through each other away; but we should have known. We weren’t meant to be alone. Cause our love’s like a boomerang. 
Verse 2: 
My girls ex-man, just got him a new car. Nice BMW sitting on five-stars. But that aint nothing new because he got five cars & his house, is right around the corner from ours. So she’s always telling me this & that, how I need to get some money running off at the yap. When I told her; all I want to do is rap, she told me to get out! Don’t come back! She didn’t even care about the fact I lost my job; I use to work security until the place got robbed. I just looked her in the eyes, rolled up my sleeves. I don’t need you anyway, I was ready to leave! I done been here before, seven times or more. It’s got to be, more than one way to connect four, cause it can’t rain forever; maybe change is better. I’m sick of looking at gray skies & bad weather. Just go! 
Chorus: 
We tried to go, down separate roads. So we through each other away; but we should have known. We weren’t meant to be alone. Cause our love’s like a boomerang. 
Verse 3: 
When I met you; you just wanted somebody to chase down. Tell me that I love you then you got to stay down. Your three year old son looks more like Mace now. Fuck what you was saying; just look at his face now! You lied to me, you tried to do me. You got to go. All this I’m sorry, I missed you. I don’t know. Heard it all before, talk shows & more; and more & more chicks get stuck with NO doe. Just go! 
Chorus: 
We tried to go, down separate roads. So we through each other away; but we should have known. We weren’t meant to be alone. Cause our love’s like a boomerang.
