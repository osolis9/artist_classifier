[Hell Razah:]
They say I got a conscious flow
A box full of Optimus
Got tell a bomb squad Sharon's 'bout to blow
Plant a seed then water it and watch it grow
Since Bush stole the skull of Geronimo
We roll deeper then the Navajo with calico
My halo glow like a U.F.O.
I throw lava in volcano
Kill how Cain did Abel with no label
What you bringing to this round table?
I sit amongst Kings, Prophets and Black Angels
Who speak truth on our truce angles
The youth dangle of a rope in the prison cell
We don't wanna sell dope but we living in hell
The Black male DNA from the blood cell
I drink up from the Holy Grail
Can't even trust even a email
They got my name misspelled as El-Razial
Written with the finger of God
I'm a Rayon, rhyming aligning the stars
I'm the top shelf liquor by the bomb
Cognac with a honey dip Cuban cigar

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
It go; one for the money
Two for the divas
Three niggas snuck into the club with their heaters
Four more bottles of pop I'm too killer
My swag got iller
The Black Pancho Villa
I want my spot back I'm a Indian Giver
My flow be the Nile River
I deliver like liquor on a bad liver
You ain't a killer you're wired with a transmitter

It go; one for the hungry
Two for the eaters
Three more Presidents come to deceive us
World War IV; report to new leaders
My swag got iller
The Black Pancho Villa
I want my spot back I'm a Indian Giver
My flow be the Nile River
I deliver like liquor on a bad liver
You ain't a killer you're wired with a transmitter

[Hell Razah:]
Check it, I spit a 62 kilo, you not Gambino
I'm Black Cherokee; it's locked like the c-notes
I watch for the egos and drop 30 c-notes
32 shots in the the peek-hole
These niggas wanna re-vote
Therefore I feed 'em to the revolt
The Loc's and the Young Bloods with love for the revolt
What you mad at me for? I'm business like Nino
My 16 blowing like C-4
Hide in the planes up in heat throat
Legal or illegal we gon' eat tho'
At 15 we turning into Ninos
Hoes in that Christian Dior who sip semen befo'
Come through the door then she leaving in war
Condoleezza Rice rolling da dice and yo life
George Bush wanna cheat on his life it's so trife
It's still a plantation, slave making of a Freemasons
If you awake you'll see the son of Satan

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
