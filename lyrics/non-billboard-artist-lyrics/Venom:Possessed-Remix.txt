Possessed-Remix:Venom
Look at my eyes and you will see
Fire is burning inside of me
Fire it burns
Fire it burns
Look at the children
Look at my eyes
Look at me Satans child
Born of evil thus defiled
Brought to life through Satanic birth
Raised in Hell to live on Earth
Come look at me and I'll show you
Things that will open your eyes
Come listen to me and I'll tell you
Things that will sicken your mind
We drink the vomit of the priests
Make love with the dying whore
We suck the blood of the beast
And hold the key to deaths door
Through many a tormented night prevail
Thy excorsions can but fail
Though crucifix doth durn my flesh
I shall not yield to you unless I die!
I am possessed by all that is evil
The death of your God I demand!
I spit at the virgin you worship
And sit at my lord Satan's left hand
I care not for the priests who are crying
I answer to Baphomet's call
A cry for help from the dying
Means nothing to me at all
I am decreed by lord Satan's fine evil
To destroy what all mortals love most
Satan is my master incarnate
Hail praise to my unholy host
Look at my eyes!
