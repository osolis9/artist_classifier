Jealous-Girl:Another Bad Creation
[Chorus:]
Fellas there's a jealous girl in our town ohh baby.
Fellas there's a jealous girl in our town ohh baby.

I know you feel bad about me and my girl
But I gave you the first chance to be in my world
Now you are saying things to keep us apart
I gave you the first chance to be in my heart
When I loved you you didn't love me
Our love had no unity
All you ever told me were lies
It's my girl I know you dispise

[Repeat Chorus:]

Girl I really hope you find another
Cause I can't take no more of you trying to be my lover
You see I've got all I want and all I need
So girl would you please go on and just leave
When I love you you dint love me our love had no unity
All you ever told me were lies
It's my girl I know you dispise

[Repeat Chorus:]
