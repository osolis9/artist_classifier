Blade---Come On 


Yo, with the body of a goddess 
Make no mistake about 
Never was a good cook 
So plenty cats ate out 
Catch me at a steakhouse 
Cats be on a stake out 
Wanna hear what I drop 
Cop when the tape out 
Hit the Av with my dudes 
Break out and shake out 
I'm rude I'll eat your food 
Chicks f*** for take out 
It's the B to the L to the A-D-E 
Got stacks, spinnin' like vinyl when the crates out 
Let's see sexy, plus mami got dough 
I get your s*** wired like Donnie Brasco 
Got a mic and a host rockin' cowboy hats 
With them wild boys cats, tote loud noise cats 
Sex niggas with a gun in my weave 
Gold digga, trust no nigga, one in my sleeve 
From the B-E-D-S-T-U-Y I put it down for my b***** 
Let's see you try, come on 

1 - Number one rap, fun stack 
Got that rock that 
Get guns cock back 
Been there done that 
One check two check 
Three check four 
Hot s***, new s*** 
You check four 

I keep blinks in the safe 
Rock minks to the waist 
Exquisite crocks and lizards for the spots I visit 
Throwing drinks in his face 
Only blink when it's safe 
Cats handing me more A-V-L me Manny and Mo 
Ain't no stoppin' the cockin' 
Hey y'all it's the Blade y'all, no flow rockin' 
Like my s*** hell no mo' poppin' 
For dolo, from Soho to Rod-eo shoppin' 
Back to the block a hot watch and suits 
New s***, gold I'm throwin' rocks on the tooth 
You see me when I ball and it's not with hoops 
And while you shop for boots I shop for coupes 
Gas cats like Exxon with the Lex on 
Not a lot salute I'm too hot for Duke 
Plus proper too, I'm unstoppable 
So f*** with me, that's what not to do, come on 

Repeat 1 (2x) 

Now where my S to the T to the U-Y niggas 
Screamin' f' the D's true you my niggas 
Lowkey, OG, Old E sippers 
OT, no sleep, hold heat niggas 
Sippin' booze till they spittin' news 
Ain't s*** to do 
Whips I pick and choose 
Head whips pickin' in twos 
If it's Blade you runnin' with 
Get your kicks and shoes 
Number one till I die 
Come on ain't s*** to lose 
If you play dummy you die 
Now you wondering why? 
Cause I'm from the Stuy like that shit under your eye 
I do it up, bad b**** suited up 
Boot it up, suit it up 
For loot we shoot 'em up 
Truly scar y'all with two revolvers 
Keep my hair and nails done 
Fresh out the beauty parlor 
B-E-D-S-T-U-Y I put it down for my niggas 
Let's see you try 

Repeat 1 (2x)
