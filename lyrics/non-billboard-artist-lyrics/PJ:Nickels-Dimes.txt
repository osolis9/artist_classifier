Nickels-Dimes:PJ
Chorus
Don't make sense how it works out 
We just know that it does 
And It don't always makes sense now
But know it always adds up
Nickels & Dimes
Oh na na Nickels & Dimes (x2)

Verse 1
Crazy when I woke up this morning I was still in debt, shit
I'm still waiting on a check 
Got home and it's bills from last week still sitting in the mail / That I haven't paid yet
Ima get the clothes that I want but the prices ain't fair, even when they on sale
One day everything that i need will be sitting in my hand 
I just ain't there yet 
Oh 
But everybody goin' through it, everybody goin' through it
See everybody going through it, everybody going through it

Chorus 
It don't make no sense how it will always add up Nickels & Dimes

Verse 2
Lookin' back on my moms I can't even comprehend how she did what she did
Droppin' out & takin' two jobs / Taking care of two kids , yeah 
Taco Bell to pay the rent / She did it with no money, mo problems out here ye-ahhhh
So when it's no money, mo problems out here
Oh you know, you know that everybody 
Everybody goin' through it, everybody goin' through it (x2)

Chorus 
It don't make no sense how it will always add up Nickels & Dimes

Break / Bridge 
Rent due, cell phone payment too
Rent due, car insurance too
Rent due now, health insurance too
Rent due now, car payment too

If I had anymore dollars / Dollars to my name 
That makes much easier / Makin' 8-10 per hour . Damn that shit insane
If I had anymore dollars / Dollars to my name
Oh na na Nickels & Dimes (x2)
Don't know how it works out / We just know that it does
Like Nickels & Dimes
Ah ooooooooo (Harmonize fade out)
