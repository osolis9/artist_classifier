Setting-Sun:Outasight
I hope this day is never done
I hope this day is never done
[Chorus:]
I hope this day is never done
No need to see the setting sun setting sun

Every day is another promise of the fresh start I have always wanted
Making myself a little better one step at a time putting down the glass
And picking up my mind I forgot about [?] temptation got a whole of a vrother
But he can't [?] stressing on the night living life on the town
I could be his light when the lights are coming down
So a little bit of day light long goes away used to control our mind
Going the wrong way I got enough living my occupation
Got a step up to the plate gets in upon the station
Are you [?] my patience is running real low as I am spitting out the bases
Try to make it home and even up the score my phone in the day is lost
And the sun goes on
[Chorus:]
I hope this day is never done
No need to see the setting sun setting sun

Every night is another battle between good and evil is someone in between
Fly under the radar minding my business at a sight got a vision must be a contradiction
What they put in our frame seems to be the difference
Between fiction and non fiction it was written
My own story and it's got a better ending like
Boy meets girl and time is suspending
Come and freeze [?] broken hearts get [?] at the end of the [?]
If nine times comes in thrills on my [?] you should be surprised
Of my own weak [?] another day another town is a sequel
When the sun starts to set you think we [?] I skip [?] cares
Tell you I wrote the song cause we are faire
[Chorus:]
I hope this day is never done
No need to see the setting sun setting sun

Tomorrow is another day
But what about this one right now
Lift it up the ground
Is it over now
Is it over now
[Chorus:]
I hope this day is never done
No need to see the setting sun setting sun
