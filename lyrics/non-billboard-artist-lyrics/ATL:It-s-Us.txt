It-s-Us:ATL
Yeah, it's real this time
(Anotha beat cox joint, uh)
There's nothin' in this world that's perfect ma'
You gotta understand that, y'knaw I mean?

If you gon' keep it real wit me, I think we gon' be right
You know, y'knaw I mean? But one thing you always
Gotta remember is how we started
It's both of us, we'll be straight dogg

We met each other through mutual friends
Since it sparked off, you my next ta kin
Is it your silky skin, ya' innocent grin
Or them curves and tha way that chu' been

Whatever it is
You got me glad that I took notice
When time's hopeless
Your words helped me stay focused

I was once told, never trust a diva
I usually toss 'em like the crust of a pizza
But now my sixth sense tell me ta keep her
We livin' lavida in our own world like cita

I'll let you sport mah chain, rock mah hat
Wear mah jersey, watch mah back
It took a lot for you to earn my trust
You wanna roll wit a boss? Then trust is a must
So lets skip all the fightin' and fuss, forget about them, it's us

Girl it's us, nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
Even if ya' girls ain't down for that
And even if the fellas ain't got my back
It's us, nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
No matter what they say we'll try
And even if the hate, we'll ride

They say you get what you pay for
That's why I'd rather pay more
And keep you in them wears, shorty's slice ya' face for
They get tha knock offs, you get the real Louis

That's one of the benefits of gettin' close to me
Down for three years ain't nuttin' come between
Experienced things you never thought you woulda' seen
I took you off the scene, sold you a dream

You bought that wit out no cream
We a match made, like George and Weezie
Lucy and Ricky, Ike and Tina, Bobby and Whitney
And if shit hit the fan, you comin' wit me
I won't take the stand, they gotta' come and get me

Ain't no limit to what I would do
'Cause true love strikes only one in a few
You might think it's too good to be true
But it ain't up to me, it's up to you
(Oh girl)

Girl it's us
(It's us)
Nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
(That's right, yeah)
Even if ya' girls ain't down for that
And even if the fellas ain't got my back
(It's me and you girl)

It's us, nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
(That's right)
No matter what they say we'll try
(Oh baby, listen to me)

And even if the hate, we'll ride
(Girl we got a good love
The kind that dreams are made of
And we're gonna keep it together
I'll be lovin' you forever)

Boy, I want you know, you make me so happy
I'll never leave your side, not for a minute
I'm in it to win it

No matter if they gossipin' out loud or whisperin'
Smile in our face but behind our backs snickerin'
And when we bickerin' they use that to tear us apart
It's obvious they got hate in they heart

I told you from the start, over here we livin' splendid
Amount that they make in a year, we get ta spend it
And we'll be movin' ahead when they finish
(Girl it's us)
I say these two words to you only 'cause I meant it, it's us

Girl, it's us
(That's right)
Nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
(Na na na na na na)
Even if ya' girls ain't down for that
And even if the fellas ain't got my back
(Always gonna love you girl)

It's us, nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
No matter what they say we'll try
(No matter)
And even if the hate, we'll ride
(Hate)

Girl it's us
(It's me and you)
Nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
(Nothing's gonna change it, baby)
Even if ya' girls ain't down for that
And even if the fellas ain't got mah back
(I'm gonna love you forever)

It's us, nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
No matter what they say we'll try
And even if they hate, we'll ride
(Ride)
Don't listen to the haters, baby
We'll always be together
