That-I-Do:Miguel
Step up to the plate
Like Sammy Sosa
Baby I can't wait to get to know you!
touching every base on my way home
Till we reach my place, and we're all alone
Yeah, yeah!

Uh, I know you like it baby
I know you like it, too
So come here closer
And do these words to rhyme

(I'm freaking) you're freaking
(I'm freaking) the way that I do!
(I'm freaking) watch me freaking 
(I'm freaking) the way that I do!
Uh uh uh!

Eight messages calling me...
they call me James ...
You're looking skeptical, so you will see
...for you is free!

Uh, I know you want it, babe 
Uh, I know you want it, too
Uh, so come here closer
Uh, I know just what I do, babe!

(I freak this) no one can freak this the way I freak this
The way that I do!
(I freak this) The way, the way, the way
(I freak this) The way that I do!
Uh, uh, uh no!
Break it down, break it down, come on!

Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie 
Nobody can freak this 
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie 
Nobody can freak this, the way that I do!
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie 
Uh, uh, uh no!
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Uh, uh, uh, uh
