Last-Letter:One Day as a Lion
[Zack de la Rocha]
Your God is a homeless assassin
Who roams the world to save
He's digging for buried treasures
He's leaving nothing but fields of graves
He's leaving nothing but fields of graves

[Hook]
And the tears will fly like birds of vengeance
And the sky will bury us all
And the church bells will sound like sirens shrieking
And the hole will be dug for the fall

[Zack de la Rocha]
Through the smoke it's now getting clearer
Who led us into the burning theater
Into the rain of bodies and ashes
And into the courtrooms of, of pitched blackness
Into the secret firing lines
Into the barbed wire, dug in around our minds
Dug in around our minds

[Hook]

[Zack de la Rocha]
Your God is dying much younger than Rome
He's killed so many he can't go home
Your God's heart is a tumor now rotten
Born of a blood that's never, that's never forgotten

And this is my, last letter to you
And this is my, last letter to you
And this is my, last letter to you
And this is my, last letter to you~!
I'm walking the belt way
And there's something I've got to do
There's something I've got to do
There's something I've got to do
