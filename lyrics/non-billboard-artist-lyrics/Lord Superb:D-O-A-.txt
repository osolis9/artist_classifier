D-O-A-:Lord Superb
[Intro: Lord Superb]
Beware, let's go, the muthafucka better mention my name, man
It's Perby Platinum, nigga, if a nigga ain't know, man
Now a nigga know the boss of fucking Far Rock is back in the building

[Jay-Z sample]
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin (the end)
Begin (the end) begin

[Lord Superb]
So ya'll wanna be rappers and actors
Muthafuckas make me laugh, to me ya'll practice
And Far Rock America, we all jackers
Stick up kids, yappers and snatchers
Bentley around the corner, I ain't talking bout Fonzworth
That's the kind of cars you get from hard work
My moms and pops dead, guess where my aunt work
I'm a Louis, Gucci nigga, you know what my scarf worth
We gotta shake it like Sam Walstein
The Benz look like a mirror, all the slippers is clean
Tell 'em, doggie for them diamonds, step right out
Hurry up, muthafucka, or get stretched right out
Right now, that's what I'm used to hearing
Real as Marion, I ain't used to caring
Yeah, I was close to caring
Before them forty caliber bullets roasted Karen
A gangsta's behind me, I ain't by myself
Piff pills and dust, all the liquor is top shelf
Fuck it, just label me nice
And say the chain have more karats than vegetable fried rice
That was me, that real muthafucker, that real OG
That boy that they call that S-U-P
E-R-B, ain't a nigga rob me, never
