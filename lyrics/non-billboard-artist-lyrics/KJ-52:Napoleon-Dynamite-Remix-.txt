Napoleon-Dynamite-Remix-:KJ-52
I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
I tried to grow a rat tail
And my jeans were kind of tight
I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
I did the running man
And I dressed like Vanilla Ice

I used to just chill at the bus stop
Just doing whatever I feel like I wanna do, gosh
I used to listen hip hop
Asked my friend, "Are you gonna eat all your tots?"
I used to ride my bike down a big hill
Fall off "sweet jumps" and be like "it kills"
And used to get dissed by the girls
Because, I didn't have any good skills

I was really good at tetherball
And ligers were pretty much my favorite animal
Brown suits are awesome, incredible
Quesadillas are really very edible
Vote for KJ, he's elect-able
Tina, eat your ham, it's not a vegetable
Rex Kwon Do is really very wonderful
And that's why I keep telling y'all

I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
People said I couldn't rap cuz my skin was white
I used to have hair like Napoleon Dynamite
But since I got Jesus now I know it's gonna be alright
