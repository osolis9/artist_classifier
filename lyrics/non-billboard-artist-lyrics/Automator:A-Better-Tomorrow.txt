Break it down

This is the year to make money and be chilling
This is the year to make money and be chilling

Break it down

This is the year to make money and be ch-ch-chilling
This is the year to make money and be chilling

Sort of break it down like this

Yes, as we pass
Through the interludes
The J A Z Z session, continues
One, two, rock, lyrics

I get rough make raps collide rough, they stick together
Like Run-D.M.C. pumping up, 'Tougher Than Leather'
Vertical sideways, earthquakes'll shake them highways
Technics spin rotate, the red lights illustrate

Like groupies on Shaquille, so swift like Ron O'Neal
While Freddie remains dead
With speakers pumping in his head
More wild than Gorefest, growl
