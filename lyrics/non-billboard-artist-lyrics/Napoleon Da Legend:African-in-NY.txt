African-in-NY:Napoleon Da Legend
Verse 1:
Don’t rock sandals I rock Timberlands/ wear a skully to the side
You can see it in the motions when I walk/ I’m an African in New York
See me cruising down the FDR/ With a Dime Piece in the ride
You can hear it when I talk/ I’m an Africa in New York

Chorus
Ohh Ohh – I’m an alien an illegal alien/ I’m an African in New York
Ohh Ohh – I’m an alien and my name’s Napoleon/ I’m an African in New York

Verse 2:
From the village to the streets/ from feeling the heat/ to feeling chills down my spine from the winter breeze/ trynna make my money stretch like a centipede/ and leave a legacy longer than the Kennedy’s/ I need a green card without the legal fees/ my Senegalese connects said he can get it for me legally/ my cousin wired me money to buy him jeans/ trynna figure out how to get a bank account without an ID/ damn things work differently here/ diamonds come out the ground they get it from Tiffany’s here/ and when you’re down and out/ you don’t get no sympathy here/ got a melody in my head like an epiphany here/ man/ I make a penny double/ I make a dime triple/ quadrupling a quarter I’m a man of many hustles/ I’m making solid connects for the dollars and cents/ so when you meet the God Acknowledge and respect

Chorus

Verse 3:
Money makes the man as someone said/ so we hustle to get paid
Takes a man to sacrifice for years and smile/ be yourself no matter what they say
Be yourself no matter what they say/ be yourself no matter what they say
It’s like this yall/ For my brothers on the block/ from the gutter to the top
Know we keeping our pockets flooded to the top/ keep our brains sharp from hustling a lot/ open up shop anywhere customers will flock
