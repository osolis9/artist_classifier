We Can Make It
(nicky graham)

Roger
I know we can make it, i know we can make it
I've been waiting for a girl like you to come my way
I've been waiting for a girl to shine some light on my days
I've been searching for that someone who could understand me
Someone who's not afraid to laugh or cry and share that with me

Girl
I've been waiting for a boy like you to hold my hand
I've been waiting for a boy like you to give me a chance
And i've been longing for that feeling of being complete
You have shown me just how good love is when two minds meet
I know i know i know

Chorus
Cr: we can make it if we try, we can make it you and i
We can ...
Girl: we can make it if we try
Cr: we can ...
Girl: a love like ours can't be denied
Cr: we can make it if we try, if we believe in you and i
We can ...
Girl: we can make it if we try
Cr: we can ...
Girl: a love like ours can't be denied

Girl
Could you be the kind to love unconditionally
Lee
Could you be the kind to overlook the faults in me
Girl & lee
We don't have to last forever just for the rest of our lifetime
If you're feeling what i'm feeling,
Then this is the right time ...

Chorus

Phil
Well i guess that it was worth the waiting
Cos now you see what you mean to me
Girl
Well this time there'll be no hesitating
If i was blind, i'd still see you as mine
Phil & girl
Oh oh ... oh baby yeah
Cos i know ...
Phil
I know that we can make it ... yeah ...

Cr: we can make it if we try, if we believe in you and i
