Lights-Out-Tepr-Emo-Remix-:Santigold 
Lights out, shoot up the station
TV's dead, where's there to run?
Watch everybody come undone

Lights out, we'll make it easy, we'll make it fun
Won't let them see now, how they had won
Still I wait another round

Darling
Don't got to worry, you're locked in tight
Darling
Don't got to worry, turn out the light

Wiped out, no concentration
They got us basking in the storm
I watch it as it loses form

I doubt, they could see me; that's what I want
A casualty, but I am upfront
And I know what it's about

Darling
Don't got to worry, you're locked in tight
Darling
Don't got to worry, turn out the light

I'm still a-shakin' my head
The one you can't account for
I keep just one step ahead
There's no place to run

Darling
Don't got to worry, you're locked in tight
Darling
Don't got to worry, turn out the light

Aah ah ah ah ah...

Darling
Don't got to worry, you're locked in tight
Darling
Don't got to worry, turn out the light

Darling
Don't got to worry, you're locked in tight
Darling
Don't got to worry, turn out the light

Aah aah ah ah ah ah...
