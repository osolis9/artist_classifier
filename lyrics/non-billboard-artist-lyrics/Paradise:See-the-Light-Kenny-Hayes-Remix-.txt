See-the-Light-Kenny-Hayes-Remix-:Paradise
and is nowere for my spirit to go
see the light taht burns inside of you
and I know could I be close to you
Into the darkness we can fly
Above the wings of your desire
I see the light
We flew for all the course of love
With you i just can get enough
I see the light
Into the darkness we can fly
Above the wings of your desire
I see the light
We flew for all the course of love
With you i just can get enough
I see the light
See the light
I see the light
I see the light
In your eyes I see your broken soul
and is nowere for my spirit to go
see the light taht burns inside of you
and I know could I be close to you
Into the darkness we can fly
Above the wings of your desire
I see the light
We flew for all the course of love
With you i just can get enough
I see the light
See the light
I see the light
I see the light
