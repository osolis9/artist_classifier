Freestyle:Boo and Gotti
Yo Boo, Irv Gotti, Black and BJ outta wait the fuck up here man
Shit done hit the fan, let's do dis shit man, fo real
Let's do it, what the fuck there ain't nuthin' else to be said

Yo, I got a empire with niggas with thug in they blood
I admire dem niggas, My desire is figgas
Rockland bitch, why hire some killas?
Gotti heat like hail son and fire dem niggas

Pop off to clips, top off new six
Rock frost blue wrist, still cop two bricks
Cook crack in the pot, push pats on the block
Cock the glock, pop up like jack in a box

He crazy insane, mommy's say loco
I even push Caine when the blow is slow
And when the dough got low, I got the high 'fo
Back in the same hood on the block for 'mo

Doorags, saggin' pants, I'm baggin' grams
Niggas smokin' the joke and den laughin' at
"What if I get to blast a man?"
Aw shit, Boo watch out

Oh shit, you capped dat nigga yo

You think I just got nice?
Well, I been at niggas throats till it even got worse
And I got Hennessey and coke in my system
Hot chicks, I fuck 'em and diss 'em
I'm out to cop bricks, cut 'em and split 'em

Put plenty in the bag, 20s on the jag
I'm a big faced getter, you get panties and brag
Fo fo too heavy so I'm bustin' the sag
Slow dough, that's petty, I ain't fuckin' wit' dat

It's fo real when I spit these bars
And cats like, "Damn, how dis lil' nigga get new cars?"
Stay high all day run around with thugs flippin' pies all day
Rockland nigga, so you better make way 'cuz we comin' for niggas
Got guns? We ain't runnin' from niggas, I know you heard dat

My real bitches
Sometimes I'm less than a bitch, never trustin' a bitch
I'd rather get head than be fuckin' a bitch
And it ain't nuthin' different, that's the way we roll
It be them lame ass niggas given dough to hoes

Before I pay for a brick, she taste da shit
Put her back on a bus wit' it taped to her hips
All my mommy's rock Gucci
If we in the whip, put the dope in her koochie

All my chicks like Snoopy
I like dyke's dat like dyke's but I don't like groupies
I use to like tootsie and dat's a fact for ya life
I got chicks dat smoke, some roll dice
Others like to fight but they all love ice

Hip hop niggas, they all thugs right?
Na, get dropped nigga, betta get plugged right
Boo and Gotti true pimps, Rockland for life
Get it right

Rockland
For life nigga
Boo and Gotti
