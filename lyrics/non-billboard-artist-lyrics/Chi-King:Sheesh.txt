Sheesh:Chi-King
It's what we trained to do
Squad

These niggas vagina, my gunhole vagina
Let a nigga chop a thot on nobody
Pistol her hair, bullet her linin'
Should be in New York, I feel like a giant
I grew up in Dallas,?
You should be sorry, young killaz get violent
Shoes only ridin', lookin' for ops to ride on
See them niggas and get on shit that they not on
I'm the shit, King Throne with a but on it
Hear 'em talkin' but they not on it
I weigh like an elephant
For bitches who sellin' it, smokin' on president
Thickin' on chickens, I'm sippin' on medicine
Watzon, a Maseratti, I do it for etiquette
I'm a god, gold wings cause I'm heaven sent
Ride around on that whateva shit
Shawty shootin' like a restaurant
Only fuck a bad bitch once
Shawty went cause of the restaurant
Yung nigga upper echelon
Executor, heath the evidence
Purple hearted, I'm a veteran
Lou Gatti and the way I party and the bad lady dress elegant
Down on the regular, not just to celebrate
Kill a fuck nigga, get away and celebrate
Wooo!

Hurry the murder rate
Blunt on my money, my money - yo momma
Bodies, they come to us all the time
Fuck around with the fuck around bitch
We don't fuck around, send 'em outside
All shawties they do it fo' me
Ah, this money, you do it fo' me
Movin' 100, that's me
Flexin', I'm juggin', I'm ballin'
All of these thotties they call me
Roll up on 'em, ride down so it's ride fo' women
Drug dealers, crackers, robbers, killaz they my niggas
I don' ... call it with my niggas, they demonic
30s on the 40s where the squad is
Stones and the chains and the watch
Bitch, gimme top
Tell ya girlfriend gimme bottle
Different on the satellite like Harlem to a spider
Muthafucka lookin' like a spider
200 when I hit the throttle
Man, I'm a man, I'm 100 again
