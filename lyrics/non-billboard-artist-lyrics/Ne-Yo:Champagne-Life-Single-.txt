Champagne-Life-Single-:Ne-Yo
[Intro:]
Yes, it's a beautiful day*
It's gone be a beautiful night
Break out the champagne
Everybody get a glass
Let's start it off sexy
What do you say

Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh)
Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh)
Think I like that
Uh, and all the ladies say (Uh-huh)

Welcome to champagne life
Where trouble is a bubble in a champagne glass
Dreams and reality are one and the same
And we gone do it like this (Oh)

[Verse 1:]
Got an addiction for life in this living
Like everyday's my birthday, I know what I'm getting
And reserved for time 'cause that's where I'm sitting
Me and my friends and found 6 Miss Independents (Independents)
And my attitudes so chilled and so breezy (breezy)
My design is suit, I make this look easy (easy)
Sexy baby, don't you dare act like you don't see me
Baby, I know you see me

[Chorus:]
It's all about them, fast car nights and them big wheel days
Living the champagne life, everything's okay
Let's toast it up (Oh)
Let's toast it up (Oh)

Said we play all night and we play all day
Living the champagne life, everything's okay
Let's toast it up (Oh)
Baby, let's toast it up (Oh)
Champagne life

[Verse 2:]
Got bent out property on cloud nine (Oh)
I got the sun jealous 'cause the way I shine (Oh)
And reserved for time 'cause that's how I do mine
Nice meal and a good wine, definition of a good time (time)
Living out my dreams, watching them come true (come true)
Baby, I'm the boss, I don't know what they do (they do)
You've put down the ride, come on and I'll take you
I know you want me to take you

[Chorus:]
So if it's all about them, fast car nights and them big wheel days
Living the champagne life and everything's okay
Let's toast it up (Oh)
Everybody, let's toast it up (Whoo)

Said because we play all night and we play all day
Living the champagne life and everything's okay
Let's toast it up (Oh)
Baby, let's toast it up (Oh)
Champagne life

[Talking: Ne-Yo]
Uh, uh, hey, uh (Uh-huh)
We don't clap the same when we living that champagne life

Oh, it's a party, reserved for top notch

[Chorus:]
Oh, said it's all about them, fast car nights and them big wheel days
Living the champagne life and everything's okay
