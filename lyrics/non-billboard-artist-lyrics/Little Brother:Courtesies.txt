Courtesies:Little Brother
This morning's blessing come and gone 
we never knew we'd laugh so long 
carried away by careless calls 
I write to kick the corners out 
unfolding rolls of rusty rail 
pleased to perceive another song 

If you had time you could reciprocate 
all the courtesies set your way 
everyone's around everyone's surrounded 
in all the worst ways 

With interest your address was slowly condemned 
and adverts continued to empty your hands 
in spite of the smallest picture I was lonely 
Your sister confronted an endless wall, 
but struggled to climb in alone 
do I need to come around
