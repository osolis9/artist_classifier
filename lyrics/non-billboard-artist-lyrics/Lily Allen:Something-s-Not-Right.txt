Something-s-Not-Right:Lily Allen
Something's not right
Something's not right

We had forever
We never got it together
I waited for you
For you I made it better
They kept telling me that it was unlikely
All I had to do was keep you beside me

Something's not right
There aren't many stars in the sky tonight
Something's not right
There's another mistake but it's dark outside
And I feel a weight in my heart tonight

We had forever
We never got it together
I waited for you
For you I made it better
They kept telling me that it was unlikely
All I had to do was keep you beside me

Something's not right
There aren't many stars in the sky tonight
Something's not right
There's another mistake but it's dark outside
Like the feeling of rain on a Summer light

O-o-o-o-o-oh
A-a-a-a-a-ah
Mmmm
