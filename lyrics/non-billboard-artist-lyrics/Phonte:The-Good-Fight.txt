The-Good-Fight:Phonte
Up early with the sun and the stars
Six a.m. ringing .. weather man says is .. day
...under the jar said .. had a meeting for about 3 hundred
.. see it coming i always knew that one day they will find
.. i was thinking why you .. ass niggers .. the light at the end of the tunnel
Is a game five hour dollars .. cause everybody has to do a job that hey hate
.. sell out when nobody is selling .. take your money take your money
Hustle hard .. your cause whenever you are .. just wanna get it

Just wanna get a taste struggle between .. baby ... rap the fuck of me
.. i am like .. this shit don’t come with blue prints . ..i tell my people i ain’t rich
.. go for your dreams that’s what they are telling ... nobody is selling
Try to fight a good fight but .. take your money take your money
.. sell out when nobody is selling .. take your money take your money
