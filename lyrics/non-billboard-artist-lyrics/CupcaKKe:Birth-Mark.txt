Birth-Mark:CupcaKKe
Couldn't get no sleep last night (not at all)
Throwing up like I'm dizzy from a flight (I'm sick as fuck)
Mom bugging for nothing, she so uptight
She said, "it gotta go if you staying here for the night"
"It's important, abort it," that's what they all said
Rubbing my stomach to feel it, don't wanna kill it, thats dead
Will I still go to heaven? Will I still get my blessings?
When I leave the doctor's office, would I feel like a felon?
I'm kinda aggy, shame I got a fucked up babydaddy
Would of been a good mother to love her
Till I'm wrinkled and saggy
Like a test, I'm stressed and hella naggy
Cause this shit cut deep like it stab me
The nurse under my skirt looking for the body parts
This vacuum hurt, I just hope it don't leave scars
In the mirror, I'm staring I'm so embarrassed
Feel like my soul selling quicker than clothes up on the fucking clearance

Wish I would of borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life just like a birth mark (birth mark)
Wish I would of borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life just like a birth mark (birth mark)

Can't buy no baby clothes, can't feed her SpaghettiOs
Can't squeeze her fat cheeks, or kiss her baby rolls
Clean her toes even when it's gross
Can't be there when she grow up receive her first rose
From her first crush, or buy her first clutch
But instead I'm in the hospital bed and doing no such
Yeah, that nigga fucked me, but he dont give no fuck
So much baby weight, I can't even do a toe-touch
Made this decision 'cause I'm not ready
On minimum wage and ain't no gas in the Chevy (I need help)
My family and friends shame me, ain't that petty?
Got me sleeping with one eye open like I'm Fetty
Cause at the moment they can't stand me (gave up)
Didn't wanna have it by a deadbeat (I didn't)
Damn, if only I had a plan B
My baby father only offered me a Plan B (fucked up)

Wish I would of borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life just like a birth mark (birth mark)
Wish I would of borned you on this Earth (Lord knows)
I'm not alive inside, I feel the worst (Lord knows)
I'm torn about my unborn and it hurts hard (hurts hard)
Now I'm scarred for life just like a birth mark (birth mark)
