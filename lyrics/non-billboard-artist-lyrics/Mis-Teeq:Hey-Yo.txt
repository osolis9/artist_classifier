Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go
Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go

When we started digging
When we started chilling
Used to be, want to be, everywhere with me
Told your boys get off your back
Told 'em it was like that
Told my girls where I'm at
Hanging with my man
But what's up with you
Lately I can't trust you
I don't know where you go
I don't know what you do
Why must I ask myself why
That you're not telling lies

Telling me, telling me
That you're playing by the rules
If you're playing by the rules would I feel the way I do
Telling me, telling me
That your promises are true
If your promises are true then I'm coming to find you
Where were you, where were you
When I called you
Cos back in the day, you always came through
Why do you, why do you
When I ask you 
You act like you've got something to prove

Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go
Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go

Hey yo
Hey yo
Hey yo
Hey

Where you go, coming to my place
Where you at when you show up late
Could it be that you were with what's her name
When you say you're with the fellas
I couldn't be anything you see
Cos it never used to be this way
So look into my eyes if you're not telling lies

Telling me, telling me
That you're playing by the rules
If you're playing by the rules would I feel the way I do
Telling me, telling me
That your promises are true
If your promises are true then I'm coming to find you
Where were you, where were you
When I called you
Cos back in the day, you always came through
Why do you, why do you
When I ask you 
You act like you've got something to prove

Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know baby
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go
Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go

Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why you lie
Why you act like something ain't right
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why you lie
Why you act like something ain't right
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why you lie
Why you act like something ain't right
Tell me why you gotta hide
Tell me why gotta hide
You ain't doing something right
Come on baby tell me why

I said
Hey yo, we coming with a new flow
Rishi Rich adding this to the streets
We looking forward, got an album to complete
More room to grow and more beats to feed
So take the heat off the track in the stereo
Coming throught your speakers
Meet Mis-Teeq like you're the mystique cos
This is a battle of the fittest
With God as my witness
There's only one way to pass me the quickness
You're so delicious
I'm gonna whip this
In big black jeans I'm gonna hit this
Coming through the air like the degrees
I can see, it's me, and Mis-Teeq and Rishi
Taking over the industry
So you can see an MC like me
All those who had the courage to say to me
This is how it's gonna be yo

Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go
Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go

Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?
Like I don't know
What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go
Hey Yo
Why you gotta tip-toe
Why you hot yo?

What are you saying so?
I can stay or I can go
Mis-Teeq in the place yo
