Warriors:Royce Da 5'9" 
America's worst nightmare ahead by light years
Hip hop's only shining star in the night's air
Right here, don't fight fair, what I write, yeah
Might there, throw 'em off like they Bobby Knight's chair

I been where you tryin' to be, I'm already hot
All about cake, Betty Crock' and spit ready rock
They know my bar came venom in a bezzie rock
Kicked from fight club, outfit from Eddie Brock

I'm goin for the kill, focused on a steady plot
John Wilkes the Booth like when he dead aimed his nezzie shot
You listenin' to hip hop's finest
You rewind this, Slaughterhouse behind this

I like rap, this shit is cool, I'm better than mad niggaz
But I'm just as good a crack pitcher as a pad ripper
I say that to say this don't let mad liquor
Turn me to a body bag zipper and not a ad libber

Couple joints ago I was right on that ave with ya
Mad bigger than the cats David Tyree had last winter
I'm not a made up character that's a Puerto Rican Brooklynite
With two kids y'all see in them mag pictures

And however I gotta feed 'em I will
All they ever gon' need in life is just, me and my will
Interfere with that it's gon' be more than a beat that I kill
Disrespect with an indirect and you will see if I'm real

Fuck you blood suckin' parasites
I'm bringin' the terror right in front of your parent's sight
You parents' eyes and yeah, I wear a pair of pipes
I wear 'em like Sega like on a pair of thighs

I'm Eric Wright, I'm 'Ruthless', I terrorize
You'll either perish or be paralyzed, I'm a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
I'm even keepin' them heaters when we perform
On stage rockin' like we from Korn, the people roar

What they don't know it's a secret war
Inside of a rider I'm seekin' revenge on the world for bein' born
And the desert eagle is mi amor
She'll fuck you to death, blow your brains, either or 'cause she a whore

Allow me to reassure your stripe's worthless
Like a pair of Diadora's when it leaves the Adidas store
Don't be comparin' us to rappers
Compare us to the Arabs, this a terrorist attack

Lord have mercy, we here to destroy everything
You niggaz is butter in front a fuckin' machete swing
Motherfucker I'm fly, I ain't no scary goon
Try me and I guarantee you I'mma see you very soon

Leave a nigga ass out like Prince, take his bitch
Put my 'Graffiti Bridge' right 'Under Her Cherry Moon'
We notorious, pushin' them Porsches
Y'all niggaz the orphans us, we the warriors

This rap shit is a workout on my legs, a nigga goin' hard on his bike
But two million dudes is jumpin' on the pegs
They know when that raw shit get recorded
Either let your speakers enforce it or lay down in a mosh pit

Of course it's the bosses, actin' like officers
Runnin' in these corporate offices
Hungry lookin' for a four course dish no matter what the cost is
Like the world's lawless so we don't know what remorse is

'Cause the V need like a thousand horses
Slaughterhouse hoodie on, that's my new couture shit
It's jump off he be the best
Computers rank me number 1, blame the BCS
It's they fault nigga

Ask about your boy, I'm nice with my hands
Maybe that's why, every last thing I write is a jam
Minus the fans, the flights to Japan, I am the man
Anyone who feel they could see me is in dire need of a eye exam

My mind expands wider than the fan base of a fire band
And what I release from my diaphragm
Sticks to you, like the wrists of Spider-Man
Fool a average listeners what you liars can do but you will die a scam

When I die they will retire my entire hand
For years of scripted whoop ass, makin' intruders try a can
I guess the moral of the story is Joell's victorious
And everything's all gravy like Notorious

I left a nigga dead 'cause he said he was ready for I
Let the Beretta give him wings since he said he was fly
I'm in my Chevy ridin' to 'Bar Exam' and 'Mood Muzik'
They the closest to 'Reasonable Doubt' and 'Ready to Die'

Crooked I, watch for snitches and wire devices
My Fo'-fifth, fire in crisis, lift you higher than prices
All my ice and on the mic I am the nicest
Me and my bitch ride for life like Osirus and Isis

Yeah, word to Run-D.M.C. I'm 'Tougher Than Leather' face
Never threw a gun in the trash but they call me 'Weapon Waist'
It's like you movin' from the projects to the Hamptons
The way my hammers be sendin' bastards to a better place

Let me set it straight, they fans been led astray
Niggaz keep gassin' with guns with unleaded spray
They don't know they one flow, one medic away
From bein' taken away from here in the leaded state

I handle all of my serious issues with metal
I stick you so deep in the earth your zipper can tickle the devil
I'm skippin' the pick and the shovel, I'm pickin' you up
And I'm shovin' your head in the mud until your kickings is level

Pardon I live for the moment, you rhymin' I give the atonement
Like the Indians, I scalp and I wig the opponent
But I'm a chief, matter of fact I'm a beast
I'm a motherfuckin' Slaughterhouse G, boom
