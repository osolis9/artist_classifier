Deep-Down-feat-Caan-:Frankee
[Verse: Caan]
The answer you gave
Left me out in the dark
Some people enter your life as a blessing
While some leave a lesson that lasts
But I hold that something in my arms
I can hold in my arms

[Pre-Chorus: Caan]
If I can't understand your silence
How will I understand your words?
I just need a bit of guidance
So let me into your world

[Chorus: Caan]
Baby
Can you tell me what it's like? I just wanna know
How you feel inside, I've been tryna read the signs
That's in between the lines, I just wanna know
How you feel inside, deep down inside
I wanna know what it's like
How you feel inside, deep down inside
I wanna know what it's like

[Post-Chorus: Caan]
I wanna know what it's like to feel emotions
I wanna know what it's like to feel emotion for you
I wanna know what it's like to feel emotions
I wanna know what it's like to feel emotion for you
I wanna know what it's like
I wanna know what it's like
I wanna know what it's like
I wanna know what it's like

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus] + [Post-Chorus]
