It-s-the-Weekend:Lil' J
Rock wit me now
Dance wit me now
Move wit me now
It's the weekend, c'mon

Aiiyo, I heard the party packed from the front to the back
We gon' tear the roof off, make the floor collapse
Jump out the Porsche, candy-gloss, hunchback
Slid right in, gave security dap

They know who I be don' need no ID
I'm either on the dance floor, or VIP
I stack that cheese, at club 112 lurkin'
Sippin' on virgin daquiris

That's me, J, I'm the one
Besides lookin' quiet why don' you slide here hun
Let your hair down lets have some fun
It's the weekend, and the party just begun

To the windows, to the walls
The club is packed so that's all
See my girls and all my doggs
Won't leave till the window's fog

It's the weekend, what you doin'?
Get out the house, wanna see you movin'
Gotta get your money right 'cuz it's on tonight
Yeah, it's the weekend, baby

Aiiyo, Jermaine you should see the way I'm gamin' these dames
I'ma soldier, my boy, six Rovers stay in your lane
Chicks get whippa peeled how I grip the wheel
So fast get whiplash, when the wheels peel

I'm so ghetto but the broads still love me
I never fall off my game, never rusty
J make the girls stop and stare
The way the chains swing back and forth like a rockin' chair

It's hot in here, why does the jungle
Why does the rumbles in the tunnel
Let's pop in here, from 80 to Club Centuries to the good bar
Everybody know Lil' J the Hollywood star

To the windows, to the walls
The club is packed so that's all
See my girls and all my doggs
Won't leave till the window's fog

It's the weekend, what you doin'?
Get out the house, wanna see you movin'
Gotta get your money right 'cuz it's on tonight
Yeah, it's the weekend, baby

When I'm in ATL I'm with JD and them
Da Brat, Bow Wow, JE and them
Westcoast, I'm with Big Snoop and them
Doc Dre, LT, in the coupe with them

In New York, you know I'm with Roc-a-fella
Jay-Z, Beanie, and Bleek in the drop together
When I'm in the Midwest I'm with R. Kelly and them
Rockland, St. Lunatics, Nelly and them

To the windows, to the walls
The club is packed so that's all
See my girls and all my doggs
Won't leave till the window's fog

It's the weekend, what you doin'?
Get out the house, wanna see you movin'
Gotta get your money right 'cuz it's on tonight
Yeah, it's the weekend, baby

To the windows, to the walls
The club is packed so that's all
See my girls and all my doggs
Won't leave till the window's fog

It's the weekend, what you doin'?
Get out the house, wanna see you movin'
Gotta get your money right 'cuz it's on tonight
Yeah, it's the weekend, baby, it's the weekend
