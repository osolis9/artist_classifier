Phat-Beach-I-ll-Be-Ready-:Naughty Boy
Some people stand in the darkness
Afraid to step into the light
Some people need to help somebody
When the edge of surrender's in sight.

Don't you worry!
Its gonna be alright
'cause I'm always ready,
I won't let you out of my sight.

I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here.

In us we all have the power
But sometimes its so hard to see
And instinct is stronger than reason
It's just human nature to me.

Don't you worry!
Its gonna be alright
'cause I'm always ready,
I won't let you out of my sight.

I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here.

'Cause I'm always ready
I won't let you out of my sight!
I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)

I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here.
Forever and always
I'm always here.
