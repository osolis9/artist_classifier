The-Utopian-Suntan:Dice
On the edge of a lonesome dream, martini glass upfront
Smoking big cigar framed by thousand rose...
Set my mind back in 97, I thought I was in heaven
Living hell on wheels
Make it thru the day...

Dirty mirrors and this eyeliner, let it fade away later with a story...
Of a lonely king...
Mama's boy treated me like a stranger
Don't let this daddy-o put your life in danger...
Shall we dance for a while...

The sun is set quietly, butterflies they came out of the dark...
We fly and reach for the stars, I could never lie...
The million years millionaires
How they died over diamonds and pearls...
But I'll see death when butterflies trapped me inside this...
Sunset and butterflies trapped me insane!

Dirty mirrors and this eyeliner, let it fade away later with a story...
Of a lonely queen...
I'll play my guitar now with blood and tears yeah
Try to get some hot bad chicano swing...
Under this red red sky...
