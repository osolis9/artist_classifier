Too-Long:1982
Statik Selektah & Termanology
2 x Chorus:
I don t waited too long now is straight to the top
And holding my breath for too long
Gotta make it to heaven I ain t been through hell
been holding the stress for too long
I sleep two hour incraments, I flee from deadly incidence
Me and my click was sipping devil in the bricks
My life was under .the guns and violence
And . I know I m higher I m flying but leaves the .
Nobody s home I m all alone and in the zone I feel it making all alone
These palms you know
I m like a lost profit and nuts get off topic but I got enough skeletin to feel a large closet
I ain t the goon or killer or murderer but I kill beast and rapers and all was murder em
My perspective on collecting money from reckless money is get the check
But check for detectives in this .she lexus
Tryin to rest and check us for weapons and let the spencers
But they stay .protect against sense the essence
I ride my rhymes with the complexness
So my car in this fresh cause the senseness so waste the bar .
2 x Chorus:
I don t waited too long now is straight to the top
And holding my breath for too long
Gotta make it to heaven I ain t been through hell
been holding the stress for too long
all my way to heaven and been time my . the ashes the .
and passes with the traffic I stay sipping the plastic cups to that liquor serving

sneak in the ham with me
in the trunk getting drunk ain t need it but it was with me,
if I needed I was ready to squeeze it and just please the fifth
but I got two six .and that loyalty is a bitch
I love my freedom too much to get the key up
To a piece of shit I make me feel a P cup
And the re-up we so fire I m .turn the block multi lava the way you hit up
I m on my way to heaven but I can t escape the devil in the ghetto girls
Put the .inside of jellow
I change my metal for making .and staying band to making .and instrumentals
[2x Chorus:]
Third grade couldn t go to school for whole week
Pop dudes beat me down left marks on my seat
They wanna caught the police but me I let it go
I told em no I love my pops I let it show my crib
Got shot up the first time when I was 8 should ve seen my face
I knew trouble was on the way and my aunt was prostitute
Hooking every day crazy pens look me in my eyes and show me the way
Punch a bitch in the eye only way she gonna pay
Leave a stich break a bone only wasy she gonna stay
This my real life y all rappers making my sheet up
My baby set te smoke back crack and stay lead up
Eyes all bugged out people like black pennies crack his step mama
Shut up to jenny and not to put my business all in my written shit
