The-Victim:Minus
So let me out, oh, let me out, I just cant be here anymore
I feel the cold, I feel the cold, my heart is freezing over now
I need some help, I need some help, I need a helping hand fore sure
You are the one, you are the one, I dont need anybody else

I'm living in my delusions There are no simple solutions
I gotta dig my own way out of the ground

Longing for your touch, I'm wanting you too much,
I'm needing you too much, Cant ever get enough
I'm drowning, I am lost here - tell me what to do
The Sun may burn itself to Hell,
the Moon just like a shell may shatter in my hand
I'll never understand
I'm drowning, I am lost here - tell me what to do
