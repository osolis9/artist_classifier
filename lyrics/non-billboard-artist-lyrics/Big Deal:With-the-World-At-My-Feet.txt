With-the-World-At-My-Feet:Big Deal
With the world at my feet
And the stars in my reach
But you won't be with me
With the world at my feet
And the stars in my reach
But you won't be with me
You won't be with me

I was waiting for you
Was waiting
I was sleeping
You've been changing

You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know
You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know

With the world at my feet
And the stars in my reach
But you won't be with me
You won't be with me

All that I need
But all that I need
Won't be with me
Won't be with me

Tired of giving, of forgiving
Some mistakes are not worth saving

You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know
You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know

You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know
You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know
You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know
You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know
You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know
You don't have to say it's done
I know, I know

With the world at my feet
And the stars in my reach
But you won't be with me
You won't be with me
