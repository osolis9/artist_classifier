Surrender:Sun Rise Above 
Don't give up on me please, you didn't leave when they had the cuffs on me
Threw me behind bars mind scarred shedding tears
But never fear, forever here, seven years
Punch drunk love like I chugged several beers
Heavens here between us in the midst of hell
The mistake would be colossal if we let this fail
Forget the gale force winds pounding on our shack
Just stick together, regroup and then we'll pound them back
Counter attack, and I'll always be found at your back
Whenever you need it, repeat it like the sound of a gat
Down to exacts, I'm lacking and far from perfect
Out of work, and you hurt when you don't deserve it
Those worthless parasites living off you, but you ain't scared to fight
Prepare for flight 'cause you ain't scared of heights
I swear I might love you more than I love freedom
Let's get them both so we don't have to choose either

It's been a long time, we're still slaving for wages
And when we stand up pigs still caving our brains in
Amazing resistance, maintain persistence
Never give up 'cause it can change in an instance
A hundred years in one day pass, could be Sunday
Or someday after that, glorious aftermath
Until then continue building
Another day another brick in the wall, gets kicked til it falls
It all comes tumbling, stomach grumbling no more
The hungry feed, all of our wants and needs, all can at once proceed
Finally freed from the bondage, no longer held hostage
Imagine, a human community based on unity
No more immunity for corporate criminals that screwing we
It's soon to be real, and then we can heal
Destroy and rebuild
