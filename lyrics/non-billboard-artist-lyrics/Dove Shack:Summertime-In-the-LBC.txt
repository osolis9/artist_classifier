To kick it in my town

Summertime in The LBC
Oohhhhh ahhhhh
Summertime in The LBC

Now me and my girls are deep
In a '94 Wrangler jeep
Flow so long thru Long Beach
Daisy Dukes gets props
Hair and nails fresh from the shop
And we're at the bombest spot
Called the shackkk

Three months of pleasure
How can I measure
The relaxation
All the fun I'm facin
My homies got green
That's them
For show 'do
Hit the sto' 'do
So I can get a 40
My lil' cousin rushin to the park too much
Standin in line tah get a free lunch
Why do we do what we do when we do what we do
Hangin out late wit no curfew

Damn, it's hot than a mutha
I'm smuthareen ribs wit barbacue sauce
Fools get tossed if they reach across my barbacue grill
So continue tah chill
At King's park in the LBC
That's where ya'll find me
Hangin wit my homies and my friends
We got the coke in hand
We got Da Five Footaz and the Twinz
We got Warren G and the D-O-G
All come around
Tah hear the Dove Shack G Funk sound
