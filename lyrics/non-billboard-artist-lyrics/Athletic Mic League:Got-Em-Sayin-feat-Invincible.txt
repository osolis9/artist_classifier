Got-Em-Sayin-feat-Invincible:Athletic Mic League
Free from the doldrums, you are finally
If you need something wholesome, please let us know, we
Feed your compulsion at any time of need
So you leave with emotions above stepping stones

So, turn it up, turn it up, crank it up, crank it up
How we make it sound?
Like we in an insane asylum
When we, turn it up, turn it up, crank it up, crank it up
We A-M-L-evatin' the game, we came in wilin'

Excuse me if I rhyme with a little upliftness
I'm from the Deuce

3 AM, still banging my beats, who's complaining?
No landlord, or note on the door

I swear I heard them noises coming from them cats up under me


We got 'em going
And then they like
The whole crowd saying
Ay yo, I got 'em going

Michigan, it ain't loud enough


Black boy, black boy, turn that ish down
You know that America don't wanna hear the sound
Of the subwoof, tweeters and amplifiers crying freedom

Thinking that they confining me
Writing me tickets
Guess what?

So

On the count of three

Scream "turn it up", on three



You know I got 'em saying, 'Shut Up Buff'







TURN IT BACK UP!
