Dune-Stalker:Rondo Brothers
fibers blow in the eastern wind
spread through the will of the people within
inhabitants are in for the shock of their lives
when the predator flies tonight

microwave antenna with the TV eye
video shoots as the wicked drive by
gps is tracking from an eight mile high
and the company drones are flyin

chemical skies hang gray to red
funeral procession to the field of the dead
word goes out through the kids in the town
better stay inside when the hit comes down

a figure in the shadow of a low hallway
papers and a package more than two years pay
translator listens on a closed circuit line to the voice of the mastermind
and it's time

(time time time...)
Waitin for the rain to drop
(time time time...)
waitin for the rain to drop
(time time time.)
waitin for the rain to drop.
(time time time.)
no better friend, no worse enemy

gear wheels grind in the red hot sand
dust don't compromise the infrared scan
body heat triggers, a lubricant responds
but there aint no soul to feel

drone plane flies in the broad day light
guided to its target by a satallite
cellphone detonates a road side bomb
while the disco-tech burns to a techno song

(time time time...)
waitin for the rain to drop
(Time time time...)
waitin for the rain to drop
(time time time...)
waitin for the rain to drop
time time time...)
no better friend no worse enemy

(time time time...)
waitin for the rain to drop
(time time time...)
waitin for the rain to drop
(time time time...)
waitin for the rain to drop
(time time time...)
no better friend no worse enemy.
