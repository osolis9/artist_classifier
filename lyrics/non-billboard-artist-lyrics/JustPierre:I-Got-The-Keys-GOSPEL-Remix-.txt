I-Got-The-Keys-GOSPEL-Remix-:JustPierre
[Intro]
Uh. Yeah, yeah
Major key alert
We've been given the keys to the kingdom
Uh. Let's go

[Scripture: Matthew 16:19]
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven

[Chorus]
We got the keys, key, keys
We got the keys, key, keys
We got the keys, key, keys
We got the keys, key, keys
He went to court and stood in my place
I know the judge, He stood in my case
We got the keys, key, keys
We got the keys, key, keys

[Verse 1]
Whole team with me like a soccer mom
Masked up like Comic-Con
Ephesians 6, full armor on
We go to war, but ain't dropping bombs
This spiritual, we dropping Psalms
We wrestle with demonic pawns
Lucifer and his entourage
Tell 'em, step up in that octagon
Satan's throwing molotovs
I been through the fire like Chaka Khan
But I find strenght in the house of God
Through the King James, not LeBron
Satan want it? It's drama time
We'll bring the beef during Ramadan
At his front door like Papa John's
To his front porch like Amazon (Whoo!)
We can never be defeated
It's power in the name of Jesus
Call His name and you'll see demons
Get to running, get to fleeing
Gave His life for the heathen
Gave His life to redeem us
Now we're joint heirs with Christ
We got the keys to the kingdom

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Radar, rador on, radar, radar
Man, I just thank God I was even on His radar
Radar, rador on, radar, radar
Man, I just thank God I was on His radar

[Verse 2]
We've been forgiven of our charges
Hopped out of the courtroom like, "What charges?"
Death, where is thy victory?
Incase y'all ain't knowing, the Son ain't lost yet
Y'all know the battle's won soon as you call on the Son
Y'all know the different, right, from living wrong and living right?
They be like, "Turn up", I be like, "Grow up"
Went from being Rugrats, now we All Grown Up
My swag different, I act different
My Father's Yahweh, I brag different
I still pledge allegience, but now my flag different
I represent the kingdom, now let me get back to business
God bless you all, all praise to Yeshua
Gave His life to rescue all
Because His love, we stand in awe, Yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Interlude]
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven... {Dj scratch}
... Shall be bound in heaven
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven... {Dj scratch}
... Shall be loosed in heaven
Alert, alert, alert, alert, alert, alert
Alert, alert, alert, alert, we got 'em alert

[Chorus]
