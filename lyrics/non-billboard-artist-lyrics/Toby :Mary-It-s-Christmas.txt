Mary-It-s-Christmas:Toby 
You should see all the lights in our old neighborhood
I never thought that little street could ever look so good
I knew that she'd be busy, it's her favorite time of the year
And I don't think she notice, I slipped off to be here

Mary, it's Christmas and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
God knows if she could see us now, she wouldn't understand
But Mary, it's Christmas and I just had to take that chance

Don't the snow sure look pretty as the flakes are fallin' down?
It's a blanket from heaven coverin' the ground
And that cold wind can cut a man clear to the bone
I guess it's time I got up and took myself back home

Mary, it's Christmas and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
God knows if she could see us now, she wouldn't understand
But Mary, it's Christmas and I just had to take that chance

Well, she's started askin' questions, though she's barely two
Like, if reindeer fly to heaven, would Santa bring her love to you

Mary, it's Christmas and I just had to stop by
To spend a little time with you on this special night
Someday we'll be together forever but till then
But Mary, it's Christmas and I'll do the best I can

This cold wind can cut a man clear to the bone, I guess
It's time I got up off my knees and took myself back home
