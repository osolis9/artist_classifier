Bloodline:Bloodline
Now this curse lays dark and cold
Upon a world at sleep
The endless void that lies beyond
When aeons passed without cessation

Feel that flame that burns within
You try to hide your deepset sin
Turn your face to the burning sky
This is the doorway back to your Life

Drown in the shade of the sun

The bloodred waters are turning black
I can hear the echos of the past
Time fades like the moon in the sky
There's no tomorrow for the damned
