Politics of the business

The business, the business
Politics of the, the business, the business
Politics of the, the business
Politics of the business, the business
Politics of the, the business

Anybody who gets in this business
And lives his offer but he's living in a miracle

Aw man, fuck the music business, man
Fuck that, I wanna say when you just can't say
Fuck this business
You got to get in where you fit in
And understand what you get in

I uh, I mean, if somebody sits and talks to me
About the music business, I will tell him not to get in it
I will tell him that it's very, very, very complicated
And hard to actually cease something that living today

Politics of the business
Rap miserable muscles is that when
Cats all of a sudden look at BET
And say, "Aw man, we can do that
Man, I can outbone Jay-Z"

Yeah, in every one of these videos
You're gonna see some sacks
You're gonna see somebody tote some money
Or somebody acting like they shoot you
It ain't much in between

I have to tell the artist straight forward
You are not that great as you think you are
You smoke too much fucking weed
And when, when, when you hear yourself back
Every time, you're coming out and hating yourself

Politics of the business, the business, the business
You know, that's
That's the way to get fucked in the business
Of course, it's, it's, it's a cut throat business

It's what you know
What you know'll save you in this business all the time
And it's, I guess it's just the bottom line making a hit record
And uh, it's not simple as people think

You know it's very complicated
Yeah, if it did
Everybody would go make one right now
