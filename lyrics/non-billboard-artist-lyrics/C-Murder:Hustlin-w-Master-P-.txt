Hustlin-w-Master-P-:C-Murder
One in a half, two in a half, three in a half, four quarters
I think I might have a thousand grams
(One key)

Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh oh
Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh ooh

(Where them fiends at, I'll be right there in the hall way ya heard me)
Now picture me a street nigga went from weed to guns
My cousins a dope dealer now it's coke and funds
Now with the money comes bitches and with the feds comes snitches
I'm just a lil' nigga tryin' to go from rags to riches

'Cause in the ghetto niggas like to flip fo' and a half
The projects is home but the ghetto's my lab
Niggas scream third ward nigga we ready to ride
Niggas say fuck No Limit then we ready to die

Nigga fo' fives and nines we hold them high
Lil' niggas whoop whoop hide them pies
'Cause if it don't make dollars then it don't make sense
An if yo hustle ain't tight nigga you'll end up in the pen

Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh oh
Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh ooh

What if these mothafuckin' project bricks could talk
Would they tell what goes on nigga after dark?
Bullets spark young homies gettin' blasted
Sixteen in a muthafuckin' casket the games drastic

Live my life wit my thug soldiers gettin' high
Mixin' Hennessey and weed bitch it's do or die
When we ride to yo area
Tell yo family find where they can bury ya

My dawgs carry ah AK's and ski masks
If you got Ki's then yo niggas better hind yo ass
We blast like dope fiends roamin' the block
No matter how many niggas get popped drugs'll never stop believe dat

Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh oh
Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh ooh

(Check this out playa)
Now picture me a TRU nigga thugged out hustlin' hard
I hope you niggas understand I could never be soft
'Cause mentally I'm capable of over comin' the worst
I'm havin' flashes picture me in ashes and dirt

On a T-shirt a memory a thought of the past
I lost my brother to a muthafuckin' gun blast
I analyze every nigga watch his moves look in his eyes
'Cause you can never tell predicted dead or in jail nigga

Now tell me what you see
'Cause life's so hard for a Callio nigga like me ya dig
'Cause I'm gonna hustle til' I'm gone
Hit the highway and play again it's on in the ghetto

Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh oh
Hustlin', hustlin'
Tryin' to survive in the ghetto, ooh ooh
