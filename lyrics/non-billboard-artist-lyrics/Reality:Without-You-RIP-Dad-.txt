Without-You-RIP-Dad-:Reality
I should have seen it from the start,
A fake love disguised as what I wanted in my heart
It was convincing enough, it was so easy to trust
Oh, I just couldn't resist, it was the look in your eyes and the grace of your lips
You looked so different in the light that I'd been shining on you

You gave me heaven then you took it away
You let me in but you said I couldn't stay
Now my feet are back on the ground
And I'm stuck in a reality without you
(Without you, without you)
And now I'm stuck in a reality without you

I should have seen it from the start
That you would rip my heart to pieces and then throw it into the trunk of your car
Drive to the edge of the city, erasing any trace we were together before you felt guilty

You gave me heaven then you took it away
You let me in but you said I couldn't stay
Now my feet are back on the ground
And I'm stuck in a reality without you
(Without you, without you)
And now I'm stuck in a reality without you

I stepped into a house of lies, but I couldn't see it
Pretty faces hide dirty secrets
I lost my soul along the way
(I lost my soul along the way)
You got into my system and found out how to cheat it
I still play your game but I couldn't beat it
it was too late to get away
(It was too late to get away)

You gave me heaven then you took it away
You let me in but you said I couldn't stay
Now my feet are back on the ground
And I'm stuck in a reality without you
(Without you, without you)
And now I'm stuck in a reality without you

Without you, without you
And now I'm stuck in a reality without you
