It-s-a-S-C-C-Thang:South Central Cartel
[HAVIKK]
South Central got the niggas with the fat shit
The 6-4's on D's, Cadillacs with the bumper kits
Fat sounds in the trunks for the hoes try to skeeze on
But a nigga still packs chrome
And muthafuckas wanna rock this
They come from city to city, then hit the Central and they jock this
We slang lleyo in the blocks, fuck a cop and get paid G
Gangbanger peel a cap, see
Summer hoes on thick
They ride a nigga's dick like a tick
When they think a nigga's straight rich
A drive-by on a nigga: cap cap cap, yo!
Another life took, here we go
87's make em bow down
Hoovers and N-Hood's, 9-0's, unite right now
And East Coast peel a cap cause cops don't like this
But South Central's gettin' ruthless
It's S.C.C., Prodeje and Havikk, loc
Rollin deep like some muthafuckin criminals
The A.K. talks better if your ass try to creep on
It's South Central, get your head flown

[L.V.]
Watch your back because I'm movin' real slow
It's a S.C.C. thang...

[PRODEJE]
In the S.C. bitches jock
The niggas with a knock-knock
6-4's drop with the fat knot
Oreos get bent on the Ides and the E.T.
Shoot craps and slap bone, G
5.0.'s ride [?]
But after Rodney King O.G.'s load clips
You heard about the drive-by's, Crips and the Bloods servin' homicide
But now it's all about tryin to get unified
Let's take a stroll through my old shit
Manchester was the park where I kicked it
Hangin' on the one for the ends, what's the shot?
Servin' fat dubs to the clucks at my spot
I moved to the Seven and I still clock grips
Homies in the hood cap niggas off the tip
I went to Freemont, muthafucka, yeah, muthafucka
In S.C. it's straight on, muthafucka
Every city niggas got they shit
But yo, in S.C., boy, you gotta be legit
Cause you get clowned in the wrong hood, fuckin' with the wrong fool
And they don't give a fuck wearing county blues
[?] in the S.C.
I said it's on, and niggas stay down, yo, it's cool, G
L.A. is where is at, take it from the smooth criminals
It's something about South Central

[L.V.]
Watch your back because I'm movin' real slow
It's a S.C.C. thang...
It's a gangsta thang with the S.C. swing...
