Killa-Beez:Killa Beez
You're no warrior, you can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

Yo, yo, I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet
About my dirty habits, I got to have it
The super glow 'Deuce Bigelow, Male Gigolo'
Gold hands crush Coke cans an' Michelobs

Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles, voice, evil steelo
Hit like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle

Nine dirty strikes, lethal for you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole in the crime lab
Countin' Ginos, cuttin' dime slabs

Then he bagged up Chino
Rushed through the crowd with a hee ho
Slapshots, jackpots, an' pennals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin' up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo

In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero
Who's your rhymin' heroes?
Killa bees

You're no warrior, you can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

Bzz, you hear the hornet, you ducks don't want it
My dogs blast turbo, supersonic
Hats off, welcome back, whip the sweat off
Bobby Digital, half dead an' half cyborg

N.Y. City, home of the fly bitties
With high-heel shoes an' tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin' a buck forty in the yellow Spyder

With the black interior, my mack superior
To your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class an' bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves an' long chunky gold cables

Now I'm known to smack drum machines
Carry guillotines, watch my bullets scream
An' hit the target
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett

You're no warrior, you can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, you can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman
At a speed that exceeds your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens

Stay hotter than a ex-con, dodgin' the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
An' the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
Certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom

Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kingdom, reppin' from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems 'cuz yo we step on toes
Bangin' heads, knockin' teeth loose, welcome to the pros

Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael an' Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the Republic
Government, you ain't lovin' it, whatchu fuckin' wit?

Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside, I don't expect no love
Man, this grip make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid

You're no warrior, you can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, you can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
