Fire:Shad
rap genius - heads sayin he should blow (he should tho) 
rap genius - got good quotes and footnotes 
look - who else spittin the most urgent 
most soul-searchin perfectly dope verses 
and no curses 
ask any analyst, journalist, panelist 
whos canada's unimanimous circa 98 canibus 
ambulance vans when my jams spin - it's calamitous 
sendin bands into banishment 
dammit i need no laminate - yall know the name 
im the rap game villain 
shad k. back stage in the bat cave chillin 
bumpin bad brains with a bad dame 
wheelin in the fast lane 
rugrat still these cats cant kill him 
kids talkin bout, "i just need a co-sign - one break!" 
all i need's a drum break and one take 
im unsafe - yall soft as sunday brunch dates with bundt cake 
got crowds jumpin like i just done a pump fake 
man this is just 1/8th - just a morsel 
i got more flows 
yall just mortals, even moreso 
this is morse code from the north pole 
to warn folks: 
the storm crow's comin thru your war zone 
lords knows i was born dope 
goin back like corn rows 
i amaze (i am maize) like corn rows 
pure jokes still i can rage like hormones 
im a oracle, im next level: warp zone 
the forbes shows what they net 
but im more gross - sick as a sore throat 
the kid isnt normal 
hard core flows but he spit with a warm tone 
the whip isnt much but his chick is a norah jones 
im eatin all yall food by the fork load 
golden arches or ol girl with the orange fro 
no actually i'll have your pork roast and orzo 
make a short toast then pop the cork off the bordeaux 
i could hold court with the foremost 
i could tour coasts or teach a course load 
at the sorbonne 
forget 4 bars - every quarter note's historical 
when i perform poems 
im a force, im a horror show 
man im in my z---, im in your zone 
im on your porch, in your home 
takin everything like it foreclosed 
just me and t 
stakin claims, takin names 
i guess some things stay the same 
still the champ
