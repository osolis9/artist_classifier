I-m-Just-a-Man:Chaundon
[Hook: sample]
I'm just a man
Only a man yeah
I can't be more any more than I am now

[Verse 1: Chaundon]

I am the perfect imperfection ever made
Since Adam was created out of clay from the Lord that day
Which explains why I talk and maneuver how I do
Let me introduce myself my name is Chaun how are you?
No I'm not a drug dealer turned rapper over night
Don't claim I'm not a rapper like these suckers with a mic
I'm a man of many words keep it true to myself
Never needed to embellish about my women and my wealth
No I didn't run the streets never saw a day in Spofford
Grew up with some outlaws but that wasn't my outfit
Two parent home went to school strait shooter
Far from a Huxtable, troublesome eluder
Didn't want to fit in no pressure from my peers
As I stand out I earned more respect through out the years
Always kept it real so you know where I stand
I am nothing more or less of who I am, just a man

[Hook: sample]
I'm just a man
Only a man yeah
I can't be more any more than I am now
I can't be more any more any more than I am now
I can't be more any more any more than I am now

[Verse 2: Chaundon]

I am the perfect imperfection ever made
Since Eve was created from a rib by the Lord that day
Which explains why I rap about the things that I do
Let me introduce myself my name is Chaun how are you?
I am cut from a cloth none of y'all will ever wear
Authenticity is tailor made I am debonair
Looking good being me while everybody's playing dress up
Resembling each other clothes from the same dresser
Won't compromise my integrity to sell
If my music ain't for you keep it moving and be well
I will not apologize for the man that I am
Strait forward y'all know it any less would be a sham
I'm the last of a breed that exudes true excellence
But this game is fake what I'm saying is irrelevant
But I will never falter here is where I stand
If nothing more you will all respect me as a man

[Hook: sample]
I'm just a man
Only a man yeah
I can't be more any more than I am now
I can't be more any more any more than I am now
I can't be more any more any more than I am now
