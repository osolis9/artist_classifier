If-I-Knew-Then:Foreign Exchange
Good morning or evening friends
From time to time I wonder how
Much easier life could've been
If I knew then what I know now

Feels so good love's flying high
Feels so good love's flying high
Feels so good love's flying high
Feels so good love's flying high

I was searching for the answer
In the presence of all things new
But the love that I was hoping to find
Kept on leading me back to you

Feels so good love's flying high
(I'm shining)
Feels so good love's flying high
(You're beside me)
Feels so good love's flying high
(I'm shining)
Feels so good love's flying high

Now that I am here I choose to be
On my way to you where I feel free
No more wasting time now that I know
Anywhere you lead me I will go

So I had to take the time to say
I'm so thankful for a chance today
No more wasting time now that I know
Anywhere you lead me I will go
