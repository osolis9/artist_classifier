The-Headcracker-remix-:Double XX Posse
Yo, BK, whattup G?
Yo man, lemme tell you what happened to me the other night,
Right? I was at my man's house watching the basketball game...
Stepped outside to the store,
The police rolled up on me and told me I wilded somebody!
Word! Cold cracked my head man. Lemme tell you how it went...

The headcracker, the headcracker, the headcracker
The headcracker, the headcracker, the headcracker

It was a Saturday in May and we was coolin at the crib-o
Checkin out the game between Chicago and the Knicks
Sippin on a forty ounce and eatin some chicken
It wasn't Kentucky Fried, but it sure was finger lickin
Then I said, "Yo G, we need some more brewski.
So dig into your pockets and come out with some money.
A dollar bill a piece, that's enough to get it started.
I be right back y'all," and then I departed
I stepped out the door and headed straight for the liquor store
Recitin a funky rhyme well on the way as I go
I saw this cutie-pie with some light brown eyes
And told her she was lookin hotter than the 4th of July
And then out of nowhere the cops rolled up
And said, "Put your hands up"
I said, "Huh? What?"

Now they got me locked up for no reason at all
And everything was gettin hecitic so I asked to make a call
They told me not now, but maybe later if you could
I told em they was buggin and they misunderstood
They ran into my cell and threw me down on the ground
And started stompin on my back and told me not to make a sound
They hit me with a 1-2-3-4-5-6
A 7-8 a 9 or 10 and I was through buggin
I laid there in pain and more quiet than a church mouse
With speed knots growin on my head like rocks
And then they finally told me I was there for a robbery
That happened thirty minutes just before they spotted me
But I was at my homey's house watchin the game
And if you call his number they would tell you the same
The police laughed and said to tell it to the judge
But in the meantime kid, ya betta not budge

My pops bailed me out and told me he was ashamed
That I could get myself arrested and disgrace his name
I told him, "On the strength, you know me better than that!
This is a bad situation just because I'm black."
I'm not the only brother to have a bright red jacket
And why did they have to beat me up and look at me laughin
They even told me that they had an eye-witness
But she never showed up, so the judge said, "Dismiss this."
And then I told him how they beat me and kicked me
And all he had to say is, he couldn't do nothin for me
I had to file a formal complaint against the city
And go against the cops for police brutality

Now if you're not familiar with the word headcracks
It's anything that's kind of shocking or amusing, word
A funny type of saying is a headcracker
A fly cutie getting high is a headcracker
Your best friend having AIDS is a headcracker
Your lil sister turning tricks is a headcracker
Your girlfriend playing dirty is a headcracker
Yusef Hawkins being murdered is a headcracker
Vanilla Ice making records is a headcracker
And gettin robbed for your money is a headcracker
