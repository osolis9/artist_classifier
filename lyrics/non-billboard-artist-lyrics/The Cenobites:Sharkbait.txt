Sharkbait:The Cenobites
Drifiting on the sea
Everybody stares at me
They want to see me drown
See my body going down

They want to throw me for sharks
SHARKBAIT

The waves of blood are rushing near
They look at me full of fear
Curse you all I will say
I'm not going to die today

They want to throw me for the sharks
SHARKBAIT

One day I'll be coming back
Saling under pirates flag
Until then I will be
Resting in the deep blue sea

They want to throw me for the sharks
SHARKBAIT
