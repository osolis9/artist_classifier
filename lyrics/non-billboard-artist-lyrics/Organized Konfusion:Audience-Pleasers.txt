Audience-Pleasers:Organized Konfusion
By the grace of God, I give a speech like Malcolm
Expressin', flexin', flaunt the style that's wicked
(Uhh)
Inflicted, addicted, now people can't understand
The particular way that I've kicked it

Smooth, is it not? Is it dope? Is it hype? Is it hot?
(Mmm, yup, yup, mmm, hmm)
Easy for you to hum along to whenever I'm rappin'
Keepin' your feet, tappin' and keepin' your hands
Comin' together you may think you're nice but I am alpha, beta

Glee and clap on the microphone
To kick a rhyme like this one

Artistical formulas, label me as a hip lyric professor
Pressin' to be the one, a lyrical chauvanist
Study facts, my brother, read all about it
'Cause Prince Poetry and Monch gets on down undoubted

Somethin' smooth, yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
United together through thick and thin forever
Just for the people's pleasure this is something new for you
We are the simply too positive MC's

Design a rhyme like an inventor
Intertwine, combine the centrifugal forces in the center
Giving it a steady a flow, who's like dope
(You are)
Better yet, I'm like acid, cooler than Lake Placid

You're loving it when I'm passing it off, slick
(Slick)
So that you know
(So that you know)

Well, it's me your majesty, Prince Po, I flow
Like spring water out of a faucet when I complete it
The text like toss it 'cause I will toss it to the Pharoahe
Capital M, lowercase O then the N, then the C H

Witness the presence of the two N E W
Intellectual through rhythm, I went interjectin' you
A few messages, paragraphs, stories, a few laughs
When it comes to steppin', yo, there ain't no quarters

Or even a half like poison, I subject to feed you venom
I find 'em, line 'em up, I fold 'em up and Monch will kill 'em

Curteous, givin' a high-five or handshake
But I can flip like a chef at the House of Pancakes
When I speak, I create a new strange tongue
MC's clingin', I bring on a new swing and they swung

Off the tip, I'm well equipped to stick to the cut when rhymin'
The kind of MC you find with the mind of a [unverified]
Chronological timing or maybe Simon Bar Sinister

Hmm, mmm, mmm, yo
Sometimes I'd rather stop acceleratin' and flow
To a slower tempo, sit back, relax, bust
The introduction that you're sleepin' on, I must awaken you

Now come with us, cruise in 'cause me and Monch
Is takin' you to another dimension, keepin' you up to par
Look up to me as an advisor
Much wiser than the average rap star

You not as another but a brother who's hype
Simply too positive MC's, too dope, too trife
To comprehend, this is finally the end
To my foes and my skeezers, the audience pleasers

Somethin' smooth, yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
United together through thick and thin forever
Just for the people's pleasure this is something new for you
We are the simply too positive MC's
