Play-That-Beat:X-Ecutioners
P O P E
pope dope

Slow and steady
Bars rain down like confetti
trained for this day
ready before they said ready
On the road to riches and am heading for the headies
I play the game of thrones better than lena headey
Adrenaline flows, recharged flows, we charged with blows
this from a nigga with less highs
and many lows
lord knows, i've been running with my grind
since i was nine, around the time
eminem rapped about columbine
forgive me mama
but i'm about to bust
bust a nut on this beat to make a hit is a must
and am a better survivor tham those on the show lost
cos i go all intel whem i process my thoughts
Theres no king on the throne
they heatd me amd abdicated
Those who came resisting got decapitated
Those who stood afar could do no more than keep hating
how long we waited?
well thats a question for the ages
we came through the stages
beat boxing, flows dropping
and we're still bumping
16 bars, a 12 iron a sledge hammer
nigga and a cup of coffee
Dont come at me unless your mama's got you booked a coffin

I'm a beat killer
lyrical godzilla
Bars like kirikiri
Na why these rappers still dey envy me Pope's dope, no rope a dope
sleepers are slow
walk barefooted and you might slip a sole
lyrics eat deep into your soul
am am ogre yo
no pistols popping, just pistons in my head pumping
we dont give a fuck, the club is bumping
I do this for my niggas
hope we get the mulla yo
we aiming for billions
nigga fuck a million
done with silly flows
punchlines as hard as blows
and we got the keys to the citadel
kill a nigga dead
with flows hard as lead
shoot him in the head
take away his breath
in these streets, we were born and bred
bloodshot eyes
crimson or red
pick your choice
pikachu got you bleeding from the head
i aint worried about what niggas said
wicked bars coming out straight from me head
i'm pumped up from lifting bars
i got mistaken cos of my musclea for cultist affiliation by SARS
yes lord
genesis of the exodus of fake rappers
top heavy, built sturdy like young spartans
ghost patterns, you dont see them if you dont matter
Nigga pay your tribute or your blood gon spatter

'm a beat killer
lyrical godzilla
Bars like kirikiri
Na why these rappers still dey envy me though the road rough
me and my niggas gon prevail
lee got my back and i aint never gon fail
have you ever had dreams riding foriegn whips yo
we still making money calls even if theres no signal
spaz on the mix
mixing better than a chef
in a 5 star restaurant paid in foreign cash
and my nigga vyce cool as ice
hotter than spice
rappers hanging down heavy yeah
nigga find your source
bars on bars like i'm sleeping on your lady
my shit is always yes, no no or maybe
sick in a straitjacket you can call me crazy
but one thing i'll never be guilty of is being lazy
mazy mazy
my rhymes are complicated
my comeup is belated
my drive is being fueled by the comstamt streams of hatred
sweet flow nigga welcome to the willy wonk
this was promised man
nigga i'm the cjosen one
burst out of these chains like D'jango
flows so tight, submission acute angle
my girl had one job and she blew it
she said too long, i said nike just do it

'm a beat killer
a future drug dealer
Bars like kirikiri
Na why these rappers still dey envy me END
