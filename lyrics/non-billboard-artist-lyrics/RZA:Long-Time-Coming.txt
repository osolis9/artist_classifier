Long-Time-Coming:RZA
It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be okay
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

The great mind, surpass space and time
Seven plains of energy, interlace combine
Five conscious stages, stand up courageous
Change your polarity, seek mental clarity

Ziplock off the chronic, kissed it, then I twist it
Build on today's mathematic ballistics
I walk with the utmost honorable respect
It's a quick locked secret so Protect Ya Neck

This is Full Metal Jacket, ain't about that gossip
Nope, you get your face all over the bicep
Go out the closet, you slimy sausage
Six degrees of luxury with no deposit

They said a friend be sub blanked
A plane be sub tanked
A gat be sub shanked, look, I just hit jackpot
A hundred mil' to the bank

It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be okay
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

The continent splitter, the dominant figure
The mathematician who calculated God from nigga
The Zig Zag Zigga, who civilize the wigga
My vigorous attack on the track, slice a thousand giga

Bytes of information in one line, I sometime
Use the sky for a blanket, then I bathe in sunshine
Nine concubines and nine wives, nine lives
Nine grands sit on my side, we carry nine knives

Eighteen strikes from Low Hand, ain't no man
Can withstand the blow from the Wu-Tang Clan
I answer many questions of life without asking
Breathe in the stench of death without gasping

Fasting and praying while you laughing and playing
I am fast in my mind to attachment, what we came in
And go through the river of life, I stay floating
Live a hundred twenty degrees without quoting

It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be okay
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

I have no fascination with Satan, no relation to probation
I'm the sun sitting still, while you trapped in rotation
Every rebel's creation, every thought has been ovation
One demonstration, we civilized a whole entire nation

Attract a generation, who's built with elimination
Of wickedness and sickness, we striving for the bliss
We rising up our fists, five stage of consciousness
Keeping our promises, master our circumference

It's been a long time coming
Days, days are turning to nights now
They said, they said I'd be okay
But when I hear those church bells ringing
I begin to pray for today might be my dying day

It seems like life is gonna pass me by
But now I'm reborn to a new chance, a new opportunity
And life has just begun

If you ain't having a good time stop wasting your time
Seven plains of energy must interlace and combine
And all praises due to the Most High, I'm here forever
