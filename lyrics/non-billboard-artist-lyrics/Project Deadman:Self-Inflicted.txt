Self Inflicted
It's just another day for me.
I'm asking y'all to pray for me.
My life is wounded fatally.
You might as well just say to me
You hated me
And I could comprehend and understand it.
That I was the most fucked up and selfish person on the planet and granted. 
I know i can't go travel back through time.
Never the less explain my suicide through wicked rhymes.
I'm living this life through as many different phases as it takes me.
And it my own demise and through my eyes i'll let it brake me.
And masturbation lies upon the bottom of a bottle.
Drugs and alcohol go through my system full throttle.
Let me tell you something about this life that you don't cherish.
You'll only be living once, and through them heads you better perish. 
This life is self inflicted.
