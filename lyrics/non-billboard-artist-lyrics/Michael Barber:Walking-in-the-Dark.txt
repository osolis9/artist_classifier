Walking-in-the-Dark:Michael Barber
[Verse 1: Matty Moe]

Long Days, late nights in the studio
roll a couple J's, grab a bottle, let the liquor flow
close my eyes, turn on a beat, now I'm in my zone
use to wile out now that's changed since I'm fully grown
surround myself with good people, good music too
fully focused on my dreams more chance to make'em true
love the life that i live such a beautiful thing
not a materialistic person give a damn about bling
really just a simple man if you look inside
sit down for a minute and let's kick some rhymes
I don't have time to sweat the small shit
positive thinking and optimistic what you call this
if you wanna change be the change that you wanna see
misery loves company, that company don't follow me
if you wanna change be the change that you wanna see
misery loves company, that company don't follow me

[Hook:Michael Barber]
So I'm on the outside, outside looking in
if they only knew, knew where I been
hard but I'm walking step after step in the dark
Never saw the sunset

[verse 2:Fishscales of Nappy Roots]
Mike what up....Nappy I got you though...
I'm in my pops old pickup
trying to lift up to a better romance
seems the world only dicks us
I don't complain, let it rain, I'm going to twist up
to be happy what I gotta get rich for?
when I been poor, and I was happy with a buzz and my kinfolk
I believe if God brought us to it, than he can led us through it
so what you worried bout the rent for?
lighten up, light'em up, got plenty weed
spread love to my love ones and enemies
and to the big corporations giving that bread back
this year all of my yagers growing they dreads back
I admit that I'm living my life like I'm hybrid
smoke like a fire still drink like I'm Irish
but I always keep it Nappy
smoke until I'm happy
I'm riding to that other side catch me I'm....
