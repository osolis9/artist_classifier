Pimp-Tha-Pen:DJ Screw
[** feat. Lil Keke:]


[Lil Keke:]
I'm draped up and dripped out
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Three in the mornin, gettin' the gat out the stash spot
Fire up a fat sweet
Turnin' on the bulb lights
Hand on the wood grain
Ass on the tight white
I'm showin' naked ass in the great state of Texas
Home of the playas, so it never be no plexin'
So long we've been waitin'
Never ever hatin'
In Houston we Elbows, In Cali they Daytons
So 1996 you hoes better duck
Because the world gone drip candy and be all Screwed Up
Just pop in your grey cassette
Turn up your fuckin' deck
Lend me your ear because the SOUTHSIDE finna wreck
Down here we smoke tree
Then let the world see true hidden talent like Screw and Lil Keke
Ain't no love for hatas and you bustin dick suckas
On the south side we stay paid MuthaFucka!

[DJ Screw:]
Lil Keke gone and tell 'em what time it is...

[Lil Keke:]
It's time to lay 'em down like a fresh set of dominoes
To all the playas, all the pimps, all the bitches, and all the hoes
Who's the man, who's the boss
Who's the nigga that payed the cost
I really don't give a damn cause I ain't the one who gonna take the
Loss
Grippin a grand up in the slant workin' the wood It's understood,
Flippin these fo's and slammin these doors,
Pullin' these hoes, and wearing these clothes
Who in the the hell was able to tell the southside they had to chill
From hittin' that boulevard "con" belts and buckles, woman and grill
I'm poppin that trunk and smokin that skunk and pulling off candy red
Sittin on buck, not givin' a fuck and able to turn a head
Somethin' serious when I let go cause I got a way with words
I'm able to clown when using a noun to take the place of verbs
My lyrics go together like a pair of socks and shoes
My flow is slow because it's bolted down by DJ Screw
Take it from me, the nigga Lil Ke, the H- The A- the R- and D
Menace to society
Born and raised to be a G
I grabs the "phone" go on and on
Two or three songs I won't postpone
Cause these lyrics comin' the very top of my dome
So many ways it pays
If you can flip the script by moving your tongue
And take a dose and listen close, promise that you'll be sprung
Jackers and hustlers, players and macks
Foreign doors and Cadillacs
Syrup codine that makes you lean and killer sweets rolled out the sack
All these things remain the same because I'm so able to win,
All around, just bow down because Lil Keke pimps tha pen
