So-Long-Hotbox-Harry:Hotbox
In the hotbox
In the hotbox
I'm on my feet but I can't feel the ground
I'm swimming in the distorted sound
What? I can't hear you babe
This ain't my buzz, I inherit a high

Hi. How ya doin'? Have we been hear all night
Speak up, I can't hear you babe
High, losing it, losing it

High, losing it
In the hotbox
High, losing it, losing it
High, losing it
In the hotbox
High, losing it, losing it

High, losing it
In the hotbox
High, losing it, losing it
High, losing it
In the hotbox
Boy you and some girl just passed out
And to my left is the face of a clown
What? There's nothing funny babe
Them regulars still passing me rounds
No it's blunt but this punch knock me out

I'm not an heavyweight
Mix up in this sounds and these rainbow colored clouds
When those people climbing out and climbing in
Watch my head spin
Pink and grey allusion, all these colors are confusing
Don't remember what I'm doing
What? Sorry, anybody in?
This is such a pretty house before the lounge is emptied out
And now the televisions going "wipe that face off your grin"
Right now my mind is wasted, slow it down to taste this
Moment which slowly fading slowly in and I can't take this
In the hotbox Look at me all alone in the clouds
Ain't floating no more you can see me now
