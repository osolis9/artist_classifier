Come-N-Get-It:Travis Barker
Shady after math!
Ok! Let's go!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
Five, four, three, two, one!

[Chorus:]
Uhuuu, I got the pocket full of money,
My city goes...
You're acting like you're with it,
So come on baby, come and get it!
Wake in the morning, I'll let you go shop,
The sky is the limit, so come on baby,
Come and get it!
Smile for the cameras, the haters don't stop,
I love it when they watch,
So come on baby, come and get!
..smooth, I know you like it hot,
Let's turn it up tonight,
So come on baby, come and get it!

Don't you change your life!
Just pick a flight anywhere,
Friends to the Louie store, have your...
Put it on my charge, mercy...
My shit won't shine in bed, like love is in the air.
...compliments of daddy dearest
She stays in my vanity mirrors,
Looking as good as I allow her.
What I do is for the show,

...I don't know, I'm just fine without her!
...I'm pitched to the...
My butt all white, what could make me prouder!
This night is ours, go ahead,
Live a little, drink something in the mini bar,
We like the...
I never fly...when she's on the menstrual,
I try not to lie, cause that's when they get revengeful.
So sinful, now drop it like it's hot,
I tell her about each other, now fight for the top.

[Chorus:]
Uhuuu, I got the pocket full of money,
My city goes...
You're acting like you're with it,
So come on baby, come and get it!
Wake in the morning, I'll let you go shop,
The sky is the limit, so come on baby,
Come and get it!
Smile for the cameras, the haters don't stop,
I love it when they watch,
So come on baby, come and get!
..smooth, I know you like it hot,
Let's turn it up tonight,
So come on baby, come and get it!
