Let-Me-Take-Ya:Anotha Level
[** feat. Don Jagwarr:]


[Verse 1: ~Stenge~]
Well it's the short little Keebler with a flavor like a Rolo*
Saggin' like a cholo
Sportin' mad Polo
Settin' shit off like an arsonist
Startin' this rhyme
I used to pinch pennies, but now I pinch dimes
And quarters
Honey watch your order?
Cause if it's over ten than your ass is touchin' Stenge
Cause I'm tighter than a nun no joke
I take your ass to dinner so you know I gots to stroke
Cause I'm the freaky deeky
Bought my faucet, ain't leaky
Don't mistake me for a bitch cause my voice is kinda squeaky
Cause I pack a Smith & Wesson with my nigga adolescent, Bambino
Ced Twice and Stix & Stones
We slap friends, we slap foes, we slap hoes, whooooa
Check out my flows
I'm only 5'6" but no need for tippy toes

[Bambino]
Well follow my nose like these hoes that tag along
Wasn't made over night, it wasn't made in Hong Kong
I'm Bambino
The bullshit king
A fat booty and a hootie, that's my late night scene
And if I wasn't wreckin' beats I'd be chillin' with some hoes
(Swervin' in a Cutlass on vogues)
With many dips
I roll with my grip and chap stick
For my lips
Humps in the trunk with the guns and the clips
Inside my ride I hit the blunts and the spliffs
I also hit the stunts but it's rough on my kit
Shit
Quick as shit on my fit
And I don't like that one bit
But I continue through
You want a menu cool
I've served a billion plus and now I'm servin' you
Ayo they hold us and they hold us and they hold us now they let go
We're finally droppin'
Ooooh check the echo, echo, echo

[Ced Twice]
Now it's time for me to do the track like a hoe
Bend it, flex it, go for what I know
I'm the mellow macker, hit it from the backer
Honey don't act up or I might smack ya like 
Ike
Turner
Round and hit the door
My pockets are phat and I got whores in scores
Now let me say somethin' 'bout my rap skills
Brings thrills, pay skills, sends chills up and down your spine
I'm laid back recline
I check one two and run it down the line
Run it down the line

[Chorus] [Don Jagwarr]
The DJ, a playboy selection
The crowd never ram up this new style and fashion
So I just can't understand

And let me take you 
And let me take you
Let me take you

[Verse Two] [Bambino]
Well I can come from the top and still get props
Ayo a siren from cop couldn't make me stop
Because I don't smoke crack jack just fat sacks of indo
I'll whoop your ass with Ken on my Super Nintendo
Cause I kill a killer
Like I kill a Miller
I'm realer than a Jackson that shouldn't be a Thriller
Sport an even steven
Curls all around
I'm Polo down, ayo I smoke by the pound
And get petro, I'm gassed
I pull it than I pass
And made my high last cause I mix my blunt with hash
It's only resin silly peasant see you do not understand it
Had the hidden camera now Tamera is candid
I planned it again
Bambino hittin' skins
And that was by intent to my collection and ?

[Ced Twice]
Don't try to run my style
Of course it's an obstacle
S.P.5100 and Aeropostale
Boxers
Thanks for the jockers
I gotta get my propers
I drink Rum and Coke on the rocks
I blaze a blunt
Another level of hip hop
I'm down to the tip top
I flow and don't drip drop

[Stenge]
I got two thumbs up by I didn't need Siskel
Or Ebert
Just Cisco and just be erp
Or a-lert
The F.B.I. cause I'm a small fry
I don't sell Whoopers cause I don't need to lie in a tie
MP-60's are nifty 
Tool that's used by the Stenge
Then we
Wreck a funky jam
Wicked as The Omen
I like to pop a cherry of a Saint Mary's hoe and
Just keep on flowin'
Like Mississippi
Loungin' with the Level
Smokin' weed like a hippie
So adjust the treble and let the bass hit me
Adjust the treble and let the bass hit me

[All]
Turn up the bass, adjust the treble
And let me take you to a whole nother level
Turn up the bass, adjust the treble
And let me take you
And let me take you

[Chorus] [Don Jagwarr]
The DJ, a playboy selection
The crowd never ram up this new style and fashion
So I just can't understand

And let me take you 
And let me take you
Let me take you
