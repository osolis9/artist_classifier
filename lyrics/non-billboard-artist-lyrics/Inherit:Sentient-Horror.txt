Sentient-Horror:Inherit
You are no longer human*
With a mind uploaded
A tireless conscious grows weary 
No need for sleep , after 5 days
Sanity melts away
What is was to be human, gone
No mind left to decay
Computation blackout
Killing spree, of inhuman ways
Incoherent, images, irrational attacks
Confusion, fighting each other
Cannibalism , mass obliteration
Of living things and objects
A world without rest , no cortex
Yet a need to escape
Loss of function, paranoia
On a global scale
Infecting the hivemind
The world shutters as we slide
Towards the edge of darkness
