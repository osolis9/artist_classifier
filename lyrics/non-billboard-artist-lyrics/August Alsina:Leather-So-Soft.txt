Leather-So-Soft:August Alsina
It was nine o'three
Ninety-two date of birth right
Handed him my id
Hope that he don't look twice
Wait
He pat me down
He let me in
They playing cashing out
So now I'm cashing in
All I see is titties
Tens twenties and fifties
Every stripper up in this city
And they steady tryna come get me
So I sit down
Main stage
Keyshia rock
O.j.
Dolla bills
Stacked up
Hoe's lined up
Like its pay day
Its crazy
Real talk
Cause I swear its my first time
At a strip club
I'm fucked up
She lookin at me like yeah I'm lying

She say do you want a dance
I said what you waiting for
Now she saying follow me
I see the sign on the door
Champagne room
I know its going down
Now she want me on the couch
Right before she started on it
Pop it pop it
Now I don't want her to stop it
But I can see that she focused
And tryna get in my pocket
So I pull out the bank roll
And spend spend spend
She say money make her cum
So I tell her cum again
And now I'm back at the main stage
Getting my mind right
My homies asking me
What was it like

I say the leather soft
Her ass so soft
Panties in the way
So I told her take them off
And I'm like oh my God
Cause I go so hard
Leather so soft
Her ass so soft
Panties in the way
So I tell her take em off
And I'm like oh my God
Cause I go so hard
