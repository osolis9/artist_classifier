T-Shirt:Shontelle
Hey! Let me tell you now
Ooh, baby

Trying to decide, trying to decide
If I really wanna go out tonight
I never used to go out without ya
Not sure I remember how to

Gonna be late, gonna be late
But all my girls gon' have to wait
â€~Cause I don't know if I like my outfit
I tried everything in my closet

Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
Taking them off â€~cause I feel a fool
Trying to dress up when I'm missing you

I'ma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay, with nothing but your t-shirt on, ooh
With nothing but your t-shirt on, hey

Gotta be strong, gotta be strong
But I'm really hurting now that you're gone
I thought maybe I'd do some shopping
But I couldn't get past the door and

Now I don't know, now I don't know
If I'm ever really gon' let you go
And I couldn't even leave my apartment
I'm stripped down, torn up about it

Now nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
Taking them off â€~cause I feel a fool
Trying to dress up when I'm missing you

I'ma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay, with nothing but your t-shirt on
(I'm all by myself with)
With nothing but your t-shirt on, ooh

With nothing but your t-shirt on
  (â€~Cause I missed you, â€~cause I missed you)
With nothing but your t-shirt on
  (Said I missed you baby)

Trying to decide, trying to decide
If I really wanna go out tonight
I couldn't even leave my apartment
I'm stripped down, torn up about it

'Cause nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
Taking them off â€~cause I feel a fool
Trying to dress up when I'm missing you

I'ma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay

Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
Taking them off â€~cause I feel a fool
Trying to dress up when I'm missing you

I'ma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay

With nothing but your t-shirt on
Said I got nothing but your t-shirt on
  (â€~Cause I want to be close to you)
With nothing but your t-shirt on
  (I remember when you would like to see me)
With nothing but your t-shirt on

Nothing but your t-shirt on
(Let me tell you now)
Nothing but your t-shirt on
With nothing but your t-shirt on
Nothing but your t-shirt on
(Said nothing feels right)
With nothing but your t-shirt on
  (Nothing but your t-shirt on)
