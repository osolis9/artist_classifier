War-with-No-Mercy:Fesu
Deal with this god from the South, a Greenspoint fader
Laws sweat deep but them hoes just playa-hatas
This is what you do
Suck a dick up and hic up and you heard that from Fesu
I'm wishin these white folks dead
Put fear in they heart just to see the devil turn red
Bitch, try to stop me
Pull my shit off the shelf and go throw you off a carbon copy
I gotta let you know
I stopped eatin that swine
Bitch, for the last time
Fesu gotta check ya
Drop your ass and? damn sho don't respect ya
Fuck a wood and his wife
She just good for eatin pussy and suckin on a crack pipe
Them hoes tryin to curse me
But you can't, bitch, cause it's a war with no mercy

On the cool laws tryin to pop me
Hell yeah, they say them dopesales gettin sloppy
Huh - stomach this, I'm about to lose
Cause my p's and q's ain't keepin the new shoes
But in the 'Point them hoes takin these
Cause I'm breakin them bitches down havin dopefiends on they knees
A 9 to 5, I ain't takin that, I'm in for 24
Re-cookin that bagged dope
A master at them pot and pans
Waste my dope, fool, and I'm cold with the bare hands
Just as cold as it sounds
I whip your ass with a verb and lay you down with a pronoun
Them hoes tryin to curse me
Is that a trip? Naw, it's just a war with no mercy

It's a war with no mercy
When young niggas clown
Yo ass better duck down
It's a war with no mercy
You hear the ratatatat
Yo ass better duck down

At 6 people called me destructive
Cause I said fuck justice in examplified ruffness
An Asiatic black original man, I left my mark
And my set was a trailor park
Tuckin them hoes to the curb
See, your life ain't shit if them actions can't back up verbs
Now what's left?
Nothin but a punk muthafucka that's scared of Yusef
Livin in hell, carryin a torch
Can't play with the big boys, stay on your own porch
A god, livin like Farrhad did
Cast yo bid and get a split wig
In the 'Point we don't play that
We stick a dick in your mouth and say, "Fool, why you say that?"
This goes to the HPD
Bitch, it's a war with no (mercy)
