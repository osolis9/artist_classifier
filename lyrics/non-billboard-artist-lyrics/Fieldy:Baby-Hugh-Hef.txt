Baby-Hugh-Hef:Fieldy
Harlem? smoke rims on my benz
Black on Black, Escalade Cadillac
64 rags 100 gold tings that I've already shagged (aoh)
It's nice to have a choice for mutual yourse, you be the deuce
10 switches and bag, 20 inch crystals on my jag
White tv trucks for the bitches dickie sag
Don't get made because I'm a pimp dad
Pimp-daddy, rolling in my caddy
Pulling up to the club, smoking on a fatty
Pull out the rug for Mr. Mack Daddy
Walking into the club, all fits drunk and bratty
All this bitches on my dick in the vip lounge
Fieldy's a pimp, so I'll buy another round
Round 'em up quick, I'm flossing like a pimp

Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
KoRn brings the porn and a little of the fame
Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
Fieldy's got game so you better be warned
Baby Hugh Hef, will mack in the sack
Dr. Dreams got game, that's my rep
Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
Fieldy's Dreams, that's part of my game

Let me rub it in your face
Got millons in the bank from playing base
Don't hate cuz you can't relate
I'm counting my money all the way to the bank
I get everything I want, and everything I see
I'm a pimp by blood, just like Jay-Z
I might be in a white tee, wearing fresh chucks and some khakis
But you know and I know, it's all about accessories
I'm like a kind in a candy store if everything was free
It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it
Leave it to me, there ain't nothing to it
I'm the king of all dogs, you just never knew it

Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
KoRn brings the porn and a little of the fame
Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
Fieldy's got game so you better be warned
Baby Hugh Hef, will mack in the sack
Dr. Dreams got game, that's my rep
Baby Hugh Hef... and that's my name

Fieldy's Dreams, that's part of my game
I love the fame and the fortune, I can't complain
What a great life, aaaaauuhhh
If this here's wrong, who wanna be right?
Don't ask why ask why, don't be shy
Fieldy's dreams takes a portion of the pie
Hugh Hefner ain't shy, play-boi
Why ask why, Dr. Dreams will keep you high
Ain't no reason to lie
Baby Hugh Hef gunna take you on a ride
You all need to step, step to the side, slide slide slipity slide
Baby Hugh Hef staying drunk and high

Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
KoRn brings the porn and a little of the fame
Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
Fieldy's got game so you better be warned
Baby Hugh Hef, will mack in the sack
Dr. Dreams got game, that's my rep
Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
Fieldy's Dreams, that's part of my game

Baby Hugh Hef, will mack in the sack
Dr. Dreams got game, that's my rep
Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
Fieldy's Dreams, that's part of my game
Baby Hugh Hef, that's my name
KoRn brings the porn and a little of the fame
