Fountain-Of-Youth:Supastition
[Verse 1:]
You ever get the feelin' that you're growin' too old for your surroundings?*
Before you loved loud music but now you can't stand it in your eardrums poundin'
Things no longer seem so astoundin'
I recall the countless days when the sounds just blazed
And the music was beautiful, classic album sales didn't have to go through the roof
The bottom line was: you had to be talented, honestly
I played the music 24/7 non-stop, constantly
(Say word)
I don't know, but now-a-days there's no motivation
I find myself, mostly, listening to the oldies station
Like, "Damn I'm gettin' old"
When it plays I blurt the words
Start driftin' off and thinkin' when the song first emerged
I feel like my uncles when they used to come through
They told me, "Music just ain't what it used to be." 
I thought it was untrue
Far fetched and far from reality
Now every song is "Get crunk" or "I'm the best battle me."
Ahhh, I can't take it, man I'm growin' so impatient
So irritated with the commercial and college stations
Your tastes begin to change and shift when your metabolism slows down
Man, I don't know now
Damn I'm gettin' old 

[Chorus] [x2]
I'm searchin' for the fountain of youth
So I can slow down this aging process
There's days that I just
Feel so old within my mind
Everything seems 20 something years behind

[Verse Two]
My taste in women today is so different
I was out with the wifey when I noticed it
Damn I feel old as shit
I used to pick chicks up and ride around
To the other side of town, but I think about it now
Them girls never blessed a nigga with no gas money
I should have demanded cash and soon as they asked for me
I'm older now, ladies ain't no ridin' bicycles
I peep game on these dames, eyes wide as nickles
But back then I had a young man's perspective
Misguided by pride, I was picky and selective
Like, "Girls, no smokin' or drinkin'. I don't need the kids."
(Now-a-days) 
I just wanna find a woman with a decent gig
I'm not tryin' to fuss and fight
I just wanna sit back on the couch, stress free, and make it Blockbuster night
So she can bounce to the club, but me? I'm goin' to sleep
Or make my night productive, writin' rhymes and doin' some beats
I'm too old to be stressin' these broads
Who search through your crib on some jealous espionage
Checkin' your dresser and drawers
I used to be stuck in a cycle that I slowly broke out of
I can grow without love
I used to see how many numbers I can get in one night
But I found the bigger challenge is, tryin' to treat one right
I'm done spendin' money on sneakers and ill clothes
I'm savin' for my future, god damn I feel old
(And the music?)
Trust me man, it ain't the same
(And the clubs?)
Too much fightin', yo it ain't the same
(And the girls?)
They on some other shit, it ain't the same
(And hip hop?)
That on-line shit, it ain't the same
Trust me
(And the music?)
Man, it ain't the same
(And the clubs?)
Too much fightin', yo it ain't the same
(And the girls?)
They on some other shit, it ain't the same
(And hip hop?)
That on-line shit, it ain't the same
I must be gettin' old

[Chorus] [x2]
I'm searchin' for the fountain of youth
So I can slow down this aging process
There's days that I just
Feel so old within my mind
Everything seems 20 something years behind

[Outro]
I just don't feel the same way about shit no more, youknowhatI'msayin'? 
The music ain't the same. Hell, even the women seem watered down now-a-days
Niggas be tellin' me I'm just stuck in the past
Or maybe I'm just gettin' old
