Avalanche:Big Deal
[Verse 1]
My arms around the night
Make it mine
Holding it so tight
Let go light

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait your turn
Watch and learn
Taste so sweet
All of your house will burn
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha
[Chorus]
Everything arrives on time
I know it will
I know it will
All the lovers left behind
They’re loving still
They’re loving
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha

[Verse 2]
Heaven under the earth
Down in the dirt
As above so below
Good as gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait your turn
Watch and learn
Taste so sweet
All of your houses will burn
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha

[Chorus]
Everything arrives on time
I know it will
I know it will
All the lovers left behind
They’re loving still
They’re loving still

[Outro]
And you live
And you die
Then its over
You live as you’ve died
Then start over
Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha
