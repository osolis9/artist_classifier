Stuck-Together-Pieces:ATOMS
Our stuck together pieces
The joke is I don't need this
You can hardly tell the difference
Well I know but I don't care

Grown up together pieces
Our stuck together pieces
A loada near misses
Aw shucks, you got me

You can have anything that you want
Except the thing you really want
Go back to where you came from
Go back to what you know

Our stuck together pieces...

Why be rain when you could be sun?
Why tie yourself to anyone?
Why be here when you'd be somewhere else?
Well I know but I don't care

You don't get away
You don't get away so easily...

Mirror, mirror still the prettiest
To all points of the compass
Just tell us where the money is
On stuck together pieces
And a load of near misses
And a load of near misses
Well I don't want any trouble
but my brain is in a tangle

You don't get away
You don't get away so easily...
