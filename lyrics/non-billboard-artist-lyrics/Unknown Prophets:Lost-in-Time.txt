Lost-in-Time:Unknown Prophets
He needed an escape from this world
Cause since the loss of his girl
His life ain't been the same
His mind and beliefs have both changed
The time moves slowly
And lifes a lot more lonely
The road was once smooth but now it's rugged and stoney
So he grabs his only relief, from this grief
A 6 string that gives him the strength when troubled and weak
It's like she speaks to him through the chords and notes
It's how he copes, when he feels he's at the end of his rope
It's not that the strings and threads help him to forget
It's the melodies that remind him how good times were spent
And with each rhythmn, the pain starts subsiding
He departs from crying, he feels his soul flying
And with each strum he knows that the time will come
When both his and her souls will re-unite as one
Compositions care his conditions
Even though that she's gone and missing, he knows she still listens
So he plays his tunes, midnight morning and noon
Each song tells a story, like ancient rooms
Each note that he plays takes away the gloom
And gives back the strength that the pain used to consume
Some days are harder than others, knowing she's gone
But he learnt to bring her back, just by playing his songs
So at nights when he finds that it's hard to sleep
He just plays his guitar, makes it gently weep
It was like heaven when he touched those strings
It felt like heaven when he touched those strings
It took him to heaven when he touched those strings
It felt like heaven when he touched those strings
It was never quite clear why she was chosen as [? ]
And how she could never move forward like she was frozen as ice
On those dark and lonely nights
She'd hold her rosary tight
And call out to those heavens above
Because when she was a toddler, her father sexually abused her
And even though he did the wrong he labelled her the loser
And if she ever told a soul he promised he would shoot her
And claimed that it was all in love
He was an alcoholic, high off medication for depression
Not from sedatives, his views were negative since adolescence
He had no essence, he had no form of self-expression
Cause he drank so much liquor that he couldn't manage a sentence
He'd gripe then grumble, she remained polite and humble
She served his every need, cause if not she knew she'd bleed
She learnt her lesson quickly, and never said a word
Cause it was better for her if he was never disturbed
She was the woman of the house since her mum passed away
And when her father looked at her, all he saw was her mother's face
And she could hardly wait until that time of the day
When she could go up to her room and escape to another place
For when her father fell asleep, she'd grab her guitar
And instantly, she was freed from the scabs and the scars
It was the greatest relief because her mind was at peace
And she was away from the touch that she hated so much
Bottom line yo, she hated his guts
And even though she dreamed of happinness, she was making it up
Cause good things were non-existent in the life that she knew
But at least for a night, she could pretend it was true
So she strung those cords, and reached out to the Lord
And dreamed those dreams
About castles, kings and queens
And she played away every bit of her sorrow
Cause she knew she'd have to face tomorrow
It was like heaven when you plucked those strings
It felt like heaven when you plucked those strings
It took her to heaven when she plucked those strings
It felt like heaven when she plucked those strings
She played the guitar just to relive those times When they were both together and everything was fine
Cause he needed a way that he could go and escape
The pain that losing someone you love creates
See she played the guitar just to bring back the time
When she was alive and the sun used to shine
It was like travelling back into time
She could fly without wings
It was like heaven when he touched those strings
It was like heaven when he touched those strings
It felt like heaven when he touched those strings
It took him to heaven when he touched those strings
It felt like heaven when he touched those strings
