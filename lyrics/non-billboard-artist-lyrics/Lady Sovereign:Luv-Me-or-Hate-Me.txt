Luv-Me-or-Hate-Me:Lady Sovereign
Yeah
It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I dunno
Make way for the S-O-V!

Love me or hate me, it’s still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then, thank you!
If you hate me then, **** you!

Love me or hate me, it’s still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then, thank you!
If you hate me then, **** you!

I'm fat, I need to diet
No, in fact, I'm just too light
And I ain't got the biggest breastesses
But I write all the best disses
(Chuh-ching!)

I got hairy armpits
But I don't walk around like this
I wear a big baggy t-shirt
That hides that nasty shit

Ew, I never had my nails done
Bite them down until they're numb
I'm the one with the non-existent bum
Now I don’t really give uh!

I'm missin’ my shepherd's pie
Like a high maintenance chick missin' her diamonds
I'm missin' my Clippers lighters
Now bow down to your royal highness

No, I don’t own a Corgi
Had a hamster, it died ‘cause I ignored it
Go on then, go on report me!
I'm English, try and deport me!

Love me or hate me, it’s still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then, thank you!
If you hate me then, **** you!

Love me or hate me, it’s still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then, thank you!
If you hate me then, **** you!

I'm that funky little monkey
With the tiniest ears
I don't like drinkin’ fancy champy
I'll stick wit Heineken beers

Whoops! Might burp in ya face
A little unladylike, what can I say?
Well, oh gosh, I'm not posh, me? I wear odd socks
I do what I'm doin’ yeah

So everybody's entitled to opinions
I open my mouth and sh** I got millions
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid
I'll make you giggle till you’re sick
My nose jiggles when I spit

Yeah, I do have some stories
And it’s true I want all the glory
Go on then, come on support me
I'm English, try and deport me!

Love me or hate me, it’s still an obsession

If you love me then, thank you!
If you hate me then, **** you!

Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then, thank you!
If you hate me then, **** you!
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me, love me or hate me

So I can’t dance and I really can’t sing
I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign!
