Mark-Of-The-Beast:Immortal Technique
[with cuts by DJDPONE; feat. Akir & Beast 1333]

[Verse 1: Akir]
 Get ya dough watch it go, back to the peoples that holding some
 Basic H's secret states keepin the stuffs the stole it from
 Peter Jospeh told us so, only those that seem to know
 Can counteract the satus quo balance back wich way to go
 My rough ID CID used by the beast to track you yeah
 Charge in the car can cause an alarm
 That's part of the arm that traps you now
 Back to check in, you go inside you prepared to fly
 Watch for scalin you cannot hide
 Comfortable you roll no matter what you done
 What treats for sky? climbin a tree while I'm gettin high
 That big brother eagle start to die
 No matter what the reason we can devise
 The plant in the sea saw the seeds that provide?
 Away for us to breathe out the evilest side
 No need to kiss the dream is alive
 Free from the evils of the dreams inside

[Hook: Cuts by DJ Pone]

[Verse 2: Beast 1333]
 The world a mess, we all love to flash
 I won't stop till the people see sucsess
 I'm gonna beat to death some of the people left
 When the mark of the beast can't cheat the test
 You bare the mark I'll bare the mark
 When the blood in the waters there for sharks
 Now everybody wanna be cool with marx
 With the less than to buy them more the bar?
 And the world of fakes heres what it takes
 Gotta have big bars not baby grapes
 Now a crazy pace a do it face to face
 The whole race Some crazy fast babble
 With a warm embrace they go stab ya back
 And so whack that the hacks right back to tracks?
 So when the bombs attack we gon bomb em back
 With the cold fried rice jack to jack LMAO
 There's no latch attached, you can own ma soul
 So don't go go scroll po po patrol
 Let's go toe to toe and poe go throws?
 Soldiers soul so don't go throw stones?
 Don't need to croak don't need to flip
 What we need is change in leadership
 Won't leave it to a chance still need the clip?
 For the radar go from pete to pitt? bitch

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
 You think I don't notice the line when you cross it
 I'm like the mind of a genious trapped in a cerebral palsic
 You underestimate the hood you think niggas is stupid
 We read the countries credits, niggas know who produced it
 Why the fuck you think the pushing military recruitment
 America been platinum and she afraid of recoupment
 So when you try to close the boarder and don't let us in
 I'll overthrow califonria with 20 million mexicans
 Cubans and chinese who came looking for freedom
 Till they realised america was run by a demon
 And I don't mean George Bush he was a fuckin zero
 More like the roman emperor Nero
 Who did nothing while the black slum turned to atlantis
 I mean those behind the canvas that made the mechanics
 And then planned it, it sounds simple but stupid niggas won't understand it
 Until the mark of the beats has your face branded
