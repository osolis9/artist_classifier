Can't escape my love
Here? how it goes
You and me
Up and down but maybe this time
We?l get it right
Worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks
All it takes is some trying

Chorus:
If you feel like leaving
IM not gonna beg you to stay
Soon you?l be finding
You can run you can hide but you can? escape my love.

So if you go
You should know
It? hard to just forget the past
So fast
It was good
It was bad but it was real and that?
All you have
In the end our love mattered

Chorus:
If you feel like leaving
IM not gonna beg you to stay
Soon you?l be finding
You can run you can hide but you can? escape my love.

Here's how it goes
All it takes is some trying

Chorus repeated
