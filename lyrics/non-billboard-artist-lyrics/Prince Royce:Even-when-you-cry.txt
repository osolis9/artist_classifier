Even-when-you-cry:Prince Royce
Pour-pour-pouring
you can't help that you got sad eyes,
it hasn't been your day
I'm so-so-sorry, that you're only seeing gray skies
and there's nothing I can say
make-up running down your cheek,
you say please don't look at me,
you don't want me to see you like this.but baby

Even when u cry you're beautiful
you don't have to hide if you feel this way
you can let your tear drops hit the floor,
don't you worry, you're still perfect even when you cry
don't you worry, you're still perfect even when you cry

You're cra-cra-crazy if you think that you're not sexy,
just 'cause there's bag under your eyes,
Oh ba-ba-baby when the world it gets too heavy,
I'll be with you every time.
The make up running down your face
I will never look away
it's impossible for me to resist, baby

Even when u cry you're beautiful
you don't have to hide if you feel this way
you can let your tear drops hit the floor,
don't you worry, you're still perfect even when you cry
Don't you worry, you're still perfect even when you cry

You can cry all day cry all night,
you're still sexy in my eyes.
You can cry all day cry all night,
you're still sexy in my eyes.
You can cry all day cry all night,
you're still sexy in my eyes.
You can cry all day cry all night,

make-up running down your cheek,
you say please don't look at me,
you don't want me to see you like this.but baby

Even when u cry you're beautiful
you don't have to hide if you feel this way
you can let your tear drops hit the floor,
don't you worry, you're still perfect even when you cry
don't you worry, you're still perfect even when you cry
even when you cry
even when you cry
