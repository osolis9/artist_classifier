Skyline-Divided:Seven
Through the flood
Through the fire
Ashes falling down all around and
all the way
Carry your weight
All that I can say for always
Through the flood
Through the fire
Ashes falling down all around and
all the way
Carry your weight
All that I can say for always

The sun is falling on the other side
We'll crash and burn
Keep moving
Dilate
Uncover the eyes slowly
Let them see
You spend your life in doubt

You're witness to a tragedy
Difference in memory
We all fall the same
Just stay close, just stay close
Remain in doubt
Inspite of your walls

This song is dead on the outside
This state is not what you thought
Keep searching
Dilate
Uncover the eyes slowly
Let them see
You live your life
Just like

You're witness to a tragedy
Difference in memory
We all fall the same
Just stay close just stay close
Remain in doubt
In spite of your walls

You left me to die
And I wonder how you see
With failure in your eyes
Inspite of your walls

Into the web you climb
But something isn't right
We burn it all down and all along
We try our whole lives away
The ocean overtakes the ground
Its temporary and this is what we die for

Through the flood
Through the fire
Ashes falling down all around and
all the way
Carry your weight
All that I can say for always

Finally the ocean overtakes the ground
Its temporary and this is what we die for

You're witness to a tragedy
Difference in memory
We all fall the same
Just stay close, just stay close
Remain in doubt
In spite of your walls

You left me to die
And I wonder how you sleep
With failure in your eyes
Inspite of your walls

Finally the ocean overtakes the ground
Its temporary and this is what we die for

Forget I ever knew your name
Forget I ever knew your name
Forget I ever knew your name
Forget I ever knew your name
