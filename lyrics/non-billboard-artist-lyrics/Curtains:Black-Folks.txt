Black-Folks:Curtains
Hey... Look around you
Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up... I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang... It happened
Time's up, Armageddon
Fire... Meltdown
The sky is crumbling in

Black Curtains... Never ending

Escape... You're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair... Is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood... Is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate... Is coming
Welcome it with a smile

Black Curtains... Never ending, fall

Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom in spider's web
Suffocating, no one hears my calls
Never ending, till the black curtains falls

Snakes... Surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down... I'm drowning
How long, I hold my breath
Dogs... Are chasing
My legs are paralyzed
Pray... Don't find me
My life is fading fast
