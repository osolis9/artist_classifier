And watch how gentle I'll be when I rub your back

And ah lotta lovin for the whole night long
I'm gonna caress ya body and give you a kiss
And ah rub you down where you been missed
Nibble and your navel and kiss your thigh
Play with your hair cause I'm on a love high
Well I don't know its the way that I am
Introduce me to yo mother and I'll say hello mam

Respect my female and never get caught up

Feelings and thats why I always try
To be loyal and gentle and lay and lent
Observe the female incase I must leave camp
And if I have to break out you don't deserve
To live a good life and love a black hummin bird

And if you treat me then
