Our-Thing:Ghetto Commission
Featuring Mac Magic QB 

 [Ghetto Commission] 
 I'm from the dirty south where niggas go to prison just by word of mouth 
 Slangin quarter keys to make them G's is what it's all about 
 I was brought up in the city of? 
 Had nerve with that nigga Pepper 
 That's you gots to put pressure on me to make it so they test ya 
 I used to hang across that water 
 That mighty nine another second 
 While loungin in the club I pack a stunt nose Smith n Wesson 
 Fuckin hoes, split the blunts and optimos, that's a war 
 These niggas out chea cut throat, so the crime rate never falling 
 It's a swamp nigga, we all ghost fuckin riders as we stunt niggas 
 That scrappin shit ain't happenin see you dead if yous a punk nigga 
 We floss around in Lexuses, from the boot to Houston, Texas 
 Any? that disrespect us recieve a slug clean through thier vest 

 I'm from where niggas end up lookin like funnels 
 when they crossin my tunnel 
 Left them bloody puddles, so? represent my jungle 
 The bricks bitch, my rad row where we ride slow 
 Go to war with Calicos, sendin niggas to thier burial 
 I'm tellin ya niggas'll be smellin ya, back at the canal 
 Niggas know we living foul with televised murder trials 
 We hustle, duckin JP in laced up brees 
 White T's, we keep our rocks the same place we keep our D 
 We meet at club James, known for blood stains 
 Niggas stay in front of teeners get caught up in the game 
 Lickin shots all over the place, shots on Wayms and DeVilla 
 Betty street, Garden road, Westbank, home of killers 

 [Mac] 
 From the eastbank to the westbank, it's our thing 
 From the third ward to the ninth ward, it's our thing 
 It's a N.O. thing, an N.O. thing, an N.O. thing 
 Throw your hood up and claim nigga, it's an N.O. thing 

 [Ghetto Commission] 
 Let me tell you about them boys in the fifteenth ward 
 look they ain't playin 
 Any altercation with the enemy in they vicinity, they sprayin 
 When you see them niggas with the white hankerchiefs 
 You get to the land of the lost 
 Cause these niggas bout they paper, bout they come up at any cost 
 Many niggas done got killed on the battlefield over Clintonfield 
 Yall aint even got to front, if these twisted for arms soldiers real 
 They knockin nuts off back in the cutoff, them niggas bout it too 
 You doubt it, call session, you could be another bloody body too 
 If I was you I'd keep my tools livin around them vicious fools 
 Darkside, lightside, boatside, fuck homocide rules 
 Them boys over the hump poppin trunks if you gettin outta line 
 Hells yeah, niggas packin that nine, respect our fuckin mind 

 [Magic] 
 Now all you hear is ninth ward this, nigga ninth ward that 
 It's Mr. Magic, puttin my fuckin hood on the map 
 You wanna die motherfuckers cause you're fuckin with G's 
 You dig your own fuckin grave when your fuckin with these 
 So where my niggas at, throw your fuckin nine in the air 
 Respect my nine, I represent it like I just don't care 
 Desire and galvant, nigga don't fiend and flood 
 Be the only motherfuckers ever show me love 
 It's cause of me ninth ward comin up like a storm 
 So when you see me identify me by the nine on my arm 
 And if I die motherfuckers better sound the alarm 
 City under siege, Clinton couldn't stop this bomb 

 [QB] 
 Fuck with us you gettin slapped, only way survive the gun jam 
 Third ward, Parkway, Allaway, AK spray, now tell me who's the man 
 The click I roll with will leave you in the basement 
 Call your mama, tell her make a replacement 
 This nine must she waste it 
 No years I be facing in the crescent 
 Tryin to teach an adolescent, fuck them niggas I'm suggesting 
 You keep your mouth closed before your body wired with holes 
 Exploding blows, with blood all over your clothes 

 [Mac] 
 Check it 
 I'm camoflauged motherfucker, I bust em till they click 
 I make moves and keep these boss bitches up on my dick 
 Been camoflauge but ever since a young buck 
 I hit the scene like nigga what, do anybody wanna fuck 
 With this murda murda killer, blood spiller with rhyme 
 Or I cut your life short like my part in the last don 
 So much of a soldier even drove a tank to my prom 
 Affiliated with crime like you affiliated with moms 
 Nigga 
 That's it
