as a little kid i dreamt intense dreams

are what i'm chasing
feel a man amazing, right
but i can't see how my life
may have fallen by the waist side
Scenario one
hanging with mates who like to stay high
fucking up, going out, acting up, getting drunk
chucking up, acting tough, far too much got me copping upper cuts

not amused
sitution i'm facing
got me confused
back to me and my girl in high school
both 16 years of age
doing what lovers do
confusing independance with ignorance
having unprotected sex
now she falling pregnant
now we stressing bout how our parents going to act
will they kick us out of the house
or will they have our backs
to bring a child into this messy world
could be no more going out
no money for me or my gal
Scenario three
we get rid of the child
before we get to hear it laugh
or see a smile
live with the grief and keep the pain underneath
like six feet deep may it rest in peace
whats to become of us
