Take-Your-Best-Shot-Now-feat-J-MONEY:Cowboy Troy
In the winter December of '89
I picked up my pen
started makin' my rhymes
I appreciate the listener for takin' the time
cuz I'm pourin' out my soul with every lyric and line
an I remember what it's like to be the focus of a punchline
now the phone rings when the party's at crunch time
I was humble but you took it for weakness
Listen close and take notes
while the professor teaches

Maintain' my footin'
No shiftin' sand
It ain't quicksand
cuz above ground
I still stand
Move from the shadow
on the way to the Big Man
Strive for connection
without complexion
Changin' the game in a new direction
Keepin' you're attention
While I'm mic flexin'
Band on Grand Ole Opry
You can't stop me

CHORUS:
So take you're best shot now
Cuz I'm climbin' so high
You'll run out of ammo
Before you touch the sky
You think you're the first one
To try an bring me down
Buddy you don't realize
how long I've been around
Take you're best shot now

I never lived in the hood
But I used to work there
(Say man ain't you work in that shoe store?)
Yeah, I used to clerk there.
Rollin' through Dallas
Now they go berserk there
See the corner of my mouth (yeah)
It's called a smirk there.(oh)
Twinkle Twinkle Nashville Star
Is that you with the 20's on you're car
Is that you on my t.v. screen
with the Musik Mafia on you're team?
I've been strugglin' and strainin'
through misery and pain
tryin' to get the radio dj's to say my name
People used to laugh when I dressed like an offical
Now I'm eattin' steaks 'stead of chewin' on the gristle
I've had breakfast in Hamburg, dinner in London
Both in the same day and man it leaves you wonderin'
I hit the restaurants, now they play me close
They get their cameras when I butter my toast

CHORUS:
So take you're best shot now
Cuz I'm climbin' so high
You'll run out of ammo
Before you touch the sky
You think you're the first one
To try an bring me down
Buddy you don't realize
how long I've been around
Take you're best shot now

You might see me on the television here or there
But when you come to the show you see them hands in the air
And when I ask "Are you with me?" you hear the reply
The fans say "Aw yeah, til the day that we die."
Or at least until we're sick of what you got to say
Well let me tell you somethin' partner
That ain't happenin' today.
So get you somma that and listen to me
To spell country boy you need C-B-T.

CHORUS:
So take you're best shot now
Cuz I'm climbin' so high
You'll run out of ammo
Before you touch the sky
You think you're the first one
To try an bring me down
Buddy you don't realize
how long I've been around
Take you're best shot now
So take you're best shot now
Cuz I'm climbin' so high
You'll run out of ammo
Before you touch the sky
You think you're the first one
To try an bring me down
Buddy you don't realize
how long I've been around
Take you're best shot now
