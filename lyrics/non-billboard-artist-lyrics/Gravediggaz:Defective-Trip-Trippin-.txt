Defective-Trip-Trippin-:Gravediggaz
Wanna see something that could make ya sick?
Stand in front of jets on the Gaza strip
I used to take puffs from a car, jet in my garage
Then I get blitzed from the charge
I felt my head swayin, my eyes in a daze
Felt and violence and off balance I got drugged for days
A room full of smog, I dipped it in my dart
then I threws it at my dog
I need another hit, Hurry, Quick! Hurry, Quick!
My high's takin signs and the shit's about to kick
I'm gaspin' for air, my vision dissapears,
I'm blinkin' and I'm thinkin'--Yeah!
Word, cause that's the shit I was hawkin
So stay the fuck away cuz I spit when I'm talkin
Stupid, Stupid, Stupid, Stupid Punk--
When I'm trippin'

Chorus

Some people like cheeba, some like brew,
I get mad lifted off four gallons of glue,
Pretty soon I spin like a top, In the middle of the room
And the shit won't stop!
Now What I see when I triiiiippppp...
The rats in the basement all start to flip,
All through my building, from door to door,
I swear there's a fire, so I piss on the floor,
Now down the corridor was old fat Ned,
Schemin' on a blowjob from a crackhead,
He was like 'hey wanna piece little man?'
I was like 'Yo, I'm better off with my haaaannnndddd!'
Oh shit, reality returns,
I need another hit but the glue won't burn,
I'm cukoo and murderous, Just plain nuts,
smokin' sodium menthol cigarette butts,
and trippin'...

Chorus
(yo, pass it man)

86 on the strip, and yo' my hands was -------,
the reaper, the keeper, my niggaz let's get--------
----------- i put the high on the stimuli,
I'm like the two face, like the signs of gemini,
My head keeps on spinnin', constantly continuin'
Two tabs of mescaline, fucks up my adrenaline,
I'm in a----...Uhhhh... I can't escape it,
It's like.uggghh... goddamit--I hate it!
So take it like a (brine), from the grapes of a vine,
The wine, it fucks up my mind, everytime,
I'm goin', and all I wanna be doin' is bonin',
But like a dope fiend character I'm ------,
I'm stuck, fl-fl-flipping, sssslipping...
I'm tripping...

Life of the-----
Can be stopped by accident
When you're tripping
(Cuz I'm trippin')
