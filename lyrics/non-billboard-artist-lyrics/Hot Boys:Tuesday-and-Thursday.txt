Tuesday-and-Thursday:Hot Boys
Two of the hottest days of the week
They harrassin' and hackin' niggaz in that UPT
N.O.P.D. be rollin' so deep
They be fuckin' over niggaz kickin' in doors

Sometimes, they be pullin' triggers
Ya hustlin? Better chill out
'Cuz they not for jokin'
Making sure they close shop

All day they gon' be smoking
So I advise you just to stay inside
If they catch you down back
For sure you takin' that ride

Downtown, rilla
Where niggaz doin' time, be waitin'
Better be 'bout your issues
For your ass they gon' be chasin'

And every man for they self in that pen
So if ya all in nigga, ya all in for help
Ain't there nigga, ain't no callin'
So if ya got a chance run when ya hear that siren

Tuesday and Thursdays, they gon' be ridin'
Stay ducked off 'cuz it's safer when ya hidin'
And they don't give a fuck what shape and sizin'
Lock you down prison rate steady risin'

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street

Shit, nigga betta hop, skip and jump on the block
On Tuesdays and Thursdays better run from the block
Stay there if you want and get
Ya on them white boys and get hung from a

Look, look, look, look, look
Nigga betta run If u got some
Lookin' for some freedom find that you will get none
And damn, I ain't even much see my P.O. last month

I'ma play the hotel
I missed my court date, I ain't tryin' to end up in jail
I'ma put up some mail in case I have to make bail
I'ma still rhyme swell, shit, might as well

And stay from the block 'cuz it be hotter then hell
I'ma tell ya now, they don't give a damn about ya
End up in that place and toy around and be forgotten
They rotten like a whole apple off a forbidden tree
On Tuesdays and Thursdays you won't find me

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street

ATF be showin' they ass around my block
Feds get all the respect 'cuz they'll close up shop
Who do you think be pushin' them birds up in the hood?
Who do you think be dumpin' them bodies up in the wood?

It's something like baseball, three strikes and you're out
Violate your probation, two and a half on five
My pride don't want me to be up in this place
My pride don't want the Lord to notice my face

A young nigga with golds behind tens on dubs
In the paper license plates, they gon' think I'm a thug
They gon' tear this motherfucker up, lookin' for drugs
And make them dogs break me off trying to get me to talk

You wouldn't believe the shit with the police, I done been through
I done seen some shit they did to people, I'm kin to
My friends too, that's why I be chillin' ya heard me?
Up in my fuckin' residence on Tuesdays and Thursdays

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street

Certain days lil B.Geezy hit the block and hang
Two days out the week I lay low 'cuz them people gon' swang
I ain't bout gettin hack Juvey, that ain't my thang
Police ridin' my back, scoping out my rang

I play it smart, I ain't stupid, I know when to leave the block
I know how to peep the scene, I know when it's hot
Oh, them jump hot boys, they'll take your loot
Tuesdays and Thursdays them big

White boys have a nigga spooked
They be three deep, creepin'
Comin' 'round the corner, peepin, they sweepin'

But they ain't gonna catch me slippin', I'm rollin' out
I'm gon' chill by a bitch and cool out on the couch
Smoke blunt after blunt till I pass out
When it get dark and cool off then I'ma smash out

I respect the task force they don't give a fuck
For anything they'll have ya in central lock up
On Tuesdays and Thursdays

Whoa, now there u have it Tuesdays and Thursdays
The whole task force for yo' ass
(Nigga just givin' ya some game, ya dig?)
For sho', them white folks don't wanna see a nigga ballin'
Wanna see us crawl bruh for sho', lookee here

On Mondays, you can run all day
On Tuesdays, sit ya ass down
(Duck out playboy)
On Wednesdays, you can slang all day

On Thursdays, sit ya ass back down
(Off top)
On Fridays, you can fuck all day
On Saturdays and Sundays, you cool boy, believe that

You can take this for what it's worth playboy
And don't use ya brain
And take heed to what CMB be saying
Fuck around and be in that cage like a

Ole' dog, treatin' a nigga like a puppet
Takin' orders like a bitch
But a nigga gotta use that game
And stay up and try to stay rich man
