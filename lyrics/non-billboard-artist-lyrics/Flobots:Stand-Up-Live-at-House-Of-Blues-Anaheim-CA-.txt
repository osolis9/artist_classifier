Stand up
We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

Stand up
We shall not be moved
Except by a woman dying from a loss of food
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

We still don't understand thunder and lightning
Flashback to when we didn't fund the dam
Didn't fund the damn levee
No wonder, man
Now our whole damn city's torn asunder, man
Underwater, but we still don't understand
We see hurricane spills overrun the land
Through gaps you couldn't fill with a hundred tons of sand
No we still don't understand
We've seen planes in the windows of buildings
Crumbled in
We've seen flames sending chills through London
And we've sent planes to kill them
And some of them are children
But still we crumble under buildin'
Underfunded, but we still don't understand
Under God, but we kill like the Son of Sam
But if you feel like I feel about the son of man
We will overcome

So stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

Stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Except by a woman dying from a loss of food
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

I said put your hands up and I'll copy you
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
Except by a woman dying from a loss of food
Except by a freedom fighter bleeding on a cross for you

We shall not be moved
Except by a system thats rotting through
Neglecting the victims and ordering the cops to shoot
High treason now we need to prosecute

So stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
And we wont fight a war for fossil fuel
Times like this that if you want to plot a coup
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

Stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Unless we are taking a route we have not pursued
So if you've got a dream and a lot to do
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
I said put your hands up and I'll copy you
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
If you've got a dream and a lot to do
Put your hands up

Now shake, shake a Polaroid dream
Nightmare negatives develop on the screen
We sit back and wait for the government team
Criticize they, but who the fuck are we?
The people want peace, but the leaders want war
Neighbors don't speak, peak through the front door
House representatives preach "stay the course"
It's time for a leap of faith once more
Put your hands up high if you haven't abandoned
Hope that the pen strokes stronger than the cannon
Balls to the wall, nose to the grindstone
My interrogation techniques leave ya mind blown
Places your bets, let's speak to the enemy
Don't let them pretend that we seek blood
And whose we anyway kimosabai?
Mighty warlord, wannabe street thug
A threat for a threat leaves the whole world terrified
Blow for blow never settles the score
Word for word its time to be clarified
We the people did not want war

So stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Except by a child with no socks and shoes
If you've got more to give than you've got to prove
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

Stand up (Stand up)
We shall not be moved
Unless we are taking a route we have not pursued
So if you've got a dream and a lot to do
Put your hands up and I'll copy you

I said put your hands up and I'll copy you
Put your hands up and I'll copy you
If you've got a dream and a lot to do
Put your hands up
