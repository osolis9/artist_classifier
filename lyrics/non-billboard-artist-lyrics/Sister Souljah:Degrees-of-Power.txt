Degrees-of-Power:Sister Souljah
Being both feminine and strong represents no conflict
African women have always been powerful,
decisive and strong
And in a state of war, we must be even stronger

I'm coming up from the bottom
And I'm damn sure rising
You tried to stop me so I guess I'm surprising
I'll never keep quiet, so don't even try it
Sit in the back row, I won't buy it
Necessary but secondary, that's your insecurity
You fear my essence, my soul, my mind
And black man, you fear my purity

My brain is blazing strong and uprising
My mind is thinking faster than my eyes be blinking
Check out the science of me, and my chemitry
Aesthetic, altruistic, thoughts flow endlessly
Flowing and growing, showing and proving
Pulled by gravity, but I keep moving with

360 degrees [x4]

Ancestors blessed me with the power of spirits
Dominate my thoughts, I'm not trying to hear it
I'm stronger than that, too bold, deep and black
On a feminine curve with nerve
You thought I was a noun, but no way I'm a verb
An action word, a secret for centuries
But now the cat's out the bag
Strong black woman you should be glad
You have 360 degrees of power, girl, you bad
No adjective can describe my objective
Original cradle rocker, positive conquers the negative
You started me braggin, played with my esteem
Now you're mad cause I'm rising like steam
Reduce me to a curve, a swivel or twist
Cause my hips bring you pleasure and eternal bliss
Don't mean to intimidate, relax while I insulate
Your children and your entire nation
No buck whilin, no misbehaving
Powerful but won't misuse it
Take advantage or abuse it
Keep in mind before you go, it's what you need
If you're gonna grow
