Dream-On-the-Dancefloor-Instrumental-:Basshunter
There's a place I go that no one knows
I can take you there if you let me in
When you believe in change it sets you free
When you believe in faith it makes you dream

Like a dream on the dancefloor
You breathe on the dancefloor
You're mean on the dancefloor
You're free on the dancefloor

Don't worry, you're a dream on the dancefloor
Don't worry, you're free on the dancefloor
Don't worry, you're a dream on the dancefloor

When you see the future come with me
You stay up all night can I make you feel
When you believe in change it sets you free
When you believe in faith it makes you dream

Like a dream on the dancefloor
You breathe on dancefloor
You're mean on the dancefloor
You're free on the dancefloor

Don't worry, you're a dream on the dancefloor
Don't worry, you're free on the dancefloor
Don't worry, you're a dream on the dancefloor

Don't worry, you're a dream on the dancefloor
