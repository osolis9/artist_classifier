California-Dreamin-:Dream Warriors
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
But eventually everything becomes a dirt pit
In a showroom frame I attract another hit
If you run to the sun, call Lu, then you trip
I think it's time for you to retire, you skipped
That's what you get when you suck to much sess
You get penis end, like the girl in the tight dress
A mess hall, we all in your balling
There's no where to run when the roll is calling
May it be me, cause I flow from within girls
Tell me I'm a ho, drop the stereo and we can flow
Loop like cause this might be magic
Watch it might engulf you and catch your snatch
There it is, what it is
A house is in the middle of the street
To swallow my gift is a feat
But I hate to see without eyes
When people try to sabotage
But I'm quite sucesful at espeanage
Try harder man, come on harder
Cause if you don't, then come on, why bother
You're in my air evaporate at a rate greater than wait
I'm changing fate
Hey, look
I made ya look
Who's in the kitchen cookin' chicken, mama
Exscuse me baby I don't mean to interupt
But my mind's corrupt now that you got my interest up
You're best I edit the wish bones before I credit
Cause I must show my versatility facility
Peep me like tom
Must you, I bust you
I smash you into dirt and leave your crew laughin' at ya
I'm coolin' like Laverte
You're hurt if I'm leavin' you
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
But eventually everything becomes a dirt pit
Plot thickens
When reflects is flex like the sex faces
Into private places
It's me baby
(is it you Lu? really really you?)
Touch me and tell me if it's true
Did ya miss?
(yeah, I miss. Did you?)
Yeah I miss
Then commence to kiss kiss give me sugar
Cause you be the bonafied baby booger
You know, we go togeter like a gun and a trigger
(yeah right, then who's this? I can't beleive this. I thought I was the
World to you. Shit, what is this?)
Come on baby, you're trippin' to illusion conclusions
You think I would want that old broken down car
Now who picks me up when I'm down
Come on, who puts a smile on my frowm
Come on who makes mmmmmm
(you crazy)
So then let's blow this joint with God speed
Cause you know, I've got the remedy for what you need
Twelve inches of steel, spinning wheel
Cause you can't fight the feel when I'm in
Better turn the volume up to ten, and dim the lights
Cause tonight, you're takin' flight

Ah, but the next day somethin' went wrong
Huh, she slipped
Found a note, must've fell from her coat
Said I'll meet you at the Eaton Centre at a quarter to eight
And don't be late
Okay, so I thought about the shit that my mind was going through
Took two???? pills and then called the crew
My crew said "chill King, we'll fix it, don't sweat it"
"bother you? don't let it"
I got it
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
But eventually everything becomes a dirt pit
But that's what you get
Like a need a mostly dream
Like a dream, you sit inside a pit and you fiend
Now pain, pick axe and shovel, I digged and
I gotta get out, I gotta get out, gotta get out
Of this pit, I'm bigger than her
But my chest is crushed turned to mush
For real
If I ever shot myself it was just to get the feel
So suicide was out of the question
Did I mention
I didn't get a tricycle, thanks to Mr. Trojan
I'd be walking around like these other brothers, trippin'
Aimlessly, like a record skippin'
But once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy and I won't lie
MC's that think I didn't evolve got something comin'
I sleep with words and verbs is my pussy
Fattened like a cat, got your tongue you dirty rat
There's some wisdom in retreat, think of that
Your impact is hollow and you follow and submerge
Now people pull your card, you're livin' on the verge
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
But eventually everything becomes a dirt pit
