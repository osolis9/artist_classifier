I built an ark she shaking her sexy ass
She mad enough to buy her friend the big ass
Now I’m bailing off, in that range rover
I peel that paper off them …when I get that baking soda
50 bottles on the table we stunting for real
I’m peeling off paying the bills, she popping the pills
Ecstasy is played out, she popping that molly
When I peel that banana clip watch this mugging get muggy
Oh I peeled her off, she bought a berkin bag
Now all them other girls that she working with mad
… for you, like why y’all hating hoe,
Y’all looking for them broke niggas, she know who to shake it for

Yeah I’ma peel her off, Lamborghini peeling off

Screaming fuck the law, that’s why I break them off
Poppy got 100 bricks, yeah I’ma take em off
It’s the murda team nigga and we came to ball
Throw that money in the sky and just watch it fall
I threw her red bottoms, I threw her chanel
You just threw her the hand do it some brand for a nail
She making it clap, she dropping it low
Bands ah make her dance so I covered the floor

Had the murk scene come take that off
Bad bitches, is all I roll with
Niggas we don’t need your money we can buy our own shit
Sexy bitches, with a lot of swag, niggas buy me cars without me shaking my ass

I peeled her off cause I felt that ass is soft
So I peeled a couple more to make the peel…soft
She say you a murda team and I say why you call
You never heard of me, bitch I’m diddy bout to ball
So what’s your call, for us to floor
Bb … Lamborghini with the lipstick gloss
So you can pick and choose now the choice is yours
But think fast before the …start peeling off
These niggas dead broke, and they dead soft
Me I’m peeling out I’m peeling off
I said I’m peeling off, I said I’m peeling off
You hear my engine going wroom wroom,
I said I’m peeling off.
