[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
From Mexico City, we pass around plugs,

He wanna cut me off, Cause I keep fuckin' up the money (the money)
I passed him a lick, so I get half of the money
Magic City money, Scooter passin' out hunids,

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Pass around bitches, Pass around triggers, Pass around a nigga,
Cause I don't fuck with niggas,
I might pass around yo sister, ol' hatin' ass nigga
Passin' around patron, I drink lean not liquor
I'm not a Ciroc boy, I'm a double block boy
And it's pimps ahoy, not chips ahoy, and I'm a Block Boy
I'm a pull up to the plane, in my drop top toy
Who might pass you the highway, you don't want it with ya boy
That's yo girl, now she's Georgia's most wanted with ya boy
Put them goons on ya, think yo house was haunted by ya boy
Sticks and stones can't break her bones, but these sticks will cut ya ass out
When they brought the news to yo baby mama, man she passed out!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
We gon' pass around rola, and I
Pass around loud, and I'm thoroughly respected you can
Ask around town
Sippin' on brown, (work)
Puttin' my shit down,
Y'all ain't fly, might as well drown
Y'all act drive like an impound (verrummm)
But already though
All my shows ready to go,
All my soldiers trained to go
Album and my chain is gold
You don't want it,
Me and Guwop
Cold stuntin'
Whole summer,
Whole town
Ho we Third in goal
Runnin'
I'm a pass around lean,
My Houston bitch gon'
Call me, passed her off to Andre
Never gave a [?]
Not like Andre and Big Boi,
But like Outkast give her a good bone,
Woo! Good God passin' around gift, passin' around
Flow (work)
