The-Rhythm:Kwame
Ladies and gentlemen
The KitKat Club is proud to present
Something new something different
So would you please give a warm welcome to
The Rhythm

Well I came here for something funky to happen, is this Christmas?
'Cuz everybody's rappin' you better get sparked by the song that I sing
Although my name ain't Martin Luther but I'm considered the king
Yo my beats pumped by the mic I clamp, I don't need an amplifier
My brain is the amp, I got the beats that make you tingle
Make your body mingle like you got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle
Weak I say not so I'm just like Picasso a pioneer I am here
Ask me how I got so fly any sense that I can give 'em a new beginning

Stevie-o and my dope rhythm I sent the Lord master give a mental harm
My sole chief belief is that Islam my beats pumped so let it grab ya
I got a trick but my name ain't Ali-Babba so open Sesame
Neva heard the best of me betcha all the people in the place is whack
Now let's see it's a new beginning, my name Kwame and if you didn't
Know I could tell you that I'm a mellow cool brother slicker than oil
Rap get so hot it makes the spit boil the Rhythm

Alright
Alright

Not the average rapper the K is more, rhymes like the thunderbolt
Of the mighty Thor pick a cell 'cuz I can conquer boy
I break MC's like a Tonka Toy smooth suave savage yet Debonair
Come in the party yeah I see you stop and stare to hear the man
To only have yo hand shook, you dress too cute to me you have
The Jordache look 'cuz I'm the mystical rap is polyphysical
Ask about Kwame hey say he is a musical fellow he always mellow
He's never high stung spunk and when the mic is near him it cleva

I run smooth like Moet recite just like a poet ain't my slam oh man
I know it 'cuz when I'm on the mic while boys say oh Golly
Chick on my tip like a hip on poly grip I go cameo be on the
Grammy show I be sleek as a sheik out freak ganny ho in the panty
Hose pumping close yo my rhymes slam well I suppose 'cuz
I'm might need her um go washin' that again to write a fresh rhyme
You know I can again 'cuz I destroy plus I'm like a hemorrhoid
Strong like a steroid avoid the Noid, the Rhythm

Alright
Alright

The black can take the rap to the M A X and as I step in the party
That's when they ask for me to get on strong no fear like a Gladiator
Turn on steam up MC like a radiator play 'em all out executioner style
Speak my peace just release refusing to smile this is serious though
I rap a little humor but still MC I hear assume I could never bust
A fat rap twice and at that price on any mic you gave me I got nice
A push a pull up a sit up get up I'm fed up shut ya lip up
And let's go head up, poisonous as venom no mistakes in 'em

Gucci on silk you got Vasco in denim, no my name ain't Taco Emilio
Or Paco but Kwame boy and I got you chick on the side
'Cuz she sweatin' my tip, gave a peck on the neck just to wetten my lip
I don't drop my pants for those Raggedy Anns, just to pass
Up a chance on a kids romance I should have blown this mic
Like I said I might got the force of 20 men like a Jedi knight
And it's kinda hard for me not to do it slow so I gotta go, the Rhythm

Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
