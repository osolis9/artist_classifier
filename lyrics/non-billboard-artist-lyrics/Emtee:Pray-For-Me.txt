Pray-For-Me:Emtee
I just wanna be a hero to all of
the people that told me that I
would be something
I just wanna see my son living
life watching and never
forgetting that daddy is hustling
I know we gonna make it
I just wanna be your favourite
These are the things that I wanna
do
I could go all day but
Lord please keep mama safe
I'm tryna move to another place
See a smile on her face
My son finna rock polo forever
Just to show him daddy kept it
together
Him struggle like me no never
He was born and I climbed up the
ladder
Now they know my name
They love my chase
For my people me I'll never
change
Somebody pray for me Oh Lord
If you knew what I'm going
through
He say she say who gives a damn
All this talk got me going ham
Me I stuck to the plan
I sing I write and I needed a
bang
I know that mama is praying
Them haters forgot all of the
shit they were saying
I'm bout to go super saiyan
They still think I'm playing
Came from the bottom got high
like Jamaican
Me I'm an artist focus on your
day shift
Don't say shit especially if your
swagger is just basic
Hommie just face it
I got the juice nizogcwala
La ang'fikanga mahala
I got the juice nizogcwala
Swag game got a B on a hanna
I had a dream that I buzzing
Rihanna
Somebody pray for me Oh Lord
If you knew what I'm going
through
Oh Lord
