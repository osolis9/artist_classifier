Nightmare-Oddisee-Remix-:7evenThirty
[Verse 1] I can hear it happenin’ again/ Frequencies form the outer limits tappin’ in/ To my brain implants/ Telling me it’s time for impact/ Gotta start smashin’ shit/ Immo turn the whole city to a vacant lot/ The mothership’s comin’ and it needs a landing spot/ A building collapsed while I’m still spittin’ raps/ I get chills from the thrill of the kill and then still/ In the back of my mind, I hear my conscious call/ My woman and child, that;s where my conflict starts/ I’m too connected to take them away/ So I’ll keep them protected, but no one else is safe/ I know that it’s selfish and everyone else will be helpless/ When I go into overkill/ And start loosing control of my motor skills/ “Cause soon, Immo be remote controlled by them/ It’s gone be ulgy

[Hook] This is the new danger/ Bizarre behavior fueled by my anger/ And it’s gettin’ more live-er/ Fire/ Devastation let loose from my chamber/ When the cannon bangin’ out bangers, you’ll testify you ain’t seen nothin’ stranger/ And in the end you’ll see standing right there/ Staring at you with a glare/ This is the new danger/ Bizarre behavior fueled by my anger/ And it’s gettin’ more live-er/ Fire/ Devastation let loose from my chamber/ And yes heads are gone fly/ So many people are gone die/ And in end I’ll still be standing right there/ You can’t prepare for this heavenly nightmare

[Verse 2] I can feel this energy within me to fuck up anything in my path/ It’s a sudden thirst for destruction I wish I could hold back, but can’t fight the wrath/ I can’t control my emotion/ My mind done swung off the chain/ I’m unstable/ The rage that I had contained has spilled over/ Painted my landscape with pain/ This only means the end fast approaches/ There’s no way to brace for the impact, explosion/ Every direction I look turns to fire/ My humanity was so quick to expire/ I’m wired/ And you will be grabbing ya seats when the thrashing of beats meets gnashing of teeth/ And actually/ I ain’t behaved this way since the last time I smashed me a planet to pieces/ It’s over
