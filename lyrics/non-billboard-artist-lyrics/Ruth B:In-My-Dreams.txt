In-My-Dreams:Ruth B
[Verse 1]
The lights are bright tonight, the music loud
A perfect mess that's what surrounds me
Then I see you over there, I can't seem to break the stare
Maybe it's 'cause your shirt is my favorite color
Then you walk on over with a smolder
And you hand me your number, I say, "What is this?"
You say, "Love at first sight, it exists"
But I've had my heart broken so many times before
Yeah, I've walked through so many empty doors

[Chorus]
But if I see you in my dreams tonight
Then maybe you were right
And I'll call you in the morning
If I see you in my dreams tonight
And you take my hands and tell me
"I've been waiting for you"
Then I'll tell you, "Me too"
If I see you in my dreams tonight

[Verse 2]
I start to drive away and smile like I'm insane
How can I feel this way? I don't even know your name
The napkin doesn't say
Then I remember that I vowed not let anyone enter my heart
I say "What is this?"
I know love at first sight can't exist

[Chorus]
But if I see you in my dreams tonight
Then maybe you were right
And I'll call you in the morning
If I see you in my dreams tonight
And you take my hands and tell me
"I've been waiting for you"
Then I'll tell you, "Me too"
If I see you in my dreams tonight

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll meet in a different dimension
And you can tell me all the things you didn't mention
Maybe we'll meet in a different dimension
And you can tell me all the things you didn't mention
You'll say "What is this?"
I'll say "I guess love at first sight exists"

[Chorus]
Cause I saw you in my dreams that night
And I knew that you were right
So I called you in the morning
(In the morning, in the morning)
Yeah I saw you in my dreams that night
And you took my hands and told me
"I've been waiting for you"
And I told you, "Me too"
Yeah I saw you in my dreams that night
If I see you in my dreams tonight
