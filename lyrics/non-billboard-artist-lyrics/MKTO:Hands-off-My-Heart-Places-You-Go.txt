Hands-off-My-Heart-Places-You-Go:MKTO
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
Trying to get myself together but I'm losing my mind every second that I think of you
Stealing every single piece of me like lovin's a crime
It should be illegal, what you do
There's only so much I can take
I'd tried so hard, I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are, there you are
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
She's a man eater, dance gamer
Caught her on the bus with a bad leader
Good girl gone bad, so deceiving
Hot when she coming, cold leaving
Takin' what you wanna hear, too good to be true
Always heard about the warning, never thought it'd be you
Take-taking the chance, like I was the man, but she leaving with my heart in her hands
There's only so much I can take
I'd tried so hard, I can't escape
Your body's always in my way
There you are, there you are
Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
You got me tryin' to break free
But your hands on my heart got a hold of me
I don't know if this really how it's supposed to be
One minute cold
The way that you walk
The way that you talk
You got me laying bed in the streets surrounded by chalk
I knew what you was doing from the start, but can't stop
Squeezing with your hands around my heart ‘till it pop
Take your hands off, hands off, off me Take ‘em off me Baby, you don't even know it but you're leaving me in pieces
You take, you take, you take me apart
Baby, I surrender it's too late for me to get your
Hands off, hands off, get your hands off my heart
You can fall but baby don't get to close
Oh you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh's
Oh you might not like the places you go
Caught you by surprise, birthday
Caught you when you lie, the worst way
Now there's no disguise, you're thirsty
Every time I say goodbye, no mercy
I'm in the mercy, whiplashes I fly right past see you later
And what you can't see
Is that me living you is doing you a favor
Cause I can't beat it, trust in my words only cut like a razor, trust in my words just to feel like a vapor
I'm a real heartbreaker
You can fall but baby don't get to close
Oh you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh's
Oh you might not like the places you go
Tell me what you like, plain stare
What you want it like, don't care
Welcome to my mind, nightmare
You should run and hide, I don't play fair
You wanna play here, I'll make the rules that I want then I'll break them
Baby, stay clear, as soon as I'm done then I'm out and I'll blaze one
If you go beer, you started loving me, later you hate it
It's not my fault that you fell for me, baby
When I played you wasted
You can fall but baby don't get to close
Oh you might not like the places you go
You can smile with my heart in your hands
But you might not like the places we land
Oh's
Oh you might not like the places you go
(You would know, you would know)
Oh, you might not like the places you go
