Faster-Stronger:DJ Earworm
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I tried to send
My information's just not going in
I'm burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned off to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

I'm bulletproof, I'll be Bulletproof, fire away, fire away
Ricochet, I'll be Bulletproof, fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall, I am Titanium
Hit Me With Your Best Shot, fire away
I am Titanium
This time, baby, I'll be Bulletproof, fire away, fire away
This time, baby, I'll be Bulletproof, I am Titanium

We can make an Earthquake up in here
I Got The Power!
We can make an Earthquake up in here
Ladies and gentlemen
What you're about to witness is no illusion...
And now, we got the bass banging
From here to Buckingham Palace
They're all moving, fire away

I'm bulletproof
We can make an Earthquake up in here
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, I'll be Bulletproof, fire away, fire away
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
We can make an Earthquake up in here
I am Titanium
Shoot me down, but I won't fall
I'll be Bulletproof, I am Titanium, fire away

We can make an Earthquake up in here
Just mosh for me, yeah, mosh for me
Just mosh for me, yeah, mosh for me

This time, baby, this time, baby
This time, baby, this time...
This time, baby, this time, baby
This time, baby, this time...

This time, baby, I'll be Bulletproof
Fire away, fire away
This time, baby, I'll be Bulletproof
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall, I am Titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall, I am Titanium

We can make an Earthquake up in here
I am Titanium
We can make an Earthquake up in here
I am Titanium
