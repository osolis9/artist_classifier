Sun-Toucher:Bishop Lamont
I’m lookin at a nigga right now
It’s the look on his face
Upset, you don’t wanna know
But these darkies are about to go off the street

It’s the sun toucher, salivas a live erupture
Bicing out psycho cushion
My side illuminate the night like Luxor
Supreme being, meaning I’m meelo hemen
I mean knock and rebock but I stop and pop and leave you bleeding
We live from that zone where the real niggas roam
Might take a lot of shots oh Henny while creating a new room
Little very visionary, legendary already
Prisoner where my pen, I need more beats up than my commentary
Attempted jailbreak, only if my verses break
Recite a couple of more times to make sure the flow is great
Then I’m out, grab my hoodie, grab my hat
For any news immoments I’m first to gun clap
Yea I’m on the dangerous, a rebel rap terrorist
My middle finger linger for those who see us parish
From LA ghettos to every ghetto in the world
The last will be first, stay strong – that’s my word
We never stop, that’s the gift that God gave us
Voice of Paul Robertson, vision like Ozzie Davis
The soler and cabozy for these demons and you haters
My knuckle game illinear, rearrange your whole demeaner
My hooks is way cold but my kicks is even meaner

Body blows, you’re having internal bleeding flowing like Katrina
I’m the product of sensual conceder, bonified leader
Lines are legendary like the uniform of Derek Geeda
Punch lines so ralic, gotta rock a wife beater
Bitches eating out the palm of my hand, the bird feeder
I don’t ride with the meaner while I’m smoking on Keisha
Cuz at the meaner ride me I’ll be poking on Keisha
Well known speaker, got me bumping through your speakers
I have been the one before Krispa came to teach ya
Running the game while you chilling in the bleachers
This year tripling the prices of the features
The avangarde, wherever my voice reaches
It’s stily impregnable, inevitable bleachers
You poor rappers are so fesicious
But seriously sweeter than them Georgia peaches
Kept form the cloth who practice what he preaches
Suited up for war, and storming all your beaches
Your movement is coming to a hump, tie your screachers
Bedtime, you all retired, you weak bitches
The world is an oyster, ladies love curls
Got the muss burgledeck in case I have a little girl
I’m part analytical, learning to think critical
Either leave a mark or the people won’t remember you
The dream didn’t die with Martin Luther or Malcolm by the hands of they shooters
What we lost will retrude us for the revolution
All we left was this pollution
Contribute to the problem, well let’s talk about solutions
Niggas getting lost in my music, starting to think higher for success I aspire
Said they wanted dope, I confesses the supplier
This the king’s court, I address you as the squire
The better that you get, the more these niggas wanna try ya
Keep talkin shit, I’mma pass right by ya
I ride like James Book or play piano in the inno
Release one that charge before starting instrumentals of guilt

Right hand in the air, left hand on that book
Two fingers in the kitty, damn! It’s all that took
They calling me a beast, well grab me by the collar
Salty about a verse but hip don’t taller
Go ahead and get your buck on
Good on any corner, I feel like I wanna park on
Hop out, post up with an old timer
Back with evangelist, part time movie shiner
He keeps you 45 top stay applied
Moves left, fools worry about luck
I offer this advice when you’re down to pay the price
Stake em for every sense, they all have to pay it twice
Told em thanks, took tat strolled off
Nikita call off, Russians stick to that bottle of George Vicary squares run and get throwed off
And the alarm if you’re dozed off
Got balling ballzised nuts and not an ounce worth of fuck to be given
Your gender is hidden
Pay it no attention, they poking at my cage
Try and get ammention
Don’t get your head bit off
I’m a monster

Goddamn, can I say something?
Something honest
We hard than a motherfucker
Anyway, it’s your boy – Bishop Lamont
Woogie, don’t stop the record yet
I want all the emcees out there to go for this
So just let the beat rock
All my emcees go for yours
Off the top, no written
Nigga

Woogie play that shit
