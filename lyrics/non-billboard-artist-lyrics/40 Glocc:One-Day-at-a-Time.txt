One-Day-at-a-Time:40 Glocc
You can't stop my shine
You can hustle all you want
You can't [?] my rhyme
As a homey goofy break
To divine
[?] Fuck this rhyme
I'm gonna be some line
[?] just lame
It's the 34 blitz/bits
All the blacks keep tryin'
Keep a nice piece of arm baby
Even when you're riding
'Cause everywhere [?] been
A whole lot of dime
I hate to educate you
40 is still a [?]
[?]
Investigated, interrogated, hunted and bothered
I'm still keeping burning [?] problems
[?] I'm still the same old way
I'm gonna do what I got to
[?]

[Chorus:]
So when you see me in the streets
I'm getting money
When you see me with my girl
I'm getting money
When you see me in the club
Don't act funny
We're gonna stay in the [?]
One day at a time like
La-la la la la
We're in the hood like
La la la la la
We're felling good like
La la la la la
Living a good life
La la la la la

As long as it's women
Pennies gonna keep dropping
As long as I'm alive
Bottles will keep popping
Taking one day at a time
We'll see what we can capture
Read between the lines
The streets are watchin'
They say I got it popping
But it's not to my knowledge
They say I'm like a prophet
I'm just saying what I'm watching
When they'll see me dead broke
They'll lick my pocket
When they'll see me sniffing coc
Getting daddy
I'm a dynamite stick
Don't lick me [?]
My fuel is running short
[?] Fuck all of my tongue
Send the message to [?].
Rather dead or alive
Got a problem when you see me
Looking dead to my eyes
[?] all for exercise [?]
If you really wanna ride
Put the pistol to you [?] if you really wanna die
Taking of my mind
'Cause my mind just sky
But really I can see it in a vision
Shot blind [?]
Just cut the felony
Casing up the crime
Living life two step
One day at a time

[Chorus]
