Gold-Dust-Radio-Edit:DJ Fresh
It's like gold dust
You hear me coming through your speakers
You see me mashing up your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

It's like gold dust
You hear me coming through your speakers
You see me blagging off your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

There's no place to hide, so stop the fight, I'm gonna get it
No use running from me, baby, you're gonna regret it
I can't understand why you can free yourself and let it
Go, go, go, go

Got you in my palm, now listen good, you can't escape it
Bring her to my world and we'll just see if you can take it
Don't you be afraid, I know you're strong enough to make it
Go, go, go

It's like gold dust
You hear me coming through your speakers
You see me mashing up your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

It's like gold dust
You hear me coming through your speakers
You see me blagging off your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

Everything in your life you've been searching for's in this direction
Come a little closer, don't you feel the intersection?
We gon' take it down, and then we gonna keep you sweatin'
Don't go, go, go

Take a tour around, you never know it's nonexistent
You won't hear it coming no matter how hard you listen
Can't predict the hard way we bring our position
Go, go, go

I don't know where you are from, what you're running from, oh
I don't know where you are from, what you're running from, oh
I don't know where you are from, what you're running from, oh
All you want from your present life

Baby put your hands up in the air, I know you like it
Don't you fight since I can see how you're now excited
Flying through the night, we're going up and tight it
Go, go, go, go

Now we got the style and energy that you desire
Let me see you jump around, come with me, let's go higher
Climbing up the speakers, we gon' set this place on fire
Go, go, go

It's like gold dust
You hear me coming through your speakers
You see me mashing up your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

It's like gold dust
You hear me coming through your speakers
You see me blagging off your airwaves
I know you can't get enough of my sound

You keep runnin' and you're runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're running away, away, away, boy
You keep runnin' and you're runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're running away, away, away
You keep runnin' and you're runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're running away, away, away, boy
You keep runnin' and you're runnin' and you're runnin'
And you're running away, don't go, go, go
