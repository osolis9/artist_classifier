Sitting-in-Limbo:Jimmy Cliff
Sitting here in Limbo, but I know it won't be long
Sitting here in Limbo, like a bird without a song
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting here in Limbo, waiting for the dice to roll
Sitting here in Limbo, got some time to search my soul
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I don't know where life will lead me
But I know where I've been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I've seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
But all that is passed and gone
This little boy is moving on

Sitting here in Limbo, waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in Limbo, knowing that I have to go
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I've seen
I don't know where life will lead me
But I know where I've been
Tried my hand at love and friendship
But all that is passed and gone
This little boy is moving on

Sitting here in Limbo, waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in Limbo, knowing that I have to go
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting in Limbo, sitting in Limbo
Sitting in Limbo, sitting in Limbo
Sitting in Limbo, sitting in Limbo
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo
Sitting in Limbo, sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo
Sitting in Limbo, sitting in Limbo
Sitting in Limbo, sitting in Limbo
