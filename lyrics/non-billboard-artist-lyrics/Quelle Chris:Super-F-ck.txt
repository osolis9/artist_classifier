SUPER FUCK
Working on my biceps
In between the laps doing pushups
Shake weight till I gush up
Pour me some orange crush, throw me some orange kush up
Decathlon, we did our thing
She was gassed up, I made that canary sing
SUPER FUCK

Working on my caps
Lift her up, fuck her like an eight
It's only going to the whole rocker in the paint
You wanna lose weight, sweat it out
You want that summer body, you know how to go about it
Scream and shout it, Bailey's at Bali's
The heavy weight getting deep in your cavities
Do some squats on it, that's the murder game
She was gassed up, I made that canary sing
SUPER FUCK

Working on them abs
Put them lax round my head
Make that man crunch up
Been a reserved breakfast, desert, brunch up
What a plate
Make me wanna yelp that
Shit is great, threw my hands up
Climax, great escape
No lines at all, ride everything
She was gassed up, I made that canary sing
SUPER FUCK

SUPER FUCK
SUPER FUCK
SUPER FUCK

Super fuck
Super fuck

Real bud
I'm searching for that real bud
Something to set my mind, bring real bud
I'm searching for that real bud
