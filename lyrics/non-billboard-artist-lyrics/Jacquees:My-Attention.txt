DJ Spin!
She ain't scared to go
She ain't scared to go
And she ain't scared to go
Go, go, go, go
She just moved to Atlanta
Stayed in Alabama
Graduated high-school, now she's living life on the go, go, go
With nowhere to go, go, go
So I pick her up when she come in town
I reach for her hand, but she shut it down
I didn't know, know, know
That I was so caught, caught, caught!
I'm just young and I'm begging, I'm running for all of your love
Don't end it, cause baby I need you, remember my touch
And these problems that I share them, I swear that I'm trying to last
All I see is your... when I look at into the dust
She ain't scared to go
She ain't scared to go
And she ain't scared to go
Go, go, go, go!
.and she's good to go
She working and she twirking, acting magic on that pole
And that's why ain't no chick better
Say they don't call her, drop a cannon
I say girl I gotta choose, baby let me make you wetter!
Sweat been dripping down your spine like you're in a sweater
If I touch you wrong, and touch me right,
she'll. and do it better
If I had to choose... I'll be on Patron and juice
She's been on the game and loose
Can't wait to getting you!
I'm just young and I'm begging, I'm running for all of your love
Don't end it, cause baby I need you, remember my touch
And these problems that I share them, I swear that I'm trying to last
All I see is your... when I look at into the dust
She ain't scared to go
She ain't scared to go
And she ain't scared to go
Go, go, go, go!
What was she doing, .ease your mind
She made me believe she was mine
And I'm wasting my time, cause she was trained to go
Cause she isn't like the rest, man, I should have known!
I'm thinking about you, I can't get you out my mind
I'm thinking about you, I can't get you out my mind
I'm thinking about you, I can't get you out my mind
I'm thinking about you, I can't get you out my mind
I'm just young and I'm begging, I'm running for all of your love
Don't end it, cause baby I need you, remember my touch
And these problems that I share them, I swear that I'm trying to last
All I see is your... when I look at into the dust
She ain't scared to go
She ain't scared to go
And she ain't scared to go
Go, go, go, go!
