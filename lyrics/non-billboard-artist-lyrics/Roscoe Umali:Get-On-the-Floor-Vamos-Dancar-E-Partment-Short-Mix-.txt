We party all night
Come on and get it right
We're gonna party non-stop girl like it's just you and I
We do it all night
‘Cause it just feels right
Let's go, just shake yo body now baby
(Let's go)
Shake it, shake it shake shake it girl
Oh oh get on the floor
Oh oh I'm moving up
Oh oh give me some more
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh oh get my party on
Oh oh I'm burning up
Oh oh dance all night long
Uno-dos-tres-quatro

La la la la la la la la la la…

Make it, get it like I play for the Lakers
It's all about the paper
Me, I'm bout the cream, my baby color green
I remember when I used to have them triple beam dreams
Crash go pick it up but see you in dream machine
It's all about the dough hoe
Looks like I'm trippin lanes so I ride slow hoe
LBC MIAMI, LBC, ML

Like when she shake it, shake it
She push it back on me like she wanna break it, break it
Hands all over my body girl
I know you like this, girl
So come and get it girl
I'm like a rocket, girl
This is my private world

Oh oh get on the floor
Oh oh I'm moving up
Oh oh give me some more
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh oh get my party on
Oh oh I'm burning up
Oh oh dance all night long

La la la la la la la la la la…

This is my general space, guru place
I'm on that stick with that bass
And my heart beats like a drum
You know always love your mom
Get it right, get it well
DJ pump it in my brain
Dance and we will never stop
We wanna party, party rock
