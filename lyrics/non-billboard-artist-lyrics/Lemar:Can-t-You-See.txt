Can-t-You-See:Lemar
Can't you see I love you, baby? Gotta
  (Lemar, Styles P, the Ghost, let's go)

Since back in the day, we've been close friends
You would call on me tellin' me your problems
I'd been feelin' things, things I never said
When you said that you were in love, wish it was me instead

I'd treat you like an angel, he treats you like a fool
When you were hurtin', baby, I was broken too
(I can't go on this way)
And I can't go on, I need you, baby

Tired of being the shoulder you lean on
Wanna be the one you hold on to
More than just a friend, let me be your everything

Wish I knew the way to make you
See that I've fallen in love with you, oh
  (Can't you see I love you, baby? Gotta)

If I sit you down, tell you what I'm going through
Will you leave him, will it be too much for you?
Don't wanna be an addition to your situation
I never wanna be a complication

But if I see you cry, I'm stepping in
I can't keep watching you get your heart broken, hey
  (I can't go on this way)

Tired of being the shoulder you lean on
Wanna be the one you hold on to
More than just a friend, let me be your everything

Wish I knew the way to make you
See that I've fallen in love with you, oh
  (Can't you see I love you, baby? Gotta)
Let's go, Lemar, yeah

I ain't never said that I loved you
More than the friend that put nothin' above you
And I could be more than the shoulder you lean on
I could be your king, little lady, you'd be gettin' your queen on

It hurt me every time I seen him hurt you
Thinkin' 'bout these feelings got me runnin' in circles
(I can't go on this way)
I love your mind, body and soul and even your perfume

Tired of being the shoulder you lean on
Wanna be the one you hold on to
More than just a friend, let me be your everything

Wish I knew the way to make you
See that I've fallen in love with you, oh
  (Can't you see I love you, baby? Gotta)

Tired of being the shoulder you lean on
Wanna be the one you hold on to
More than just a friend, let me be your everything

Wish I knew the way to make you
See that I've fallen in love with you, oh
  (Can't you see I love you, baby? Gotta)

Whenever you're down, a mess
I will be there, baby, I will lift you up when
When there's trouble, girl

Look over your shoulders, honey
When there's trouble, you can count on me, oh
  (Can't you see I love you, baby?)
