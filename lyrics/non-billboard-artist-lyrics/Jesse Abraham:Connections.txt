Connections:Jesse Abraham
f/ Jeanette Berry


[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
I heard you said that you alone	
You at home
In your bed
It's not true at all
You know feelings of dread, they run through us all
You see them obstacles run through em all
Yeah, screw a wall
Nothing can hold me back
Show me that stranger and I'll show you homies that know me for a
minute, a second, a friggin moment
We own it
Our eyes are moldin
We zonin
Ain't no alone and we knowin the culture's growing
Ain't nothing slowin
it's 4 in the morning, and I still want the microphone and I'm still goin in
Ok if you got a towel then you throw it in
Ok if you got a scowl time to grow a grin
No pretending sentence
Relentless
It goes unmentioned unless if it's in a sense of suspension you learn
a lesson no matter the session
We all connected like tetris etcetera
Literally
I'm you
You're me
We're connected

[Hook: Jeanette Berry]
There may be moments when you feel alone, it's true
Life might not be on time
I'll always do the best for you
Believe in trust, that's just the way we do

[Verse 2: Jesse Abraham]
I don't believe in a paradox
Some people imitate the same way a parrot talks
I come correct with more props than Carrot Top
I'm a triceratops
My nonsense never stops
You think your life is different?
Whether rabbi or reverend
You know we're all connected
I hear all your suggestions
Say you wanna hear me rappin slow
Here we go now with the crack free flow
Givin me questions back and forth
What in the world are you askin for?
In Orlando like a Backstreet bro
No doja in your dojo?
Oh no
Yo
Crows in Dumbo seen a elephant fly
“Can't tell if he's a mellow or intelligent guy”
I play the cello smooth as caramellos in the sky
With propellers and elevators and escalators
I'm so - hi mom
Yeah she's chillin with me too on this planet that I'm on

[Hook – Jeanette Berry]
Let your spirit shine
Through the darkest time
We've all been there before
And we're worth so much more

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
When we're apart we're still a part of each other
When we're apart we're still a part of each other
When we're apart we're still a part of each other
When we're apart
A part a part a part
A part of me is inside you
Hard to see but it is true
Pardon me for partially imparting thoughts original
It's critical to listen to ideas that aren't visible
We're indivisible
I know the ritual's dismissing new or different
Ain't nobody different
What're you sniffin?
Whatchu been piffin?
Actually the fact is no matter what is the pattern of Saturn they're
only manners of action
You know we're scattered like scrabble pieces
Unleashing the thesis, jesus, nephews or nieces
We as cohesive as pieces of pizza greases onto a napkin
So what happens when laughin is viewed as a distraction
When it's a sign of passion
There's no maskin the fact that we're one in the same
You mumble my name
The same thang as sayin your own
Deviations blow away in the cold
Breakin the mold is what I'm doin you and me we ain't so different
