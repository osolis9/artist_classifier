(feat. T-Pain)

Lets go

I'm from the city where we ride tall
Tag them all get fresh to a tea hit the club and bawl
Go stupid dumb dumb
Hit the strip club make it rain what
Got lil t pain and me
Inside do it when I got anything to me
So up top where da goose at
To this ride I
To the spot where da girls get loose at
To the spot where they hot and they choose it
Not the spot where they hot and them fools at
To the spot where they ready to go
The question everybody care cuz they already know

When I'm in the strip club I get love for about 500 dollars
Y Y Y Y Yes indeed anything you need for about 500 dollars
I'll make it rain (make it rain)
they say you the man...(You da man ya)
It's the let out part, get out c'mon get your 500 dollars in ones
it's time to ball out

And where them womans at
One go one stay went pole went stack on the whole set
Oh she doin it lovin when i come through
The way I make it rain all the change when I come through
Me JC drey and the whole crew
BS Gotta make broadway and her too
Besides G dude make a brother beg
Hit the flo just dont throw it out by the sex
I got her rollin poppin pills
But she got me throwin dollar bills
Pretty young thing with sex appeal
Got my man on stiff like he's made of steel

When I'm in the strip club I get love for about 500 dollars
Y Y Y Y Yes indeed Anything you need for about 500 dollars
I'll make it rain (make it rain)

It's the let out part, get out cmon get your 500 dollars in ones

I don't know about you but I came to BALL
Tip back to sip drinks till they say last call
Lookin back at me facin the wall
Make her drop it down low till she 2 feet tall
And I call her ms. new booty
500 more better bring it back to me
Makin it rain george and benjamins
They rubbin on each other strawberry and cinnamon

What you see guaranteed to make you fall I
Get you warm in the spot my nigga time to bawl out
