Not-For-You:Zug Izland
(Joe Bruce Talking)
Let me start off just by saying this
Any likeness to a certain Pearl Jam song is purely,
Purely speculation today brother
Lets do this Zug
(Verse 1)
Juggalo, Enjoy your youth
Like your pop said it??™s a truth
I can't escape from the common rule
If you hate something, Don't you do it too, Don??™t you, Don??™t you
Small my table, a sits just two
Violent J and some scrub Joe Bruce
All these ninjas storm a room
And you dare say one belongs to you, Not true
(Hook)
This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Never was for you
Fuck you
(Bridge)
Your all symbols so much better
Your not jealous so much better
Your all symbols so much better
Your not jealous YEAH
(Verse 2)
All that's sacred comes from youth
Dedication, Clown love is true
With no power, What can I do
But there are some who well except Joe Bruce
Joe Bruce this is just for you
This is just for you
This is just for you
This is just for you
This is just for you
(Whole bunch of rambling)
(Outro)
Mike P??™s fingers are bleeding in there damn
Ashley done broke 500 drum sticks
Gwedo broke his bass over Dan millers head
Motherfuckers tore the studio up
Much love to Juggalos
Zug Izland and Joe Bruce
Shaggy and Psychopathic family
Yeah
