Blessings:Visionaries
2Mex) 
 Subtle, signifying sonnets 
 Not unlike low flying comets 
 Evolving to love is loving to revolve 
 Revolvers releasing the round revolutions 
 Entering earthlings, ending evolution 
 Decision is the devil so I choose flakiness 
 I refuse to exist in a life? 
 Return to natural life empowered, 
 Futuristic flows from an unidentified flowered 

 (Dannu) 
 Fasten your heartfelt fast when I'm askin 
 Burned spotlights, human sized microscope 
 Keep the rhyme tight and dope, enough to choke 
 Invisible mics in a circle full of hope 
 The list of fist signs, the punch and quest times 
 Seize food for fighters, lunch plus for dinner, 
 Six winners plus a snack, we packed up wise 
 Another blessing in disguise, hiphop be our guide 
 The fact we push deep ground beats when we speak 
 Pass a test that'll vest and not cheat under heat 
 Well resin has spoken word, heard you wrote herb, 
 It's that crew, nice to meet you, very well served 

 HOOK: (8 bars on the turntables) 
 Bless the mic, Ble-Bless the mic, Ble-Bless the mic for the god 

 (Lord Zen) 
 Locked deep within the self-consciousness lies the bad seed 
 When at least I seep through the cries to disturb the peace 
 You can't get this dope without a prescription, 
 Over the counter versions fell grade to addiction 
 Left to trail eviction from here to hell's kitchen 
 Me bein vain, people in chains without a conviction 
 Who says you're saved by the goods that you practice 
 So involved in the scriptures you read, you lost your head like John the 
 Baptist 
 Right side of the brain cripples you like arthritis, 
 Who do you know that'll rock a verse with laryngitis? (coughing) 

 (Key Kool) 
 In my Caprice Classic, thoughts concoct 
 Tape deck broken, I got the boombox 
 Listenin to musical ink blots brought 
 By the funky president J Rocc who's settin shop 
 Plot developed, from the previous night 
 Wake Up Show duo, Kobe Bryant on the mic 
 I was like it's only right for a collaboration 
 By consolidated members of the crew affiliations 
 Visionaries. . . Beat Junkies. . . 
 What's up to the force hanging out in the trees 
 Conglomerated musical expressions, 
 Times like these, I appreciate the blessings
