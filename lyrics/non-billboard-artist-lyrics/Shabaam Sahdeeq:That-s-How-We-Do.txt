That-s-How-We-Do:Shabaam Sahdeeq
That's how we do...
That's how we do...
That's how we do...
That's how we do...

Yeah, O-Negative, yaknowha'msayin
Puttin these hot tracks down, yaknowha'msayin
All day, every day, yaknowha'msayin
We got that Henny, we got that haze, knowha'msayin
We got the broads over here, knowha'msayin
They got on the tight skinwear, knah'mean
Chillin up in the parks, chillin in the cars
Blast music... Y'all fools don't got no handle,
Y'all don't know what to do with that ball
Pass that.

Pass the peel, y'all fools can't score for Will
Raw is the deal, ya face hit the floor like heels
I paid my dues, while y'all hurts play the fool
Display my tool, fix whatever problem you got
Fuck ya beats, my clique got majors tracks
Like ya trick weave and bobbie pins, shit that could wrap
Our elevator chops it up like helicopter propellers
S-Double the mozzarella, free my peeps like Mandela
Respect me duke, and I do the same for you
G'head, play Mr. Toughy, getcha head unscrewed
I know made men who move llel, but you sayin they new
Pop toast in every rhyme, whatchu sayin ain't true
I come through boppin 'em, with Myers Rum
Face twist, think about where my next meal comin from
Don't roll ya hands up, just focus ya mind and listen
Without the rocks I glisten, what I'm spittin,
Gotchu niggaz pissin in ya pants standin in the puddle
In the huddle I'm bound to bubble
When my drink drop niggaz in trouble

In trouble man, yaknowha'mean (In trouble kid)
S-Double smoke somethin, streets know
Shabaam Sahdeeq (That's what?)
That's how we do, get busy (That's what?)
Uh. niggaz in BK
95 send 'em all niggaz (That's what?)
Flatbrush beatin and Westbury beats
Holla (Smash 'em!) knahmean?
Bed-Stuy, Hart, Costiasco niggaz
(Yo let these magazine...)

I'm holdin a ace, holdin my place, holdin a eight
Ball; for them niggaz that crack like sidewalks
Money talks, you'll be on a vacation with Mr. Rawk'
On Fantasy Isle, that's why we stay poundin you out
I'm out for the gold, out for the plaque, out for the map
I'm takin it over, with a black holster strapped to the shoulder
Watch ya step, quiet as kept, fuck ya rep
I'm leavin 'em wet like seals and snatchin their meal
Uncompromise and we got the fuel
To keep the track pumpin like lifer dudes
In yard nigga, fix ya face
All that hate radiates when you step in the place
At the dorm at LIU, blunts and brews
Two chicks, my mind off from rival crews
Me and Pablo, pimp game, hiked 'em up
Right to fuck, two latex lay in the cup
They was already drunk, ready to get they perms sweated out
And she said nothin when I put it in her mouth
Yeah I stay poker faced, when I'm smokin a mocha
And I keep bitches happy like diamond chokers

We ain't trickin, feel me shorty?
Uh, hahah...
Yeah, my Jersey niggaz, my E.O. niggaz
My T-Neck niggaz, yeah, my Sack niggaz
Englewood niggaz, Jersey City up on the hill niggaz
Newark niggaz, Ervington niggaz, Monteclair niggaz.
You feel me, summertime, wintertime
We out there all year 'round
Yeah, you know how we do, my Bronx niggaz
176th Street niggaz, knahm'sayin
My Mt. Hoke niggaz, my Walton niggaz
My East Treemont niggaz, yo my Cedric niggaz
My Riverpark Tower niggaz, yeah holla.
