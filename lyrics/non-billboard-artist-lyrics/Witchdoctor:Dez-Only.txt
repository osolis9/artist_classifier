Dez-Only:Witchdoctor
Deep in the steaming jungle
The eerie sound of the voodoo drums tell us that
This is the night
My confess, we sinners Lord
Dez only 1

Book you got cooked
Book, you got cooked
Book, you got cooked

God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book, you got cooked
Book, you got cooked
Book, you got cooked, uh

God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book, you got cooked
Book, you got cooked

Check it out, uh
If in this life I strive to please Him
In this day and night
I'm not always right

Even when I'm wrong
You should be afraid to anger Him
'Cause you could be gone, Him don't need us
It's the other way round

Do you know what I'm talking about
When I say Him, clown?
You can't look at nobody and say that's Him
'Cause He's invisible, yet visible, this is critical

Relying on our own abilities you lose
You need Him to help make your bumpy ride a cruise
Ask magic about Him or any strong believer
He's the quarterback, we the receivers

Catching blessings
Better than touchdowns
I seek Him when
Niggaz wanna buck me down

Him holds many holy titles
Him has many names, Him has many Bibles
The devil can't deal with him, uh
He tempted me but you see, I'm still with Him

Listen close, all brothers are men
Him is responsible for all colors and kin
I bust with Him, if only I can fully trust in Him
I'm glad to be stuck with Him

Rather have Him than money, I'm serious
He'll get you once you become curious
Lord, give me happy long life
Real good sex with the wife
No traveling with bodyguards
It's just a real nigga godly entourage

God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book, you got cooked
Book, you got cooked
Book, you got cooked

See my relationship with the God is kind of odd
The nigga, the B I G won't part
Feeling the presence up in my heart

But never no chicken to the nigga
In on that style like that
Talking about the way the Lord
Be lifting these burdens up off my back

Better that I bust raps or better that I cut that
Ho you couldn't
You trying too hard, you better find Him
I'm hoping you understood it, could it be, what?

The niggaz around the way
Don't really be thinking about the consequences
Under the circumstances

Until you pinch them
Then a nigga be one to listen, why?
'Cause you woke that ass up, yoke that ass up
Proving the Man in the sky that holds that ass up

But it's over now, He cut off
Some niggaz done broke you clean off
But got to get on your knees
And praise the only, now your soul lost

Now, okay, now, the sun shines
The moon glows, the wind blows
The rain falls but that ain't all
My heart thumps on a rhythm y'all

And birds call
And two can fall madly in love
Oh, I think grow

They stop and stare in awe
Because we in His likeness
Hoping and praying that one day
In the lab they might just

Stumble on some kind of way
To create human beings
So far human kind is the only thing I'm seeing
