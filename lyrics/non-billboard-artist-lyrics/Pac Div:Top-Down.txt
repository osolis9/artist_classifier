Top-Down:Pac Div
Shout out to my thick girls, thick girls
You tha shit girl, shit girl
With them hips girl, hips girl
Got a mixed girl with curls
Got me a rich girl with pearls
You don't wanna ? better than my big girl, big girl
Come get this dick girl, dick girl
Better cum quick girl, quick girl
I like girls who come with girls and I like girls who cut with girls
It's too easy, I'm too sleazy
Drinking Fiji, watching TV
I'm as nice as BBCC
Why these girls pee pee when we be
Rhyming, you see me I'm rocking diamonds
With my ? I be grinding
BXB and we be shining
2-seater bitch, we reclining
Top down, armor all'd up
Got that brown up in my cup
Got that bomb fired up

Top that Breitling for the Hublot
Boy I got nothing but time
And I tell her mom to keep her ?
Show my dick what's on her mind
Lemme get that head! Lemme get that head!
Girl I need that head
Screaming Eagle, wold forever
I sip that purple and bleed that red
Niggas know wassup, these girls wanna fuck
Well me? I'm on that same shit
? call me Mr. Never-Seen-With-The-Same-Bitch
Swear I had a Polo out in Soho smoking skunk
And I had 4 hoes in that 4-door with my .44 in the trunk
Underground niggas, independent getting checks tho
Boy I spit that sick shit, flow like I got strep throat
Duke and Pac Divvy, we get busy, we get ?
Girl you in the presence of the king: bear witness

Top down, yeah I'm the man
I'm from LA, I got that juice and I got a plan
Girls just drop in I drop the roof
We get a tan
So when you see me, I'll be speeding
With my head out the window screaming: Top Down!

I spent a hundred dollars on me
Finna head straight to the store
Smoking on that headband, it goes straight to your skull
Lincoln Continental flow, player player ?
These niggas finna hate, and that list is gonna be long
Just been in my chromosome
? Home Alone
Corvette's your rolling stone
Zip boy fresh they know they wrong
And I got guess in my cologne
She be guessing wrong
When niggas cut you short, make sure your checks is long
It's that upper eschelon
Rambo with ammo. Fat boy shit
Had them niggas rocking camo
Cold-blooded mammal but the bitches keep me warm
They only doing shit that they seen in a song

[Hook]

I don't got nothing to prove
It's that ? that's cool
? say I'm to cool
But I guess some girls get fooled
Cause this young nigga that do
Riding around with my crew
