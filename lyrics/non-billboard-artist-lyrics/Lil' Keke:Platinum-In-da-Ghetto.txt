Platinum-In-da-Ghetto:Lil' Keke
Livin' my dreams
If they could see me now
See me now, oh yeah

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

P L A T I N U M
People in the 'hood for real you ought to see them
I know I must do what I can
It's the same place that took me from a boy to a man
Give it all back, only just to see us come up
Ya'll the same niggas that use to watch the laws run up
Now we concentrate on tryna be grown men
Watchin' the earth turn feelin the world spin

It's a mad psalm, tryin' to do it on your own
One day you're here and the next day gone
The sky waits for no one, I know you heard that
Everything is bad when you're broke plus black
I'm dedicated, unto my Lord I pray
Can't see the future livin' day for day
I'm workin' heard, tryin' to platinum charts
In the ghetto my hood, I've touched a million hearts, come on

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

My neighborhood hero, 80 or number 0
Get yours and get own for real, that's all I know
Live your dream because it's somethin' to see
And the best thing happenin' is alive and free
I took the cash money and started slicin' and cuttin'
'Cause I swear that this game ain't gon' promise you nothin'
It's a circumstance that we all go through
Some things is fake nigga, something's true

I recognize that I've been down forever
Time to pull the family up and try to do it together
I got no where to run and no where to hide
My false is my worst so I'm stuck with pride
'Cause the women and the cars, it don't equal the wealth
So I'm all about my cash, tryin' to impress myself
'Cause the man make the money, money don't make the man
If you feel what I'm sayin' then raise your right hand

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

It's a hard life so I'm takin' it slow
That's the G H to the E to the T T O
On a long road but I'ma ride to die
And if you thuggin' then you know just what I'm talkin' about
It's a epidemic so I take it to the limit
The hood off the chain, them folks, they still in it

You see me now and I ain't goin' too far
I got love for my people, man, whoever you are
So I'ma take it back then I'ma bring it up
I ain't the only nigga out here dodgin' bad luck
Try to feel me before I let you go and it's forever and a day
We platinum in da ghetto, in da ghetto

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

I'm tryin' to give back to the hood
And you see Billy Cook and Lil'ke tryin' to do somethin' good
We tryin' to give somethin' back to you, and you, and you
Livin' my dream if they could see me now, oh me now

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

Livin' my dreams 'cause it's all I know
Keep my head up everywhere I go
Makin' my cash, baby, that's for sure
Come on, they got me, platinum in da ghetto

Well I respect it, yeah
Oh, livin' my dreams, if they could see me now
