they wouldn't think ya for real
now i understand my plan
to be more than a rap musician
jesus got me on a mission
why some demons come up missin
the rythmn, this world keep curvin
my dog grew up in church
now he's headbusta killa
think thats something
the devils tryin to murder us all
but a soldier like me
gonna spritual ball, til i fall
send the demons to the mall
rebuke the generation curse, pray for all my dog's
this world done spook you out
if you ain't livin for god

divided for the lord
all the money in the world
cant stop whats about to happen
look wody quite all your at, take head

when the nuke's hummin
this world won't breathe because
armageddon's steady comin

they tryin to do me wrong
but look ya'll hold my own
i have some feelings from wicked dealings
with people just disguisin their evil like the oracle
i peep the devil hes caniving
working through somebody backslidin
check for hypocrites ridin
i check my destiny
them demons tryin to capture me
armageddon, tribulation

so we might be taken up
mysterious ways
dead people wakin up
