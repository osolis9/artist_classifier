As-One:LongShot
As One/is when we'll get much stronger/we can't get much wronger/I need 2 get my life and my money right/the funny types/they always telling jokes when they holding mics/but not me/cuz Shot be/throwing them stones/like my name was Roc C/I got beef if you giving in/live 4 ya kids/instead of dying 4 a grand/or getting locked in the pen/again/man what you hating for?/waiting for another 2 put you on aint gone make it boy/take it boy from the floor 2 the roof as proof/that you can make something out of nothing/and that's the truth/like the crisis of blacks dying too young by gun/or babies having babies/we 2 unite as one before we're done/let's all get a raise/when we rise to enterprise and gain before they're eyes


I pray that painful days be through/as long as we remain untrue/we wont break away/let's unite/and all fight(As One!)

We need 2 come together/As One(repeat)

As One/United States of America/as one Chicago ILL here to build it up/as one globe for world peace/girl I know it hurts/be strong/it's gone cease/when our fathers who plant em/raise they seed right/be the sunshine that they need/believe to see the light/be the spark to their fire that adds fuel 2 the flame/in a positive way/hey let's make a change/strange days when we still live like slaves 4 a chain/stave the pain like a wrestler/working the frame/and know the rain gone remain when black clouds over hang/be your own silver lining/yal know the saying/so many days spent trying to be more than poor/we cant afford a seat on the floor/so reach for em/explore this "E"/vote for sure/do something about/don't just hope for a cure
