Boom-Ditty:Rev Run
I got rhymes so def and rhymes galore
Rhymes that you never even heard before
It's like this y'all, it don't stop
It's the sure shot

People want me rhymin' must be out of they mind
They say I do it well and my rhymes are so fly
Gotta lot of bottom and my highs are so high
And when I tell 'em I don't wanna they just wanna know why

With a boom ditty, ditty with the ditty the drum
The kiddies lookin' for me cause they lookin' for Run
I'm all up in the city, but you know where I'm from

The H to the O, double-L I S
I know the boom batter 'bout to shatter your chest
The beater leader heater 'bout to make you go numb
With a boom ditty, ditty, ditty, ditty, ditty, ditty

Boom ditty, ditty with the ditty the drum
Boom, boom ditty, ditty boom ditty, boom ditty, ditty
Boom ditty, ditty with the ditty the drum
The kiddies lookin' for me 'cause they lookin' for Run
Boom ditty, ditty with the ditty the drum

Now I'm up and down the boule' and I'm fully aware
People lookin' for me and they want me to care
They all up in my business and they thinkin' it's fair
Can't a brother just retire, throw his mic in the air?

I pass it up to Diddy and the kiddies to come
My mic up in the kitty, no more rhymin' for Run
Like a be-boy bangin' slangin' son of a gun
A gold chain hangin', no more bangin' for Run
Boom swagger' top bragger' battle badder for me

y'all beg a top batter make a fatter LP
The Rev'll never do it 'less I do it for delf
I gotta letcha have it, go and manager yourself
Your army can't harm me, it ain't good for your health
So it's best y'all pass it on and put the mic on the shelf with a

Boom ditty, ditty with the ditty the drum
Boom, boom ditty, ditty boom ditty, boom ditty, ditty
Boom ditty, ditty with the ditty the drum
The kiddies lookin' for me 'cause they lookin' for Run
Boom ditty, ditty with the ditty the drum

Rhymin' for my momma and the drama to come
Rhymin' for Bambaataa and I'm rhymin' for Run
Rhymin' for my people up and under the gun
And when I'm rhymin' for the money people know that it's
Done, done, done, done, done
