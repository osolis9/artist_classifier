What do girls want?
a heart to haunt
a little repetition
to cut the superstition

All the pretty, pretty horses
have all gone away
(I'm gonna make you see)
overdue premonitions
of yesterday
(that you belong to me)

You can't make my
mouth move this time

I think a little repetition
would be good for me
(I'm gonna make you play)
I can see in three dimensions
what's gonna be
(I'm gonna get my way)

You can't make my
ears bleed this time

What do girls want?
a heart to haunt
a little repetition
to cut the superstition

And all the pretty, pretty horses
have all gone away

You can't make my
mouth move this time
