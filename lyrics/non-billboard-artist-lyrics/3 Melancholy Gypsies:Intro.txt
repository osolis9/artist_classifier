Intro:3 Melancholy Gypsies
I'm just a gypsy who gets paid
For all the songs that I have played
And all the records that I have made
I'm part of a caravan
I have travelled on the land
Making music for my fellow man
And every song I played or wrote
With a sad or happy note
Some are made to make you laugh
Some are made to make you cry
I don't know the reason why
But I'll continue to travel
But I'll continue to travel
Though my guitar's old and tiring fast
She just listens to me
Her music means more to me than any other woman
I have known
She just listens to me
Her music means more to me than any other woman
I have known
And I'll continue to travel though my guitar's old and
tiring fast
She just listens to me
Her music means more to me than any other woman
I have known
She just listens to me
Her music means more to me than any other woman
I have known
