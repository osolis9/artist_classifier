Something-Better:Phlake
When I'm caught up in sense making
I tend to go too far
I just go on and on guessing
to find a reason why

I want something better
to affect me now (affect me now)
To put in big bold letters
before I get down (before I get down)

I think I need a teacher
to lean on against
before I move along alone

A friend I wanna keep here
to fly all the way
No I don't wanna settle for less

I want something better
something better mm
I want I want something better

When I catch myself breaking down
My body in despair
I don't listen to all the hidden sounds
I'm yelling I don't care

Cuz I want something better
to affect me now (affect me now)
To put in big bold letters
before I get down (before I get down)

I think I need a teacher
to lean on against
before I move along alone

A friend I wanna keep here
to fly all the way
No I don't wanna settle for less

I want something better
something better mm
I want I want something better

I'm tryna break up with my
decision making
Yeah, you know me
Yeah, you know

I'm tryna wake up my blind
patient take 'em
Yeah, you know me
Yeah, you know

I think I need a teacher
to lean on against
before I move along alone

A friend I wanna keep here
to fly all the way
No I don't wanna settle for less

Something better
I want I want something
Something better

It's turning me up and I know
I want something better
Something better

It's turning me up now
and I want I want something better
Something better

It's turning me up and I know
It's turning me up now
