Something-Say:Knine
Say something, I'm giving up on you
im sorry that i couldnt get to you
(dont appeal to you)
I ll be(am) the one ...if you want me to
(dont you want me to)
Anywhere I would've followed you
And I... I'm feeling so small

It was over my head

I know nothing at all

And I. will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
im starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would've followed you
Say something I'm giving up on you
And I... will swallow my pride
You're the one that I want
And im saying goodbye
(you dont feel the same)
Say something I'm giving up on you
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
