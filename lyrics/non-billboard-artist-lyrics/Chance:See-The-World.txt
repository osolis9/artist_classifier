See-The-World:Chance
Standing on a mountain, I can see the world
Bright under the moonlight, I can't describe it with words
Enjoying it forever, keeping it together, can't I stay here?
I step out of the dark and all becomes light, it's better than a dream!

Cause, when I can see the world,
I feel like having the power in my hands,
I've got control of all in my life!
When I can see the world,
I feel like having the power in my hands,
I've got control of all, all, all…
I used to have some problems, but now they are all solved
They were like two big towers that didn't let me walk
Now everything is better, no more stormy weather, can't I stay here?
It's time to forget, to change the life I led, leaving back the gale!
Cause, when I can see the world,
I feel like having the power in my hands,
I've got control of all, in my life!
When I can see the world,
I feel like having the power in my hands,
I've got control of all, all, all…
