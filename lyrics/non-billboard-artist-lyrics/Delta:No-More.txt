No-More:Delta
I gave you more than I could give
And you said nothing, you just disappeared
a fool I was, so naïve
Suddenly it all became so clear
And then you cried, claiming for more
Can't understand, what is what you want?
Don't tell me now it wasn´t like before
I had enough, this was you last taunt
I won't stand your despise and your hate
Had enough working like a slave
Now it's my turn, to settle the score
You won't see me crying anymore
Knocking at your back door
I was so tired of giving all of my love
You have no mercy for my heart at all
You made me suffer like no one before
I will not bother in crying for you no more
Please tell me what I did wrong
I thought I was doing well
Maybe I wasn't that strong?
But you turned my world to hell

I won't stand your despise and your hate
Had enough working like a slave
Now it's my turn, to settle the score
You won't see me crying anymore
Knocking at your back door
I was so tired of giving all of my love
You have no mercy for my heart at all
You made me suffer like no one before
I will not bother in crying for you no…
I just don't get it; you're so hard to understand
You drove me crazy, don't talk to me again
Our love has faded like words written in sand
Oh please don't bother in calling me no more
You made me suffer like no one before
I will not bother in crying for you no…
I just don't get it; you're so hard to understand
You drove me crazy, don't talk to me again
Our love has faded like words written in sand
Oh please don't bother in calling me no more.
