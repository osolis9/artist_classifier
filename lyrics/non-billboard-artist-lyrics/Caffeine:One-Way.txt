One-Way:Caffeine
I wanna live my way,
dont say its the wrong way, 
but its mine.
just to become something,
to become someone this time.

(chorus)
now theres one way to say 
we never wanted anything 
but now there's one way to say 
we never needed anything.

should we expect nine to five?
i dont want that life for me.
cause we deserve so much more 
than be your best for and me.
