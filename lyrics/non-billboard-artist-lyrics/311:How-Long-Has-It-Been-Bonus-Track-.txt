How-Long-Has-It-Been-Bonus-Track-:311
How long has it been
Since you let me in?
I need it yesterday
I've always been that way, oh
I'm excitable to a fault
But that's my fault
Often time grinds to a halt
Seconds assault
Rush the Earth on by
Planet, spin!
Tell me just how long it's been?

How long has it been
Since you let me in?
I need it yesterday
I've always been that way, oh

There are no abstracts
The metaphysics between us
Are showing us patience
Alert and attentive
In the white star silence
We get out of the harness
The farthest
And we make it through the darkness

How long has it been
Since you let me in?
I need it yesterday
I've always been that way

But when I get back to the present
Back in the moment
I'm so grateful that you stayed
The order of the day
Bliss, no delay, play
See that everything is so much more than okay
Feel the rhythm, feel the rhythm play-ay

How long has it been
Since you let me in?
I need it yesterday
I've always been that way

How long has it been?
How long has it been?
