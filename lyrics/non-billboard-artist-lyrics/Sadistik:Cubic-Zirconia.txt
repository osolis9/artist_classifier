Cubic-Zirconia:Sadistik
Cubic Zirconia x2
Cubic Zircon
It's not a diamond if you have to flaunt it
Multi-faceted lacks a polish
Puzzled looks I don't have to solve them
Future's bright my past is on nix
Yeah sad is honest
Ignorance is bliss
So sad is honest
Have no high notes
I lack the octaves
Turn laughs to cries
Those raps dishonest
I'm a cubic zirconia
Such a cubic cubic zirconia
Now i'm catatonic
I had to vanish
But that got tarnished

It's not a diamond if it cracks on impact
It's a present to slide past the gift wrap
If it's a seven when dice lands you get craps
Future's high heaven
Then my past is pitch black
They put my lines and values
Under a microscope to find a value
Kaleidoscope a light astound you
But won't change the price tag I amount to
I'm a cubic Zirconia Cubic Zircon

My father told me
I would grow into a diamond
But since I've lost him
I don't know how to find it
I feel so unpolished
Make me blind then
In the lack luster world
Where nothing's shining
I rearranged these twenty-six
While demons play a lovely bit
To eat away my ugly
Til' I see the day I love at this
It's quite significant, my appraisal
Listen don't drop the gem
And then they'll never praise you
So i'm thankful
There's nobody i'm chained to
Predators don't pray
When there's nobody to pray to
Yeah and now no body can change you
Cubic zirconia
Nobody can save you
