We-Get-Around:Urthboy
We get around we get around

I prowl I growl I scowl
I frown and down my brow
I pout how you like me now
Yeah we scout I pray we out
I kitted out much better than the next man
I'm the damn groom he's the best man
Cut, tailor made ready pressed and
I can help you out make you see like a desk lamp
It's suitable, freeze it pause it
That's beautiful I'm really important
Don't let the public inside of the cordon
Bodyguards do whatever you need to sort em!
Check me on a magazine cover
Ask my opinion on something or other
Umm, I say something or other
After all mutherfuck gotta sing for his supper right?
Trash the room, check out, leave
At least that's the way that they'd have you believe
I'm a give you whatever dream you need
What you walk away with's not what you see

I've seen your photo your photo don't look a thing like you
I've seen your photo for a second I could see right through
I rubbed my eyes swear that they must be telling me lies
But that's you in the photo and the photo don't lie
We get around, we get around
We stare you down from the walls
We get around, we get around
On your call, on your call

Index and middle do the V sign
You don't even need lines or need to read mine
We can be just like Nixon
I am not a crok how could I I'm a Christian
V for Victory, V for Victim
T for Trust me man T's for Tricked em
All down to how you depict em
Can't always pick em, win some lose some listen
We could bang heads bring a new slogan
no more known as Irwin, used to be Hogan
That's what we promote, let the quote do the work
It'll work it'll be worth the dough
Unlikely, "crikey" is just unlike me
It's not like it's in the national psyche
Who could be fake as that?
Like Phillip Ruddoch and his Amnesty badge
That's why I prowl, I growl, I scowl
I frown and down my brow
I pout, oh you like that now?
yeah we scout, but fuck that I'm out

I've seen your photo your photo don't look a thing like you
I've seen your photo for a second I could see right through
I rubbed my eyes swear that they must be telling me lies
But that's you in the photo and the photo don't lie
We get around, we get around
We stare you down from the walls
We get around, we get around
On your call, on your call
We get around, we get around
We stare you down from the walls
We get around, we get around
On your call, on your call
We get around, we get around
You look up at me from the photo
We get around, we get around
I will remember you, I will remember you
