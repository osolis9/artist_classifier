I-m-on-Fire:Shy Glizzy
One time for Benny
Nigga been down since day one
Real nigga in this bitch
Rest in peace, Stew, a.k.a. Twin Blox
There's a lot of young niggas runnin' around here
Calling all of us bosses

I could have been a lawyer or a doctor
I said fuck that, I need more, I'm a robber
You ain't gon' be sure what you grow up, you a liar
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
I could have been a lawyer or a doctor
I said fuck that, I need more, I'm a robber
You ain't gon' be sure what you grow up, you a liar
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

I will make it loud, this the street shit
Fuck my teacher, she a hoe, she ain't teach me shit
She told me, boy, you know you ain't gon' be shit
I linked up with the blurr, he ain't give me bricks
I'm a dawg boy, you a dope boy
We be rapping bout these rap shit, ain't no joke, boy
If your dish think it's your turn, you gon' get smoked, boy
See, it ain't 'bout who you is, it's who you know, boy
In defense, come and get me, what you gon' do?
You gon' let her take you down, or take your whole crew?
Wit you, is you gon' stay too?
Cause that's what real niggas do
Oh!

I could have been a lawyer or a doctor
I said fuck that, I need more, I'm a robber
You ain't gon' be sure what you grow up, you a liar
I'm on fire, I'm on fire
I could have been a lawyer or a doctor
I said fuck that, I need more, I'm a robber
You ain't gon' be sure what you grow up, you a liar
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

I could have worked an hour, but I own a chopper
I didn't have a house and I became a rapper
They tell me that my papa who I take at me
A nigga kill my papa, so I was abandoned
My momma couldn't understand what gotten into me
Thought that it's cool just to sip on Kanye weed
I got my GED in the Penitentiary
I kiss on legs a mil, like a fucking center piece
I rob you for your found or your founds
Aha, smoking on the stone, but my mind on
I'm so tough, sipping down on this stuff
I wanna go sit, see a ghost
