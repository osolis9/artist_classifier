You see i met her on a monday
And her name was chill
From the what-the-hell family's
Relation to free will
Yeah she circled my circumference
Said she had some time to kill
Been combing the beach for a beautiful freak
And i just might fit the bill
She said:

Ooh, i think i'm liking you
Ooh, do you feel the same way too?
I said, ooh, i think i do
I said, ooh, i think you're cute
I said, ooh, merci beaucoup
I said, ooh ooh
And maybe i'm calling you baby
And i might just say you're my love cliche

You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
And i like it that way

You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
And i like it that way

So we fell in love that summer
Underneath the star wars sign
Drinking cases of each other
And guitar and april wine
And we lay down in the alley
As the sunlight hit the pine
And talked of all things great
Like the rose of gertrude stein
And we fell in love that summer
But it lasted eighteen weeks
Used to kiss her on the hummer
Now i kiss her on the cheek
And i vividly remember
In a moment of recline
When she whispered in my ear
"i think i like both kinds"

She said, ooh, i think i do
I said, ooh, i think you're cute
She said, ooh, merci beaucoup
I said, ooh ooh
And maybe i'm chasing amy
And i might just say you're my love cliche

You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
And i like it that way

You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
And i like it that way

I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love

I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love
I'm feeling love

So why don't you tell me what's great?

When the puck hits the net
At the stanley cup game
And miles hits the notes
When he sketches out of spain
And the wedding gets you high
From the perfect catering
And love makes you lie
Even though you bought the ring
And you screw with your spine
And the minor chord change
And the more things change
The more they stay the same
But i'm looking for your kind
Yeah i'll drive through the driving rain
'cause what was so wrong
From the very beginning
That we would have to change

You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
And i like it that way

You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
You're my love cliche
And i like it that way

And maybe i'm calling you baby,
And i might just say you're my love cliche

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
