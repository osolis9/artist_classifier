Paradise-Lost:Swollen Members
(feat. Brady, Tony Da Skitzo)

[Brady]
scared i'm gonna trip my fingers
these fingers stuck in your third eye
as i gotcha paralyzed your heart venture
bad tidings residing in liberal
until nightfall i might crawl outta the shadows in your sleep
cuz my wristbone's connected to the hand bone's connected to the
jizz nasty i can never let it walk on by
why do i feel so high when it strikes mid-knight in shining armor
cybernetic snake charmer
all you can get
your sweat glands and pores in your skin
release spores from within leviathan
can't hang unless you swing by the neck
untempered instrumentals got you smooth
as thinking continental cruise
your core bruise until your spine and
press rewind too many times
and catch several shurikens
to your mind and soul as i swallow it whole
i see you grippin on
cybertron optimist call me crypticon
synchro on quartz tryin to thwart the uppending doom
croonin like coyotes at the moon
when its almost high noon niggaz swoon like ninjas
unite west coast avengers
drift fine swollen member

[Madchild]
sparkling crackling
tackling stacked assailants
medievel magicians practice under heavy surveillance
the ultimate quartet indestructable unpredictable
symbolic sorcerers collaborate with one trick to pull
the trick is to focus
make millions from swollen billions
seek the weak and destroy
soldiers controlling civilians
deploy the daredevil dimension
competition cringes
they couldn't get open if they came equipped with hinges
addicted to dope injected by swollen syringes
this flame thrower singes and burns you to a crisp of ashes
i'm ill suffer from constant hot flashes
bad rock annihlates violator retaliates
vertibreaker will mutilate
ghost causing sirens
hands of hostility strangling evil tyrants
who worship the power plant i've seen many strange things
protect the sacred circle and beware of the changelings

[Tony Da Skitzo]
move the masses changing your acetone mono
we're high tech phonos slash?
labyrinth spreading chaotic activity
wide open door frivolling away like cumulus clouds
your a black rose lost in my black flag
motel strange corridors
with the only sensor receptacles receiving technical difficulties
mics philiac?
no gimmicks
a patch over your left eye
?
while the venomous
serum leaks in your heart print
indent a paragraph and the message is sent
transparent sentiments
that are radioactive
and leave a fritz like apocalypse
leaving the former?
attempt your consciousness like triplets
back to back to back like?
in a foreign country we still excavate doves
isolate you to a torture
merchants in my village
remains of no life just cold breezes and past souls
mistaking fake saviors
blessed in his own castle
now its just relics left back?
and the color is tinted

[Prevail]
enter the uncensored sensor of lord magenta
a member of mensa doctor mind bender
middle earth fabric tearer like?
my crushed velvet cape drags through the quicksand
and long last and scribe masters with poisonous penmanship
summer equinoxes and winter solstices shift liquid land
i lift my crooked hands and orchestrate
the blatent containment of force so florescent
youre surely asking for your melting pot
to be a meeting spot
for contaminate contestants
even nostradamus couldn't predict these Nosferatus
with advanced sharpened lance and pierce you
