(MERT MORTON AKSUNA,OZGUR ERSIN,CEM ERGIN,CAN MISIRLIOGLU)
Excuse me sir
I had a wonderful life
excuse me sir
nothing ever went wrong
excuse me sir
was my life fun to ruin
excuse me sir
think I was today's delight
Struck dumb by your voice
will it ever be the same?
trying was my only mistake
Excuse me sir
now that you are done
excuse me sir
will you see my bloody eyes?
excuse me sir
power made you cold and strong
excuse me sir
yeah! I feel the breeze
