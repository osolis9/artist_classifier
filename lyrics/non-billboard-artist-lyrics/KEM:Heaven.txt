Heaven:KEM
I see the way you look at me
As if to say its right
I pray for you day in and day out

Something's happening to me
The man I used to be is gone
He gave up his life
So I could go on
Girl, on in heaven
Where the love of a lifetime resides
In you
Girl there's heaven in you babe
Oh Girl and it's so meant to be
This place where two souls collide
There's no pain, no fear, only you and I
