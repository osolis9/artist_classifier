Mom was my alarm clock
Every single morning she like buh go get a job
I'm like Momma I been trying
Only Momma know I'm lying

Dirty money
Woke up one day the rent was due
I carried a 22 when you carried a Pikachu
Gigapan 6 or 17 I went to get the tek
Foolish I had the nerve to serve where I was living at
God bless my babies I can't hide this shit I been through
Will I make it where I'm going I don't know to be continued
Only next episode of events just from the trap
We go'n visit where I come from without ever going back
To the dirty money

6 kids in Florida run off and steal a Porsche
Please don't ask me why, I don't know, maybe boredom
They broke in a house found two hundred something thou'
Found a pistol in the car but they tossed the pistol out

They ain't catch no bodies
They just bent some corners
Took the quarter milli went and spent it on they mamas now
Two teens in Tennessee burnt down the whole community
14 deaths and two hundred something injuries
And sixteen hundred structures to the ground can you imagine
People houses rented cabins left to nothing mortar ashes
Two teens in Tennessee are white as Andy Griffin
And the other six are not, guess who got they charges dropped
