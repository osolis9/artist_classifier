Imperialism:AWKWORD
This Awkword
That's what it is!

So what about Africa? Oh, they're just black.
Half a year spend on the... and glast over the facts
About the rape and murdering, civilized aristocrats
Scrambling for Africa like rats tremble through trash
A... for cash, birth control and domination
Political goal plans just struggle, hold the population
Forced inhabitation, game to capture the flag
Turned my body and soul into.. rags.
See .. of the planets
Now technology occupied my mind, God damn it!
For the love of MJ, I know God couldn't plan it
Global warmth is got us all locked, how are we standing?
Make a mountain out a mold hill, drop bombs without Congress
Wherever my colleagues where my people acting obnoxious.
What you got, I want it! Your block, I'm on it!
The ratchet of the Earth, imperialism is upon us!

Hook:
Watch the snakes that coil and strike
That bite whoever fights for their rights, the spoils of life
Show the cave men fire, burn them alive!
Change of vocation, game and gold genocide
Irrelative lines of the elephant tribe
Democracy, the free test while the priest is worldwide
On a theme ... promotion of lies
About a region of heathens that should be civilized!

The rule in the league: brutally beat innocent lives
Genocide for a third man uncivilized
If the battle we fought, how the young rise?
Divine, conquer, strategize, imperialism aside,
Getting raised, gender or class
Placing the cap,... with the enslavary...
If not physical, the mental will
..any quality not up to the task.
Revolution will show you the path just like a...
1914 began worst path.
The end of days in the rage of the two wars
Half the world suffered in depression while the rest of them left
But the rest of me,
Sons of the ones too chained, is still a slave ..
By any means, manifest destiny
Not get expense of the West
You see it bigger than the US,
Bigger than the UN, new M
Imperialism, a clear vision,
sees the EU movements!
Snakes .. and missed the hell
Document in cell, they sell their bullshit!

Like the death... vortex, they're killing us with raw sex
They... with death, murder us with more press.
The epitome of cynicism, a sense of living
Where you can't see the light, and you're sense is dimming
The bi-product of lies in the eye conduct
The rise of the machines, grab roots, ties and...
Those rhyming on love, blood, diamonds and slug
Pay you no mind, my people just mind to get caught
The mineral is high in the pulse of the earth,
The poor die, the riches worth ... and take turn.
Rudy Kipling tried casting a spell
White man's burden, the black man's hell in the shell
Corruption, violence, ethnic conflicts
And they still wondering where the bomb is
We're lacking education and healthcare
The sense of self disappear, the community's scared!
