Ortiz-Anthem:Fieldy
Bow down to me you sissy la la, I'm gunna bounce on your face,
Like 64 impala, when you see me in the ring,
And I pop my collar, remember whose a king,
Ortiz, a pimp balla, adrenalin rush, enough to throw a truck,
Before I put you in this pain, I wish you a lot of luck,
If you didn't know the scene, and I don't give a but fuck whuck,

I'm like a bull of Spain, tied for a month,
For you my friend, you like a sitting little duck,
You'll never see right hand, but you'll feel my uppercut,
Ain't know way your gonna win, if you do it's out of luck,
I'm gonna pound on your face, like I'm tenderizing a steak,
Have the paramedics wait, while I split your fucking face,
I'm a piranha in that lake, your a piece of fish bait,
Ain't no discussion or debate, Tito was born with this fate

Tito's in the ring, scream,
Ortiz please the crowd, bow to your knees,
Tito's in the ring, scream,
Knock you out without a doubt, it's good to be the king,
Tito's in the ring, scream,
Scream and shout, gonna knock this fool out,
Tito's in the ring, scream,
Ortiz please the crowd, bow to your knees

Gonna knock this fool out, so I can buy a new house,
Ortiz, you should never doubt, thanks for the home,
And all I had to do, was split you fucking dome
Shut you up like a monk, with the power of this punch,
There goes your lunch, better run for his gump,
You can't fuck with Ortiz, unstoppable disease,
Bitch please, bow to your knees,
Better pray for you life, when you step in the ring,
Want the ultimate fight, wanna fuck with the king,
You might see the light, you know exactly what I mean,
Cut up and ribbed, you can't fuck with this shit,
My fist in your face, knock you out quick,
When I sock you in your face, blood from your lip,
That's all you gunna taste, (the kid is the king)
You got something to say, say Tito the great

Tito's in the ring, scream,
Ortiz please the crowd, bow to your knees,

Tito's in the ring, scream,
Ortiz please the crowd, bow to your knees

Shivering at your knees when you look at Ortiz,
No mercy, no remorse, you about to be a corpse,
Wipe the smile off your face, before I knock out your teeth,
This ain't the time, this ain't the place,
You take the ground, I'll take the crown,
O to the G to the you to the F to the see,
Original gangsta of the UFC
