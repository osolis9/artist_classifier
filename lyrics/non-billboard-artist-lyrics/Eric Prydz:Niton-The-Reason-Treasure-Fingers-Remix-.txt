Niton-The-Reason-Treasure-Fingers-Remix-:Eric Prydz
You are the reason why
Years fly by, and I don't find
The strength I need to grow
I know, I know

Enemies, they stand in line
I'm on my knees, and I can't find
The words I to let you know
I know, I know, I know

You are the reason why
Years fly by, and I don't find

The strength I need to grow
I know, I know

Enemies, they stand in line
I'm on my knees, and I can't find
The words I to let you know
I know, I know, I know

You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
You are the reason why
