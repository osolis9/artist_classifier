Take-Me-Home-Jordy-Dazz-remix-radio-edit-:Cash Cash
I'm fallin' to pieces
But I need this, yeah I need this
You're my fault, my weakness
When did you turn so cold?
You cut me down to the bone
Now you're dancin' all over my soul
I'm fallin' to pieces
To pieces, to pieces

But I still stay
Cause you're the only thing I know
So won't you take
Oh, won't you take me home

Take me home, home, home 2x
Take me

Round in circles here we go
With the highest highs
And the lowest lows
But no one shakes me like you do
My best mistake was you
You're my sweet affliction
Cause you hurt me right
But you do it nice
Round in circles here we go
Oh yeah

But I still stay
Cause you're the only thing I know
So won't you take
Oh, won't you take me home

Take me, I still stay
Oh, won't you take me home
Take me home
