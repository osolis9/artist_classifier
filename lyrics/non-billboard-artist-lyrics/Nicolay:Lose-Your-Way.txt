Lose-Your-Way:Nicolay
There is a spirit in the city tonight
Feel it in the air we breathe
So let's go outside

See the people in the city tonight
Searching for a place to be
Struggling shuffling trying to find their own way

So take my hand and don't let go, babe

We'll take a walk through the city tonight
So many sights we've never seen
Our eyes open wide

So as we breathe in the city tonight
A maiden journey so wild and free
Stay by my side for the night until the day breaks

So take my hand and don't let go, babe

Even when the streets are dirty and the sun is shining
Everybody's got a story to tell
Welcome to my city life

Even when the nights are quiet and the moon is rising
Every face has some glory to sell
See me smiling in the city lights

Lose your way
Baby, I won't let you lose your way

And the lights in the city start to fade away
