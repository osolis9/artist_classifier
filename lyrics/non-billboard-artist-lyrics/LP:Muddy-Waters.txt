Muddy-Waters:LP
[Verse 1]
We are kneeling at the rivers edge and tempting
All the steps to follow closer right behind
Is it only when you feel a part is empty
That it’s gnawing at the corners of your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I will ask you for mercy
I will come to you blind
What you’ll see is the worst me
Not the last of my kind
[Chorus]
In the muddy water we’re falling
In the muddy water we’re crawling
Holds me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy waters we’re falling

[Verse 2]
It is not clear why we choose the fire pathway
Where we end is not the way that we had planned
All the spirits gather 'round like its our last day
To get across you know we’ll have to raise the sand

[Pre-Chorus]
I will ask you for mercy
I will come to you blind
What you’ll see is the worst me
I'm not the last of my kind

[Chorus]
In the muddy water we’re falling
In the muddy water we’re crawling
Holds me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy water we’re falling (falling, falling, falling...)

[Bridge]
Don’t fail me now
Put your arms around me and pull me out
I know I’m found
With your arms around me, oh save me now

[Chorus]
In the muddy water we’re falling
In the muddy water we’re crawling
Holds me down
Hold me now
Sold me out
In the muddy water we’re falling
