Trap-Door:Jake One
He moves the crowd like a cursor on Doom
No curse words, Doom the worst church nerd verse heard
Appeared blurred to a million true believers
Here's the super villain, armed dealer to the divas

Catch, amongst other world scandals
Butter pearl handles to match your girl's sandals
Plan was hatched by a pack of old vandals
Who flag was a black and gold patch with bloody anvils

Hit 'em to the head was the motto
And one more time to make sure them dead, Blakko
When you throw blows in a knife fight, Paco
That's how it goes in this modern life like Rocko

Clock dough, 24-7 cycle
When it comes to flows he got more than a mic full
Pull a broad like a dyke bull on a long bid
You're messing with the wrong kids, Michael

It ain't Jackson
For him to flip scripts like camera, action
Villain, grew up by the laws of attraction
For future generation's information, the black one

Move the crowd like a Buddha cloud
The purple, puff, puff, pass 'round the circle
A jerk well renowned for his work skill
He's out, the proof is the computer's down, Urkel

MC a show via Wi-Fi
And tag rate before we wrap it up like tie dye
Hip hop, sci-fi you can see had the Eye of the Tiger
Do the Mask like the Fry Guy

Just met a baby home make dome
Check lefts some folks ancestor home wreck
With blown backs these lesser known facts thwart evil
You got no reason like short people

No offense, the street was burnt brass
Whenever he walked on the street it turned glass
On his lucky rat's paw in the crap drawer
All the world's a stage, where's the trap door, slack jaw?

Logic to keep your mind in the project
Drop the check, his job is to chop neck
That's just payback for nose, there's no psych though
What they don't know like Bo

Won't hurt diddly squat
Got to be kidding me, not
Seriously plot, to put a hit out on the G-spot
Gypped like oozing out the kettles in they teapot, that's right
