Who-I-Am:Brandy
Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best, I feel blessed, I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile? All you did was help the next man
This experience made me who I am

Tried to make me love ya, I tried to make me stay
But every time I tried myself and I got in the way
Just for the sake of my daughter, I tried to stick to the plan
But I had to get rid of the weight on my fourth finger, left hand
To everybody listening, sorry if your disappointed
See the life I chose was only what I thought I wanted
Nothings picture perfect, looks can be deceiving
What I thought was love was something I could not believe in

Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best, I feel blessed, I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile? All you did was help the next man
This experience made me who I am

I always had the feeling that baby boy was cheating
I kept telling myself if you ain't happy Bran just leave him
I wasn't raised to quit 'cause quitters never win
But what do you gain if you feel incomplete within?
Sick of all the questions, all the whats and whys?
What happened? Why'd y'all break up? Why we never see you cry?
But do you know how it feels, to hurt behind close doors?
When you go outside, you're wondering what you're smiling for?

Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best, I feel blessed, I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile? All you did was help the next man
This experience made me who I am

Now that it's over I can live, now all you had belongs to him
My heart is open like a book and everything he eats, I cook
What I am to him, he is to me we are each others everything
But if I would have stayed with you, I wouldn't have it like I do

Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
You're the best, I feel blessed, I'm a better woman now
Look how I smile? All you did was help the next man
This experience made me who I am

Thank you for all the tears, all the stress
