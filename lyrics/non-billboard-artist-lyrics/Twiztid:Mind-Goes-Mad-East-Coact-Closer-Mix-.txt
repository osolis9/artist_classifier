For The Fam Volume 2

[Verse 1: Monoxide]

Patience, frustrations, keep chasing sensations
Keep filling with hatred, I don't think I'll make it
Can anybody take another life? All while I'm tellin'
Maybe they can find a book or somethin', give another answer
Tellin' 'em I'm just a crazy bastard, psycho with his head on backwards
Sure I'm killin' the beat but I'd rather go kill in the street
My sanity is obsolete, I got blood stains all on my teeth
From eatin' the weak, you can see it drip every time I speak
Somebody better get 'em up out of my reach
'Fore my brain tells me that it's time to eat
And my mind goes mad like I'm out for heat

[Hook]

My mind goes mad
Goes mad
My mind goes mad

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]

Anxiety, my mind screamin' "Die for me!"
All the while I know there's lines
So inside of me it has tried to be
Better then I ever thought I would try to be
And I try to speak but my words are always followed by apologies
And that's probably the real reason my tendencies, they devour me
Like addiction, it callows me like a dog on a short chain
Real big, black heart but a small brain
Feelin' like a million bucks but I'm small change
Gotta few shorts in my mainframes while I maintain (insane!)
Look inside the window, your in my eyes, on my mind
Never try, then the vessel of the body would of died
And if it wasn't for my pride I wouldn't have to divide
A need to split sides and how I fantasize behind the face I hide
And mix it with suicide and resurrect, revive
And still keep it alive like breathe in, breathe out
Try to calm down, take the gun out of my mouth!
