[Verse 1] 
Somebody's dying today and new babys are born 
some celebrate they life and other’s heart's are torn 
some tear at the funeral others party the birthdays 
some say that it's a zen ying yeng the erthway 
god gave it a life so he could take it awayat anytime he wants 
no matter how much I pray when the time is done 
lordy lodrd don't have no mercy whe it's time to go 
well it's time to go ＂Life’s a bitch then you die＂ 
I know but god how do you choose who staying and who's not? 
And I was praying with all my heart that 
you choose not him not her andwhy not them?! 
Crooked cops and theives who took my watch 
and teath drug dealers and killers who just pop and then leave 
criminals and pedifiles raping 
women and children dumb presidents and villins 
on a killing spree to fill up they greeed to get what they need at all cost

[Verse 2] 
I'm loosing faith like my name was BIG 
the life after death I don't know 
if I be up in heaven for quesitoning you and having a doubt would you condemd me 
to hell if I scream and shout the lords name in vein for that I'm going insane 
feeling pain for my main man 
that left me early no mercy like that thug 
that I met up in jersey 
was trippin for my chain
he really wanted to hurt me got me nervous on purpose acted like he gonna mirk me 
shifty undercover cop lowdown and dirty playing God 's game just to let me know he can 
I'm a brave heart but he had a gat in his hand he was a one of many devils 
with them heavy metals 
who likes to meddlle wit them people with haerts of anglesbbut my man wasn't 
he was a good father a son a loving husband 
beloved by the dozen 9 to 5 just to get by a regular dude but he was gifted 
his mind was a miraculous tool watchin' his mooves like spectacular cool 
he had a passions of christ and copassion of buddha 
when my mind wonder off 3 :10 to Yuma he dealt wit my pain and many others 
for real he felt my pain better than 
any doctors he was a reason that im breathing and he's not no more what for 
lord I know the world is yours what for? 
He not breathing no more you didn't have to take him we got devils glore
