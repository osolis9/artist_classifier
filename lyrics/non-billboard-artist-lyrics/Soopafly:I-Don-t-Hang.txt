I-Don-t-Hang:Soopafly
Yes, yes y'all, yes, yes y'all
Yes, yes y'all, yes, yes y'all
Yes, yes y'all, yes, yes y'all
Yes, yes y'all, yes, yes y'all

Ruff rugged tha incredible one, Soopafly come wit' tha bomb
A pound to brake a muthafucka down
Surrounded,by subliminal thoughts to keep me criminal minded
You'll find its hard fuckin' wit' a dog that'll scar

Your whole mind body soul approach
Devastated, elevated your shit never made it
However can one dare to compare a style rare from ground to air above
Showin' no love, now it's tha pimpin' flow

Interests show, that you ain't hittin' no mo
Your shit's gettin' old, forget tha past
Don't let tha past pave a way to tha world occupied by MC's that I slay
Affect tha first when I select a verse to hit you with tha worse intention

Blast in three dimension,sharp like a ginzu
Then you will understand that I split niggas to fragments of a man
Differential from pots to pans, opposition at a glance
I rate,and takin' chances quick to brake like branches

I'm like a bunchy on a midnight get right or get even
You're wondering like Steven running from day light to evening
Time, 'cos I bust shots to injure, I stay black and smooth like a ninja
It's Soopafly quick to throw them thangs
I get tha money and rings, muthafuckaz can't hang cos

I don't hang with no bustas, I don't hang with no fags
I don't hang with no connivin' ass niggas who ain't out there makin' cash
Sho nuff don't hang with no snitches, sho nuff don't fuck with no bitches
I'm only out for my riches
So muthafuckaz stay tha fuck out my business

Feel tha beat
I gots to have it
I gots to have it
I gots to have it

I'm explanatory like Rogaine what's your name was mine?
Soopafly game do or die
Death becomes those who oppose and run up
Muthafuckaz get done up, on a one two come up
(Come up)

Evidently you've been bitin' for years all skills to adapt to
(Nigga I'll pimp slap you)
My rhyme trap you, attractin' bitches and hoes
Then developin' tha 51 flows

I suppose, I got you runnin' like your nose
Like threat, shot to my niggas that can't get wet
Betcha, I spoke a lecture I let cha think everythin' is fine
Then react inna blinks time over done

I'm rated number one contender
Tha war zone engage or surrender
Now if tha kicks fit nigga wear that shit
Give me a stage and microphone I'm bound to tear that shit

Tha fuck up,now what cha gon do?
Take a seat, or step to my mystic well then pack tha concrete
Now how you gonna act? I'll lay your ass flat
It's Soopafly comin' with tha shit like that
(Like that, like that)

I gots to have it, 'cos I want it and I need it
I gots to have it, 'cos I want it and I need it

Now only I control thee unfold thee
Uncut and uncensored floatin' vista, it's ah
Sort of like a mixture, can you picture
One calm and cool one that burn like the sun

The one two, two to three Soopafly rolls freely
(Freely)
High to the sky, muthafuckas can't see me
(See me)
I'm skulls like a beanie, I'm disappearin' like a genie
(Beanie, genie)

Intoxicated off tha Remy
(Remy)
Martin I'm startin' to box up fools by tha carton
It's tha one, incredible fly
I fly by day, droppin' bombs on thee E.P.
With Dat Nigga Daz still representin' D.P.

Now I don't hang with no bustas and I don't hang with no fags
And I don't hang with no connivin' ass niggas
Who ain't out there makin' cash
Sho nuff don't hang with no snitches, sho nuff don't fuck with no bitches
I'm only out for my riches
So muthafuckaz stay tha fuck out my business

Waitin' baitin' for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop
(Flop, flop)
Waitin' baitin' for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop
(Flop, flop)

Waitin' baitin' for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop
(Flop, flop)
Waitin' baitin' for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop
(Flop, flop)

No I don't
