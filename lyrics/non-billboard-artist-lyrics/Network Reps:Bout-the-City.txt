Oh, I can see them about the town
I can hear them all say
(Bollap ba bollap)
Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do
Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do
Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do
Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do

(Musical Interlude)

Yes!

Not bad, I don't think they're bad
Even if sometimes they look so mad
Guys in sound, the guys are sound
And everybody's talking about 'em
Won't you play me that song
To make me strong
You will sing, I will make it if I do
Take me to the power
Get out of the corner
Take me to the border
I will make it as they do
I can see them all about the town
Oh, I can hear them all say
(Bollap ba bollap)
Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do

Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do

(Musical Interlude)
YES!!

They have changed the same old scene
It's not a story in a magazine
Guys in town, they're hanging around
Don't you know they'll never let you down
I believe in what I feel
To make it real
Won't you sing I will make it if I do
Take me to the power
Get out of the corner
Take me to the border
I will make it as they do
I can see them all about the town
Oh, I can hear them all say
(Bollap ba bollap)

Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do
Doo wop, bollap, listen to the music
Doo wop bollap do

Course I do!
You do?
Course I do!
Say what?

(Musical Interlude)

Won't you play that song
To make me strong
Won't you sing, I will make it if I do
Take me to the power
Get out of the corner
Take me to the border
I will make it as they do
I can see them all about the town
Oh, I can hear them all say
