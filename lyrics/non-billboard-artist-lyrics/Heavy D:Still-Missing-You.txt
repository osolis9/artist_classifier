Still-Missing-You:Heavy D
feat. Carl Thomas

The mansion is just an extension of the pain
The hallways echo when I holler her name
I swallow the pride holler the fame
Narrow the lane, so she could play the game alone
Nowadays don’t even answer the phone
Her late late, she don’teven come home
My babe babe don’t act the same no more
It’s like the game we arranged and things done changed

It was over before it was over
But now I’m right back where I started, alone again
Feeling empty and broken hearted
No matter what I do, still missing you

Lately you do things you never used to
Instead of listening you turn around and walk away
Your side of the bed is getting cold
Coming home late it’s getting old
I guess there’s nothing left to do, missing you girl

How do you give up a love like that
How do you give up a love so fast
I’m missing you, I’m still missing you girl
How do you give up a love like that
How do you give up a love so fast
I’m missing you, I’m still missing you girl

You used to text me out be over
But nowadays the sex is like the same old thing, mundane thing
To say I love you feels like I’m choking
But I’d rather walk away, and love you just the same

How do you give up a love like that
How do you give up a love so fast
I’m missing you, I’m still missing you girl
How do you give up a love like that
How do you give up a love so fast
I’m missing you, I’m still missing you girl

Yo, what happened to the good old days, the hood old days
Used to draw the shades lay in bed play all day
Gone to work 6 stay home all day
Now I’m alone all day
While you’re gone all day,
Roaming the streets, till we don’t speak all day
And I’m bugging like what happened to her loving rays
It’s like I’m in the drugged out days, over bugged up maze
Momy ain’t the same, it’s a shame

How do you give up a love like that
How do you give up a love so fast
I’m missing you, I’m still missing you girl
How do you give up a love like that
How do you give up a love so fast
I’m missing you, I’m still missing you girl.
