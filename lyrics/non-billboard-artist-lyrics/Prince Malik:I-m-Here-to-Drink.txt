Walk up in the scene like I don't give a fuck
Like I just turned 21 and tonight I'm getting drunk
Started drinking at the crib so my buzz is on its way
So make sure to leave more drivers here to stay, hey
I got no money in my pocket, all I got is credit card
And I'm blowing up my limit like a star, hah

I'm feeling good (I'm feeling good)
The room is spinning (room is spinning)
And I feel like Charlie Sheen, winning!

(Pre-)
‘Cause we came here tonight to do one thing right
We ain't leaving til he club turn off the lights

I'm here to drink drink drink drink drink
Fuck what you think think think think think
So put yo glasses in the sky,
Smoke that shit til you get high tonight, high tonight

In the club all crazy models and bottles up in this party
Shawty keep doin what you doin, drop it low, we get you to start it
And you say you got a man but homie not here so baby let's go
With a body so mean, face so bad, niggas want to roll

Jump in the area, she doing my thing
Girl like she got me open
And say whatever, she fly as bird
Yea, her body is broken

(Pre-)
‘Cause we came here tonight to do one thing right
We ain't leaving til he club turn off the lights

I'm here to drink drink drink drink drink
Fuck what you think think think think think
So put yo glasses in the sky,
Smoke that shit til you get high tonight, high tonight

I've worked like 50 hours, 50 now I'm letting loose
Where's the sexy chocolate? I need another shot of goose
And the bathroom smell like weed
There's been something on my sleeve
But I feel like I don't ever wanna leave, nah
And tonight I'm putting everyone a picture of his glove
On the count of 3 put your middle fingers up
Everybody now, 1
Let me hear you say 2
Act like you don't care, 3
Put your fingers in the air, yea

(Pre-)
‘Cause we came here tonight to do one thing right
We ain't leaving til he club turn off the lights

I'm here to drink drink drink drink drink
Fuck what you think think think think think
So put yo glasses in the sky,
Smoke that shit til you get high tonight, high tonight

Put your glasses in the sky
