Black boy all white class
Call me the white boy with a black mask
White vocab on the south side
Boy, you better have a nice jab
You don't know, you don't know
My whole life I've been a type cast
And they never let me went free
So Ima teach in that life class
I should be, I should be tired by now
I don't wanna try no more
I should be cold from the marches they throw, but
I will not, I will not ever go back and forth with ya
Call me every name under the sun, but
You won't get a rise
I am not the one

Oh I oh I oh I
I am not the one
Oh I oh I oh I
I am not the
Oh I oh I oh I
Oh I oh I oh I

What they gonna say?
Too far
Always gonna say you took it too far
That's cool but know nothing gonna move dawg
Cause we live for the opinion of the true God
Exactly who you not
It ain't thick skin it's a new heart
He's been burning coals on a wound so
Who gon' tying enemies to a futon
Too squad looking like a military
You can't regenerate a soul on Luke Cage
I will kick in the pain homie Liu Kang
You might need a president but homie who reigns?
Satan got a pen on me
So what you gonna pen on me?
A pen on me
Free free you can put the pen on me
They depend on me win only when y'all ready pen notice
Who is K to the second?
I am cool when they messy
They can't take my peace
Cause they did not give it to me
The spirit of God is inside of me
You are not fighting me

I am not the one
I am not the one
No no
I am not the one
You already know what I thought
You don't know what I've done
I am not the one

Cross em', they blackmail you dawg
Well I am a black male and Christian that's three strikes against me
And plus you ain't blackmailing God
Counted out since I learned how to count
Count of cowards no account when I'm quiet there
I am getting louder now
For the great I am
The show ain't sold out but I am
And if it sells out homie I can't
You calling me and just know you gonna get you some Jesus
Cause tone it down I am not
Politicking for no status
Kingdom got me feeling massive
All we know is please the Master
I am not going backwards
Calling me the Christian rapper
All I know I just wanna be more Christian than rapper
I am not the one you should know
I am not the one you should know
I am invincible when I am invisible
He is the one you're looking for

I am not the one
I am not the one
No no
I am not the one
You already know what I thought
You don't know what I've done
I am not the one

He is, He is, He is
He is, He is, He is
