Steal-My-Sunshine:Len
I was lying on the grass
On Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self defeats
My mind was thugged
All laced and bugged
All twisted round and beat
Uncomfortable three feet deep

Now the fuzzy stare from not being there
On a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar-speak
And of course you can't become
If you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I was frying on the bench slide
In the park across the street
L A T E R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws
Out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight foot heap

Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear
In a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among
But I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not something hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)

My sunshine
(If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine
(If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine
(If you steal my sunshine)
