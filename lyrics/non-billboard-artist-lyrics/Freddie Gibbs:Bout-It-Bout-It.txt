[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Yea woop woop, yep yep
Snap back stay bang to the left
East side nigga bang to the death
My niggas we the lane to the rest
So poke bottle a little liquor
That keeps songs out and they vicious
Nigga tryin to bust them down but then I looked around
And gotta overlap but no swishas, what's up
Roll some, smoke some, let me poke some
Man I gotta better use it like foe some
When the clock struck five I was in the ride
Five dirty she was already on my line
Sayin what about breakfast, but a nigga like me too restless
Got a lot of money on my checklist
All in my whole OP niggas in Texas

He said this game so dirty gotta roll around with my thirty
Can I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried
He said this game so dirty gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
No doubt about it, no doubt about it
Keep hoes around me don't fuck with them hoes that doubt me
My nigga's bout it, and my bitch's bout it
And my dick too crowded got too many people on it
Now if people talking bout you then know you're doing things
They ask about my song, they like the way I screw it man
Hey, these bitches poppin, man these nigga coppin
Man I feel like every label in the world just signed me
Yeah I'm from the bottom, when we sip drink and we poppin pills
We pop the seal, got diamond grills
And I'll fuck your girl while I'm bending curves
One think about it, say one think about it
I'm always about it only touch it for a profit yeah

This how my niggas in the projects do
Grind till you got a coupe no boop
Grind till you put your moms in a new spot
On the block with the bomb it was too hot
On the block with the bomb it was so cold
Tell the dope on my snow to my toes froze
Deliver 36 hoes in the owes bows
One stop nigga been through the whole dough
One stop nigga been through the whole brick
Eyes water with now that's cold shit
When it's hot keep it cold bitch
Straight biz to work from the bro bitch
