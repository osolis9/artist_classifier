First-Time:Bad Ronald
Now this is what I am talking about
Stuck in side but I am letting it out
I am struggling just to keep my poise
And I don't stop screaming till I lose my voice

Keep on doing what I feel the most
One last hit and then I am ghost
If it's not my fault that's how it has to be
That's how I am keeping my chastity

If I had it all I would give it away
No idea how I am living today
Line by line, show by show
I got these ladies toe to toe

Couple of drinks and I am ready to go
Ask me again and I'll still say, no

Don't be hating on me, baby
Give me that sweet stuff all night long
I feel like it's my first time
I feel like it's my first time

I remember the first time I met you
Couldn't for get you, everything was right
Knew I had to let you into my life

But the question was how
It all seems so clear looking back now
Back in '92 didn't have a clue
School bell ring sky clear blue

Get my ass home, call you on the phone
You promise later on that night, we be alone
Next five hours, don't think I sat
Took a trip to the store for a lubricated hat

Check my self in the mirror 91 times
Rehearsed in my head 99 lines
Came to your door, you grabbed me by the hand
Heart beatin' quick I am about to be a man

Girl, you satisfy my soul
Went to put the Trojan on, and I lost control

Don't be hating on me, baby
Give me that sweet stuff all night long
I feel like it's my first time
I feel like it's my first time

I am always waking up real early
Some time around two o'clock
Girls can't wait for me to call
So they can get this started

It's a daily operation
F train to my subway station
But I am still a virgin, babe
So let's stick to masturbation

Remember shit, I am ready to go
Saw a girl I met at a show
Forgot her name and she got mad
How could she miss what she never really had?

Got love from here to infinity
Lose control when she's in my vicinity
I want to take her home
And show her I am a surgeon
Tell I love her then tell her I am a virgin

Don't be hating on me, baby
Give me that sweet stuff all night long
I feel like it's my first time
I feel like it's my first time
