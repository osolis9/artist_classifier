Ridin-:Paul Wall & Chamillionaire
Chorus: 
Oh, oh, oh
Just riding old school Cadillac 
Gucci on my feet, pack full of cash
… my neck, just shine ‘em right
Haters looking back, cause I’m living the life
Just ride, come on, yeah
Just ride, come on, yeah
Just ride, come on, yeah
Just ride, come on, yeah

Yeah, I woke up feeling so cold
I think I saw a nigger shining at the old school
Yeah, took a shower and threw on my …
…it’s time to take a photo
Yeah, watch the candy…
Same color as your..
The sun hit the whip and give a new…
Ride with my block just cause…
Stay up on the glam, that’s how the… 
Call my nigger Pall Mall, cause I’m sipping on…
Grouse! I need my grill done too
In beat kicking like a new Kung Fu
Man, a nigger, nigger so fly against it 
And I see the look in your eye, you’re hating nature!
..got the white … so clean
We own, new division, that’s the whole team!

Haters looking back, cause I’m living the life
Just ride, come on, yeah
Just ride, come on, yeah
Just ride, come on, yeah

Say for real!
I’m one hundred to my hot style
Cradling down one…
Chasing paper all day and …
My MJ ain’t… 
..on my chest, I’m making my tea
My slack has the same color as… 
And the screens falling down like an…
See … gold diggers and we hardly sleep 
And we hang around killers that are hardly sweet
All the way from Denver…
Got my mind on my money and my hand on my pistol grip
My .. when I’m.. least.
… I got my pockets full of paper cause I’m in the mix.
The fast life got me rich and I love it from the bottom of the bucket
Now I’m on top, baby
Just ride!
