Rollin-and-Tumblin-mono-:Cream
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

We were rollin' and tumblin'
Right the whole night long

We were rollin' and tumblin'
Right the whole night long

When I woke up this mornin', baby
All I had was gone

Well, I rolled my baby
She's goin' to jump and shout

Well, I rolled my baby
She's goin' to jump and shout

When that train rolls up, boys
I'm gonna come walkin' on home

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Engine driver blows that whistle
Fireman rings that bell

Engine driver blows that whistle
Fireman rings that bell

Well, I didn't have time, boys
To bid my baby farewell
