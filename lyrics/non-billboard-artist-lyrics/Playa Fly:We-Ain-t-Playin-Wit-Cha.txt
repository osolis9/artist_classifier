We-Ain-t-Playin-Wit-Cha:Playa Fly
Aiyyo we mob
Aiyyo we mob

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Aiyyo we mob together
For we mafia members
We make you lemons remember
That we ain't playin witcha

Aiyyo we mob forever
For we mafia members
We make you lemons remember
That we ain't playin witcha

[VERSE 1]
Say mane
How many gon mob wit me
How many gon roll wit me
Now many get money wit me
The real blow dro wit me
I mob over broken hearts
Glock cause I flip and dodge
These haters I disregard
As Minnie Mae forward march
The family stand strong
Thumpin to get it on
And stack up some meal tickets
By drilling this microphone
I crazily chase my paper
Ride with motivators
My members are infiltrators
Who dismount on imitators
Fly do this forever
Who will win this war ever
M to 3 want the cheddar
I-B-N wants the mozzarella
The average fella
Can't compare to my campaign
Or sip on my champagne
My mafia brothers
With them I only will hiz-ang
We ride together
Get so high together
If your static's erratic
We open fire together
If Fly got it I'll get cha
Oh so quick Fly will hit cha
To make you lemons remember
We ain't playin witcha

[Chorus]

[VERSE 2]
When I rock and roll
Fly rock the soul
Over your mind and body
I have complete control
Outside I slide
Jump in my ride
My ride Fly 2 K and
FLY2K Fly glide
All across the border
And to the Fly world order
And for my mafia living
Got IBN feelin immortal
The realest in my veins
Is simple and plain
See I was made a man
So I can take the pain
So I wake and shi-zake
Rise and shiz-ine
Down some dri-zo
And mob for mine
I want all the monies
And Fly will be coming
And every day will be sunny
When Fly done flooded the country
We will continue to rock shows
Rapidly pop moes
Rack up some cheese stacks
And mountainly stack dough
And say that it's over wit
If I'm nonchalant in this
And let you lemons know
That I-B-N ain't been playin with this

[Chorus altered]
And see we mob together
For we mafia members
We make you lemons remember
That we ain't playin witcha

And see we mob forever
For we mafia members
We make you lemons remember
That we ain't playin witcha

[VERSE 3]
You see my mafia members ride out for better or worse
And where it hurts is where we hit ya
Knock you clean in reverse
I stand with first family Minnie Mae forever my man
So understand when we come to get cha we are not playin
We mo serious than heart attacks
Bout lyrically breakin backs
For the rest of your diz-ays (days)
You'll suffer from flash backs
A Mafia madness
And musical fatness
And how did they cap that
Mane how did they cap this
This all I can say Joe
See I'm bout my paper though
And backed up by brothers like these that have no where else to go
We in for the dirty top
Sit down and open shot
Bring M's and Ones to fertilize my morning crops
The love ain't stopping
As long as y'all keep poppin
And to the ones who jockin
This one for y'all I'm rockin
I-B-N I'm knocking
But your door ain't unlocking
I'm bustin in my friend
And all you suckas are droppin
So mane you best to remember

[Chorus altered]
Boy we mob together
For we mafia members
We make you lemons remember
That we ain't playin witcha

And boy we mob forever
For we mafia members
We make you lemons remember
That we ain't playin witcha
