Bullets:Assassin
Bullets do represent the war
Bullets are not game
Bullets are made just to kill
To overcoming enemies

Shooting, killing and smashing
That is the bullets idea
You won't have another chance
To love your life secondly

Bullets are killing for no meaning
Bullets will bring the death
Bullets are killing for no meaning
Bullets will bring the death

Bullets are made by human hand
Bullets are not alive
Bullets are thrashing through the place
Destructing the rest of our world

Bullets are to kill, bullets do destruct
Bullets you will see, bullets, bullets
Bullets are will, bullets the countdown
Bullets you will see, bullets
