Must-Be-Crazy:Big Brovaz
La La La La La La La La (x4)

You said you love me in a million ways
All the broken promises and still i stay
This Illusion believing everything was okay (okay)

I never thought you would play with my emotions
I never thought you could be so controlling
Now you throwing it all away i bet you're all alone now (alone)

Boy you must be crazy (crazy)
Thinking you can take me from my baby
Can't you see that he's the only one that i adore
Don't need you anymore (no)
Don't need you anymore (no, no more)

(Hey!)

?
?
You left me crying so many times over and over (over and over, yeah)

I never thought you would play with my emotions
I never thought you could be so controlling
Now you throwing it all away i bet you're all alone now (all alone, alone)

Boy you must be crazy (crazy)
Thinking you can take me from my baby (take me from my baby)
Can't you see that he's the only one that i adore (he's the only one)
Don't need you anymore (no no no)
Don't need you anymore
(i don't need you, i don't need you, no more)
(i don't need you, i don't need you, no more)

I'm so happy without you
thought i never leave you
Wonder why it took me so long to realize, that i could do it on my own

Boy you must be crazy
Thinking you can take me from my baby
Can't you see that he's the only one that i adore
Don't need you anymore (anymore, anymore)

Boy you must be crazy (boy you must be crazy)
Thinking you can take me from my baby (thinking you can take me from my baby)
Can't you see that he's the only one that i adore
Don't need you anymore (i don't need you no more)
Don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
