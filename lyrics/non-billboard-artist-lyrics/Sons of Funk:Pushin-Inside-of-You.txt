Pushin-Inside-of-You:Sons of Funk
You know, I know it's gonna be good girl
I can feel your water streaming down all around
Here's my love, am I qualified in your eyes?
I can feel myself deeper, deeper inside (pushin' in yo body)
Ohhhhh... lay you by my side I'll let you light my fire I can see it in your eyes

Sho' feels damn good to me
When I'm pushin' inside of you (pushin' inside you)
Can't explain the way it feels
All I wanna do is be wit' you (all I wanna do is be wit' you)

Okay, enough of that four play
Somethings telling me that
Your body's soaking wet
So, here's my love, am I qualified in your eyes?
I can feel myself deeper, deeper inside (pushin' in your body)
Ohhhh.lay you by my side
I'll let you light my fire
I can see it in your eyes

Ummm... it's gonna be good girlLet's go all night, all night
La da da, la da da, la da da, laaaaaa
