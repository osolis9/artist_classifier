He-Loves-Me-Lyzel-In-E-Flat-Movements-I-II-III:Jill Scott
You love me especially different every time
You keep me on my feet happily excited
By your cologne, your hands
Your smile, your intelligence

You woo me, you court me
You tease me, you please me
You school me, give me some things to think about

Ignite me, you invite me
You co-write me, you love me
You like me, you incite me to Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You love me especially different every time
You keep me on my feet happily excited
By your cologne and your hands
Your smile, your intelligence

You woo me, you court me
You tease me, you please me
You school me, give me things to think about

Invite me, you ignite me
Co-write me, you love me
You like me, incite me to Sa ra ra ra
Ra ra ra
Doo doo doo
Ooh, doo, doo

You're different and special
You're different and special
In every way imaginable

You love me from my hair follicles to my toenails
You got me feeling like the breeze
Easy and free and lovely and new

Aww, when you touch me I just can't control it
When you touch me, I just can't hold it
The emotion inside of me, I can feel it

Aah
Aah
Aah
I don't know
