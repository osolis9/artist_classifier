Typical-American:The Goats
Chorus: [all]
I'm not, your, typical american

I'm not, your, typical american

[oatie kato]
Tell me whose is whose, tell me who is on the microphone
I'm oatie of the goaties and i propose i would like a bone
Ta edge off the dredge i'm alleged to have sparked a joint
I speak political and blisstical i really hope ya like my points
I aim at a target like rife not a shotgun
Don't spray into the fray ta prove that i got one
Hyde ya hose from aaron, rose cause he knows how ta top one
'sgot a nose for the prose so don't suppose he will stop son
I'm rollin' into this rhyme like ya'd bite a tendoroni
I'm rollin' into this rap cause it's mine and ya know me
I won't mind defy or sing like toni tone
Singing for the supper like a dog does a boni

[madd]
George get off my jock cause i'm really gettin' tired a this shit
So step back dan and throw up those fist
Cause i'm a wreck shop and i turn this motherfucker out
Pay what is due me less i'm going up in your mouth
Yup yup i got the rhymes ta kick your butt
It be the g-o-a-t the m-a-d-d say what
Up hus i got bucks yeah i be on the 2 bus
So what's up i got nuff respect ta make ya jump
Welfare receiver with the north side attitude
I've had the shit piled up like in multitudes
Nappy headed, holey shoed, roundin' out the roster fist
Ya wanna step you better check the green monster first

[swayzack]
I don't pretend to be a nice guy so why ya try
I can go to plan b and you can get an eye jammy
So save the sob story for a storybook and look
Jack-in-the-box can take a lickin' but i'm never gettin' took
By uncle scam and his band of political crooks
Searchin' nooks and crannies of my grammy's pocketbook
Hello hello can ya hear me now g
The typical american kid that ain't me
Neither is oatie or the m a double d
So pass the dutchie on the left-hand side
And don't hide the crop cause i the e-z-wides
I'm gonna survive not suck seed, cause i stand as a man
And you can't hand me no bird feed

Chorus

[oatie]
Pop goes ya head like the top of a daisy
Ya ghost when the world hits like patrick swayze
Crazy this shit about a plausible denial
North takes the rap while ya clap at the trial
Pie
