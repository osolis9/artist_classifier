In-Your-Eyes:Unique & Dashan
Baby this was meant to be cause I can't find a reason*
To beg you to stay when you tell me that you're leaving
I know we're young and love comes in and out of season
But in a kind of strange there this is a breeze ghetto
But you I try to pretend like I'm really hurt when you say I ain't putting work
To keep you, but I bear through
I can't find another man up girl
When I look into your eyes girl, I can't laugh for one minute
Cause my just heart just ain't in it
When I look into your eyes girl, wish I felt the same when it's a way...
When I look into your eyes girl, I can say you let down
But it's best you know now,
Baby you go is necessary, cause my conscience was too heavy
Even if it makes you cry, can now when I look in your eyes

You could blame me if you want cause I can't do this no more
I'm sorry but my heart ain't made like it was before
I understand if you don't call no more
You deserve that good, gonna give real life into you
But you I try to pretend like I'm really hurt when you say I ain't putting work
To keep you, but I bear through
I can't find another man up girl
When I look into your eyes girl, I can't laugh for one minute
Cause my just heart just ain't in it
When I look into your eyes girl, wish I felt the same when it's a way...
When I look into your eyes girl, I can say you let down
But it's best you know now,
Baby you go is necessary, cause my conscience was too heavy
Even if it makes you cry, can now when I look in your eyes

You cry and it's best I let you know
There's no need holding on to something just for show
I guess I was in denial, I help it girl I really wanna tell the truth
But I'm doing what every dude would do
It's best you, don't wait no time
Cause girl, when I look into your eyes, I can't laugh for one minute
Cause my just heart just ain't in it
When I look into your eyes girl, wish I felt the same when it's a way...
When I look into your eyes girl, I can say you let down
But it's best you know now,
Baby you go is necessary, cause my conscience was too heavy
Even if it makes you cry, can now when I look in your eyes

When I look into your eyes girl, I can't laugh for one minute
Cause my just heart just ain't in it
When I look into your eyes girl, wish I felt the same but it's late...
When I look into your eyes girl, I can say you let down
But it's best you know now,
Baby you go is necessary, cause my conscience was too heavy
Even if it makes you cry, can now when I look in your eyes
When I look in your eyes,
Said it's hurt to see you cry.
