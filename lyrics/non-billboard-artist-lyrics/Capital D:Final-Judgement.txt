Final-Judgement:Capital D
And you were warned of the outcome but you didn't listen
Led by the greed and the ways of the system
Now wells in addiction and sin is a (lury?)
Now you must learn that hell isn't (burying?)

You fight and you get but you can't shape the grip
Judge what was clear as skills at the hip
Lived like a King but now you're dead
Forced to reflect, remember what you said

Religion is rhetoric only to be used to your personal advantage
Only when you choose the best of the time he was blind to defect
Now you face the fire no turning back

You walked down a path now, look where it took you
Your collection of possessions forsook you
Time isn't gold that you thought was forever
And now in the hands of the Devil is the clever

Shades how walk on me you to the your prison
Of infinite misery that none can envision
Treating the choir, passing a prediction
Warned of the outcome but you didn't listen

Time is elapsin, walls are collapsin
Summers are comin, And earth is a fasting
Patiently waiting while in the midst of the (caught in the .?)
He did this, breathin this foul air eating this foul food
Getting dissed by your bliss cuz of this fool mood
This bliss from the list of the righteous few
They follow mirages like

Its true the laws you thought were a myth
Its true your path led straight off the cliff
Its due to you that you still won't admit, come
Fuck you were fake but you still won't submit

The gurards in your cell are your lifelong enemies
Now you advance to be for infinity
throught the back and needle to the eye
you feel all the pain but you can't re-die

Can't lie even now you are not a believer
Caught in the midst of the devilish deceiver
You only wish they should switch the position
Inflict the pain and mercilessly rip them

Sweet retribution set forth a (turned a?)
Tables on your guardians but you never learned
Never earned forgiveness cuz you don't forgive
You burn even now cuz this is how you

Drunk off a power and lonely to possess
Seeking to??? stress with???? bless
Having sex like a beast so a beast we shall be
As you lock you're on cell and throw away the key. key.
