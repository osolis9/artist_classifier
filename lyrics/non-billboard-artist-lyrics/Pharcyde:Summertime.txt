Summertime:Pharcyde
Summertime

Hot short days
Long sweaty nights
The changing of the equinox

Its summertime
And the livins easy
ridies on the microphone
With ras m.g.
All people in dance will agree
That we're well qualified
To represent the LBC 
Me, me and lawee
We go run to the party
And dance to the rhythm
It gets harder.

I was delayed on delta
Thinking about my shelter
In Pasadena when a man
I was emphazema
Let the top down
Turn the volume up some decibels
And rolling down the street
Ass all up on my testicals like lice
Summertime is always nice
From dena to the l.b.c.
And start driving the telly 301
Time jump behind me
Flashing lights like a disco
Was lookin like Danny terrio
herbs in scenario 
Its summertime.

Its summertime
And the livins easy
ridies on the microphone
With ras m.g.
All people in dance will agree
That we're well qualified
To represent the LBC 
Me, me and lawee
We go run to the party
And dance to the rhythm
It gets harder.

Days hotter than coco
As smooth as coco butter
My mind was cluttered 
With thoughts of being home
My zone, closing my shutters
Imagine the microphones
And lying under the covers
With my baby bear
Banging with dreamy stairs
Shoulder shoulder then hair
Put a nigga's underwear
With the baby T
Whispering words like
"Come and... Play with me"
What a beautiful day to be free
That is it.

Evil
I've come to tell you that she's
Evil
Most definitely
Evil
Ornery, scandalous and
Evil
Most definitely.
The tension
Is getting hotter
I’d like to pull her
Head underwater

You know it’s seasonal
Temperatures reading exactly at 
1. 0 .1
Ran into sublime when I was 
Rollin high on the 
101
northbound in tune with the earth sound
sound wave and the sun beams
when im on the microphone
I freak beats and rearrange scenes
When im on the microphone
I make heads bob
We smoke hella herbs
Cause herb attracts the gods.

(You gotta gotta gotta keep it comin on)

one day I was joggin through the concrete jungle
and all of a sudden I slipped on some SUBLIME
and landed in the pharcyde
its all good, it doesn’t matter
we have sunshine in the air
good smoke and good people everywhere
you know 
I know
We must stay strong
And keep it, keep it comin on.
