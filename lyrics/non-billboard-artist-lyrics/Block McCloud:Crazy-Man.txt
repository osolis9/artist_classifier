Crazy-Man:Block McCloud
Doctor, what is the matter bitch?
The inmates gotten a hold of a gun, I think they're trying to escape
What? I think It's the guy Block

Doctor tellin me I maybe mad maybe
It's cause we're living in this crazy land I'm a
Crazy man, crazy man, in a crazy land, crazy land X 2

I feel disconnected, distant, separate, different, desperate dissed like disco records
Which direction should I spit this weapon?
My finger's itching and I'm pissed I'm stressing
This aggression is risky business
You think I'm missin, wishful thinkin
I'm sick and twisted, off crystal method
I miss my brethren, my bitch, the freshest
Explicit lyrics I see it in a pussy like I'm possessed by the spirit of a lesbian midget
They chasin me listen, guards are takein a shot at me
They made an incision my brains a lobotomy,
They mad I Started a crazy religion, instead of breaking out of jail
We're raiding the prison
Taking no prisoners, i'm making them soldiers
This crazy land we're living in, i'm taking it over

Doctor tellin me I maybe mad maybe
It's cause we're living in this crazy land I'm a
Crazy man, crazy man, in a crazy land, crazy land X 2

I escaped from Arkham make my way through dark lands
We whilen like its planet of apes and i'm Tarzan
With gods hand, I rule with my skill and a iron fist
And I can't cure it cause I killed my psychiatrist
The pills and snort vitamins, the crowd spills toward the sirens
Fuck where my lost souls, and we will resort to violence
Got shot up with the Nazi virus, when I was locked up in the asylum
Now I'm godly and im a tyrant
I'm a product of my environment
This land it's twisted, It made me what I am
I'ma stand my position I'm a man on a mission
I'm a tool with precision, this planet is fucked
It's screwed, cause i'm twisted, i'm a bananas
I'm Nuts.In your mouth
And ya mad cause you can't figure out
How to figure me out, or what triggers McCloud
We will shit, in your house as we run through your city
With a gun and 150??, come get me

Doctor tellin me I maybe mad maybe
It's cause we're living in this crazy land I'm a
Crazy man, crazy man, in a crazy land, crazy land X 2

I'm psychopathic like Michael Jackson
Tried to wipe some asses that'll diaper rashes
It's my right of passage that I light these matches
And ignite these gases, i'm a spiteful bastard
O.J. Simpson he's riding with us
Jessica Simpson is driving a bus
And Robert Blake also locked in that place
Just got shot in the face by the cops on the chase
It's like Grand Theft Auto, got a hand, now auto matic
But can't die, not a man, I'm immortal
I'm a cancer spreading, cross the land and deserts
Theres a method to the madness
And a madness to the method
I got anger and aggression
Was abandoned and rejected
When they plan is intervention, family handed me a weapon
Now me and Gary Busey, got our motorcycles
Waging war with an army of soldiers that are psycho

Doctor tellin me I maybe mad maybe
It's cause we're living in this crazy land I'm a
Crazy man, crazy man, in a crazy land, crazy land X 2

(SCRATCHING)I drove myself mad, lurching for sanityâ€¦
Crazy man, crazy man.
