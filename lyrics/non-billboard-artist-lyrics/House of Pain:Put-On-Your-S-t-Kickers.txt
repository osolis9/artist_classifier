Put-On-Your-S-t-Kickers:House of Pain
Yeah, check it out now
Everybody check it out now

Yo, I got the corn beef
I got the moz
I got the shotty
Ay yo, I got the buck shot

Ay yo, I got the burgers
I got the grill
If you're steppin' up next
Ya better flex that skill

The House Of Pain is in full effect
Everybody in the place give full respect
If your girl's in the house keep the ho' in check
And if I'm bustin' off caps, you better hit the deck

Steppin' on stage with the fly routines
I'm hemmin' up suckers like bell bottom jeans
I always switch trains in Jamaica, Queens
When I go to by the street to see my Aunt Ilene

Danny Boy's comin' with the Irish style
The money back guarantee, I make it worth your while
I'm layin' out fools like kitchen tile
You come around with a frown, and ya leave in a pile

Step back man, I ain't a black man
But every time I grab the mike I rock a phat jam
Without the Slimfast, and if I skim past
You know I step up and get a ho' with gym blast

I give her what she wants, even if she fronts
The Hill is down with the House, they got the philly blunts
Ya know we roll 'em up, and then we light 'em up
And then we puff them up and pass them so Danny Boy blasts 'em

I got the shell-toe Adidas, with the fat strings
The Celtic crosses and the Claddagh rings
The straight edges razor and the marther pump
You heard me shit clickin', now it's time to jump

Jump around just like a frog on a log
Fuck the Dukes because I like Boss Hogg
I'm hittin' home runs like my man Wade Boggs
And if you try to act stupid, I'm droppin' the dogs

Every time I go to town
People start kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if my dog's a hound
You better stop kickin' my dog around

Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit

Now I've droppin' records since the age of seventeen
First I came solo, but I now I got a team
It's the four man crew, with the Irish stew
You catch us puffin' on a blunt, and sippin' a brew

What's up with that brew, man, hurry up and finish
Now grab the bar maid and order me another Guiness
You can drink the Guiness while I'm sippin' on the mickeys
When it comes to hookers, yo, the Everlast is picky

Always got my hat in case I come across a quicky
And when I do my shows I get the hoes all hot and sticky

The House Of Pain is in full effect, yeah
I say the House Of Pain is in full effect
You know the House Of Pain is in full effect, yeah
And anyone who steps up is gettin' wrecked

Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit

Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit

Check it out now
