ohhhh nooo
I don't know if I should be here be here
ohhhh nooo
I don't know if I should be here be here
yo what is life if you can't make the most of it
what is love if u can't get the hold of it
what's a smile when your not really happy
wake up everyday with a frown feeling crappy
tell me what is laughter when you just wanna cry and life is a disaster and you just die
nobody understand how you feel deep inside but you gotta stay strong with your head held high
I got so many question yeah
why is life such a bitch when you least expected it
And how does everybody have it all figured as I sit and pown this shit is so depressing
Fuck
I'm so emotional I guess these are the thoughts of a broken soul with a broken heart outspoken mind I'm trynna find who i am in this path of mine
but I don't know, I don't know
Its been a long time since I felt like myself
I might as well grab the 9 and take the safety off
and let the bullet pierce right through my scalp
shit I need help
shit I need help
shit I need help
I don't really know who the fuck I can turn too
I try to take my time and listen to advice
see I was told Patience is a Virtue
But I'm sick and tired of being sick of life
fuck tommorow I wanna die tonight fuck the future fuck the present fuck the drama yo fuck the stressing fuck the judgements
fuck the assumptions fuck the ones who made me feel like nothing fuck'em all yo I'm done talking stay the fuck away when I'm inside my coffin, yow
Ohhh Noooo I don't know if I should be here be here Everyday is a burden for me so many regrets it discourages me
like where would I be if i didn't drop out and I kept taking classes and grandma was proud
and where would I be if my father was here and mom was with and there love was sincere
no fucking divorce no need for the course together forever they fought through the storms
They fought through it all
Yeah to the trials of love they never quit but is sad to say that's not the case because they broke apart
that shit makes me piss
yo fuck yo fuck
Do I give up or do I stand on my feet
Do I give into the hardships of life living every single day as I die on my knees
shit
What should I do
What should I do
Do I hold on to this thing called life do I stay strong when there's tears in my eyes do I move on when I'm hurting inside
Where do I go
Where do I go
Under the ground when In finally at peace away from the world away from the sorrow and pain that's has been hidden with in me so deep
ohhh lord...
ohhhh noo
