The-Last-Goodbye:Liberty X
Hey, ooh, hey
C'mon
Yeah
Oh
Yeah

Never thought that I could feel the way I feel
Summer's over, clouds appear
And all that's left are memories
The sands of time rush by, oh

Can't even believe that this has been
More than a daydream
In the silence as the waves crash
We can run from our uncertainties
There's only you and I

So I've had my cry, no more tears tonight
'Cos the stars are shining brightly in the sky
So lay down with me
I wanna touch ya like the breeze
This could be our last goodbye, oh

Anytime that you need
Somebody by your side, I'll be there
Anywhere that you leave
You leave a piece of you behind, this I swear

You've made a better person out of me
For knowing you, nowhere left to hide
But while we're outta sight
There's no right or wrong tonight

As the dawn is breaking
And the darkness turns to daylight
We release one another from the warmth
That kept us safe at night
There's nowhere left to run

Wish that I could stay a while
Lost in you forever
Maybe I'm not strong enough to face alone
The threat of stormy weather
Blinded by the sun

So I've had my cry, no more tears tonight
'Cos the stars are shining brightly in the sky
So lay down with me
I wanna touch ya like the breeze
This could be our last goodbye, oh

Anytime that you need
Somebody by your side, I'll be there
Anywhere that you leave
You leave a piece of you behind, this I swear

You've made a better person out of me
For knowing you, nowhere left to hide
But while we're outta sight
There's no right or wrong tonight

Hardly can believe the time has come
I gotta leave you lonely
I knew that it was just a little fun
But it's not so easy

I know it's getting harder to let go
But even though I'm gonna miss you so
Time to face reality, oh

Anytime that you need
Somebody by your side, I'll be there
Anywhere that you leave
You leave a piece of you behind, this I swear

You've made a better person out of me
For knowing you, nowhere left to hide
But while we're outta sight
There's no right or wrong tonight

Anytime that you need
Somebody by your side, I'll be there
Anywhere that you leave
You leave a piece of you behind, this I swear

You've made a better person out of me
For knowing you, nowhere left to hide
But while we're outta sight
There's no right or wrong tonight
