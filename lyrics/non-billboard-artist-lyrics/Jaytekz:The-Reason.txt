Yeah I must admit that your pretty close to perfect
Everytime I see your smile, I get kind of nerves
I want to tell you how i feel
But i aint build the courage
to be completely real your the one i want to cherish
I know we're only friends but i can show you much more
and i can keep you warm when the rain starts to pour
I promise you ima keep you calm through every storm
and ima hold you in my palms because your soul i do adore.
Now, i aint trynna scare you off man
Thats why i keep this to myself in my thoughts man
I never knew that you would really make me fall man.
I never knew that love could really be this stron man.
But here i fall deeper every second
My hearts starts skipping everytime your name is mentioned
I know I sound corny yo,
But fuck it, I ain't trynna front
I ain't trynna miss my chance yo cause you could be the one
So let me show you get back and hold you
When you're feeling lost I can be the one you go to
Know you, probably catching the same vibes
I feel it in your smile when I'm staring into your eyes, Lord.
I guess I got it pretty bad huh?
Cause every time you come around I start to act up I start stuttering and choking on my words
I'm hoping there's so much here, but I think it's ready to disperse.
I said I think it's ready to disperse.
So ima tell you how I feel even if it hurts cause nothings guaranteed
so ima take my chance and if you feel the same baby you can take my hands
and I am not letting go even if the sky Is falling.
I hold you tight by my side fixing all my problems
and I ain't giving up on you cause your the one for me
if this is real it should last us an eternity, this should last us an eterinty.
If this is real it should last us an eternity
