Rock-n-Roll:Big Black Lincoln
where is my heart
they ask me, i dont know
i swallowed my pride and still they say i runnin down the wrong road
i'm lookin inside myself and truly i can't see nothing wrong
so where do i hide, oh no i don't cuz i'm too strong
i ready to fly, im itchin to go
im looking for way to convince my soul
i'm singing my pain this is rocking roll
i'm ready to fly, im itching, im singing my pain this is rockn roll
so playa singing yo rockin roll
soldier playa yo rockin roll

in time of hurt, good things come to those who wait
but ive been here waitin oh so long, its getting way too late
now what do i love form this percpective seems like i gotta change my objective andn climb over the frozen rhine
whoa
im ready to fly, im itchin to go ive looking for way to convince my soul
im ready to fly, im itchin to go i'm singing my pain this is rockn roll
so playa singing yo rockin roll
playa singling yo rocking rll
so playa singing yo rockin roll

in this game called life, weve got nothing to lose
way to survive, stuck to my shoes
work is slaving, death is freedom
money gives me option while i question my reason

in this game called life, im stuck in the blues.
ill sing while you cry, no one wants you to choose
money gives me option while i question my reason
my home, my turf
my gift has born my curse
everytime i got a move on, you turn bad to worse

i got a fine for this objective, seems like im living in my perspective
youll find that im too strong to lie whoa

im ready to fly, im itchin to go ive looking for way to convince my soul
im ready to fly, im itchin to go i'm singing my pain this is rockn roll
so playa singing yo rockin roll
playa singling yo rocking rll
so playa singing yo rockin roll
playa yo rocking roll
