Everything-Stops-for-Tea:Professor Elemental
You're sitting at your desk
The report is due in by three
And its ten past now, but for heavens sake
Its still about time for tea

Or your wife or husband left you
Taking kids, furniture and the keys
Well pull yourself together, keep calm and carry on
Take time out for tea

A superhero saves the world from a fiendish villain spree
Needs to get back to the batcave
Where Alfred has got the tea

A captain on the oceans hits an iceberg and might freeze
But before he mans the lifeboats, well there is still time for tea!

Its a very good English custom
Though the weather be cold or hot
If you need a little pickup
Pour a little teacup
It'll always hit the spot
The soldiers may be fighting
In trenches or in battles in the sea
But there isn't any war when the clock strikes four
Everything stops for tea!

One... two... three... four: everything stops for tea!
One... two... three... four: everything stops for tea!
One... two... three... four: everything stops for tea!
One... two... three... four: everything stops for tea!

This truly mighty empire
Wasn't built in an afternoon
Cause we had to stop for muffins and stuffed buttered crumpets
And a fresh pot brewed for two

Gameskeeper or a poacher
Whether lord or a cleaner of the loo
Whether rich or poor when the clock strikes four you know just what to do!

When queen Vic ran the country, she was grumpy then my friends
Just a little bit of puff and a pot of brown stuff and it picked her up again
If your life is filled with hardships, well that's awful poor old you
But you'll always have me and you'll always have tea, so come on and pour that brew!

Its a very good English custom
Though the weather be cold or hot
If you need a little pickup
Pour a little teacup
It'll always hit the spot
The soldiers may be fighting
In trenches or in battles in the sea
But there isn't any war when the clock strikes four
Everything stops for tea!
