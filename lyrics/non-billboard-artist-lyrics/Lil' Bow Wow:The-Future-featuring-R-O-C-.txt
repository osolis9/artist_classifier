Beware Of Dog
The Future (featuring R.O.C.)
I'm off tha chains
I'm off tha chians

[chorus]
Have you ever seen me, I'm tha future
I represent how it's gonna be, I'm tha future
Born in 1987, I'm tha future
Party people get ready, its' tha future
I don't know about ya'll but I know about me, and when I think about tha future, I'm all I see
Cuz I'm tha future
[Bow Wow]
Im somethin your not
I'm just right with the spot
Every jam I make gotta go knock, knock
The biggest thing since Hugo
U know, ya'll cats do a whole lot, but i do mo' believe me
I'm loose now runnin' at full speed
Like tha juice now back in '73
Ya heard me
Had to, Im that lil bad dude
Wit JD
I'm tha A in the hit
I'm the prince of the click
What you think keep makin shorty have them fits
It's tha B capital O-W-wow
Like Moe Dee, how u like me now 
Tryna do it real big like Kris and them
But if this thing don't work, I'm above the rim, Between the legs, and behind tha back
Yeah I'm small but I got that
Now tell me
[chorus]
(R.O.C)
Now Look up ahead dats me
Far beyond the flow is gone come on
U know the kid is crazy
Like Britney Spears
And I'm in the prime of my years    Oh yeah
I know what pops up in ya head first is( wait  a minute)
How  he keep coming up with verses (uh huh)
Well I'm gonna tell ya something and don't  get nervous
My secret is I'm doin it on purpose (why)
To get a billioncopies purchased
If your style is sick (well)
Mine is allergic
My rhymes in the beat merges like interstate traffic (ooh my)
It's just a habit
I flow it
I know it 'll probably  illegal
Before the o's before you
Even close to being the COR
Even backwards I'm the hard
And I give my reagards
But I aint rapping With ya'll
I'm a year after tommorow


You can't see me I'm the future
I represent how it's gonna be
I'm the future
Born in '79
I'm the future
Party people get ready, it's the future.
