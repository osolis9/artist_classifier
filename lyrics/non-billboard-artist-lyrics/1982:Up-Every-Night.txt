Up-Every-Night:1982
Statik Selektah & Termanology
Im up every night doing sleep
Every mid night, I let this shit
Ever night
I aint worried bout you girl tryin to party
You could going do your thing dont even call me
Lose no sleep Im on the creep
Free she gonna need no sheets
Im a one a one, bitch better understand
You know Im feeling my begin the dance
Swag on the hundred gram bag like a hundred grams
And thats just my hair stash with my.
If I quick stand well I forget tomorrow
See it on facebook myself with my sorrow
See me, and I dont give a f*ck Ill be acting like a dude
But I do shit every month
Ive been drinking and puffing and smoking
Someone call me a lush
Me I call it a rush
I got a lot of homies thats tracked open the clush
Really I think they dust cause me I live it up
Im up every night doing sleep
Every mid night, every night
Im up every night doing sleep
Every mid night, every night
After party my crib is going down
Micky ask for drink this plenty going around
Fresh from the club I order the couple rounds
So this people passing out and throw it .
Hundreds with the hills
Swagging with a hundred mill
We can chillin doing anything that you feel
cause Im just a regular guy breath smelling like patron
With the blush.and my mean so fly you should be a stewardess
I could tell you and doing this smoking and puffing .shti
Great goose with a little bit of OJay
In the room and ready to roll play
Pennies flyin all and she ready to try it all
What you call havin a ball
And when I wake up Ill be missing everything
And guess what next week we gonna do it again
Im up every night doing sleep
Every mid night, every night
Im up every night doing sleep
Every mid night, every night
Its driving me out of my mind
Thats why its hard for me to find
Cant get her out of my hed
Kiss her, dease her
I think her friend instead
Im up every night doing sleep
Every mid night, every night
Im up
