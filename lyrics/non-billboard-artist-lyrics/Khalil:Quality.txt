Quality:Khalil
Shawty know what's up, it's never too late
She don't wanna waste my time
It's like soon as I get up and she like wait
Wish that I could playback time

I could give a fuck 'bout what people say
I don't pay them no mind
It's like I never get enough, won't you come away
This shit gonna take some time
All I want is time, oh no
I said I can never get enough
Some quality time for you
I said I can never get enough

Shawty know what's up, it's never too late
She don't wanna waste my time
Guessing that she keep me up, we turn up the bed
I can't even make my mind

I could give a fuck 'bout what people say
I don't pay them no mind
It's like I never get enough, won't you come away
This shit gonna take some time
All I want is time, oh no
I said I can never get enough
Some quality time for you
I said I can never get enough

Shawty know what's up, it's never too late
She don't wanna waste my time
