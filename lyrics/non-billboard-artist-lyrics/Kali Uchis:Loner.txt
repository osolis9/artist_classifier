Loner:Kali Uchis
I don't want to be your cigarette
I don't want to be your ashtray
I don't want to be your door mat
'Don't want to be ignored
All o' sudden you're not into me
And maybe it's not deliberate
And I know you never asked me
I just gotta put it out there
I don't pull myself out there
Usually I stay tucked away
Cause I was a loner until I met you

And I let you in after all the persuasion
Mind games, manipulations.
That's why I'd rather be a loner
Yeah I'd rather be alone
I don't even want to know ya
I don't want to be known
Cause I'd rather be a loner

I'd much rather be alone

Baby it was nice to know ya
Packing up and leaving home.
No I don't want to be your cigarette
Use me up then toss me, step on om
I don't want to be an option
Avoidin' interactions cause I just wanna get away
And maybe you got a full plate
Know I'm cookin' up something better
but if you don't want me now
No boy I don't want you later

Don't try to come eat with me
Cause I was a loner until I met you

And I let you in after all the persuasion
headaches and allegations.
That's why I'd rather be a loner
Yeah I'd rather be alone
I don't even want to know ya
I don't want to be known
Cause I'd rather be a loner
I'd much rather be alone
Baby it was nice to know ya
Packing up and leaving home.
