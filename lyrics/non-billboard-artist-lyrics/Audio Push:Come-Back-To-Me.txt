Come-Back-To-Me:Audio Push
Man, just relax
Girl you talkin outta anger
Got me feelin alone like a kid stuck in a chamber
Now I can’t believe it like that rapper turned singer
Corey lost his Tapanga
You treat me like a stranger
Havin twitter wars girl we were so sloppy
You took me, gave me, you held me then you dropped me
I told you in that hotel room girl that you got me
The key you hold to my heart locksmith’s can’t copy
Baby I was your Rocky and you were my Adrienne
But you wanna concern yourself with the drama that they be in
Told me you hate me, you pushed me and you shoved me
It must be opposite day cause I know that you love me
So come back in my world babe, and put your bags down
We been fightin this fight but girl we at the last round
I gave you my life, there’s nothin else to live the world can see that I got nothin else to give, cause

I gave you my all and I did everything you asked me
But now you’re mad at me, tellin me that you have to leave
You took the paintings off of the wall, when I thought we had a masterpiece
So why you have to leave, pretty lady come back to me
Pretty lady come back to me

Relationships, you the girl I had in down pat with
Every time it rained you knew you could have my jacket
I’d say we were the Ken and Barbie but that’s so plastic
Cause we were so in love that our friends thought we practiced
At least that’s what I thought guess that I was wrong
But now I’m here head down mashing out this song
Cause everything you thought was off I just knew was on
I guess I just gotta accept my best friend is gone
My best friend, my girl
My girl meaning she
She meaning you
Us meaning two
I’m on this phone late from my show, bus is leavin too
I’m tryna figure out how no more us is even true
It’s all gotta be false, this gotta be a dream
And the story where heart breaks has gotta be the theme
I guess everything isn’t what it seems
Too good to be true, naw its too good to believe because I

I gave you my all and I did everything you asked me
But now you’re mad at me, tellin me that you have to leave
You took the paintings off of the wall, when I thought we had a masterpiece
So why you have to leave, pretty lady come back to me
Yeah, pretty lady come back to me

Baby we took time, wasn’t so much to ask
You were quick to go off, I was so fast to let it pass
Don’t know where we went wrong, I just knew that we would last
Leavin’s like throwing a Pablo Piccasso in the trash
So I ask myself all the time was it worth it
Lookin at you and me was like lookin at something perfect
But now all I’m lookin at is something that is worthless
I wish that somebody could tell me where that special girl is
Cause I been searching for her, baby I thought you felt me
Tryna find the directions mapquest can’t even help me
You were so fast to leave, and seemed so slow to try and work it out
Send text messages but I still get no reply
Baby I need you back, my fire lost the fuse
We were the best team girl and I refuse to lose
I just got one wish, I need you to grant it please
I’m bruised from being on my hands and knees, cause I

I gave you my all and I did everything you asked me
But now you’re mad at me, tellin me that you have to leave
You took the paintings off of the wall, when I thought we had a masterpiece
So why you have to leave, pretty lady come back to me

I gave you my all and I did everything you asked me
But now you’re mad at me, tellin me that you have to leave
You took the paintings off of the wall, when I thought we had a masterpiece
So why you have to leave, pretty lady come back to me
Pretty lady come back to me

Back to me
