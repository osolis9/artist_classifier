Nationwide-Rip-Ridaz:Crips
I cast out cased up loc locked down i'm a menace
I gives it up i give a fuck a loc for life cuz i'm with it
I see fresh dressed like a million bucks
I am the lowest rip rida in the navy blue chucks
Not the low top type cuz they slip and they slide
With the high tops and the gangstaz with the stars on the side
I'm buckin all brands all slobs bitches and tricks
And i'm from eastside fushtown mafia crip
Watts up to my homiez on the 10 and the 5
In the cut on the street gettin paid on the front line
I rob for c side, death to my enemy
Mission to make a mill and chill with my big gz
I got a heat for you slob niggaz slippin
Set trippin is my favorite pastime loc cuz i'm crippin
See a slob if he swerve too deep in a suburban
Pull up close to the curb, get up close so i can serve him
Ain't no mercey or grace
Put him in his place
Make every bullet count so put a slug in his face
Nationwide eastside watts franklin square crip ride
