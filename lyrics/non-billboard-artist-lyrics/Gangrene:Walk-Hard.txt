Walk-Hard:Gangrene
[Featuring: Johnny Cash]

[Hook]

When I die I’m takin’ the dog with me
You gon have to find and rob my grave like hippie
I got a Jones walkin’ the city like they’re hitchhikers
Last script writer, y’all ain’t rappers or dick riders
Tryna call my click spider there’s none higher that I admire
Throw ‘em up with their shoes tied over the wires
We’re tired, stop in the long road, harder than the pavement
I shake shift, that’s why Kali Holmes ain’t got basements
Face it, I’m a threat to your era
Bifocals I need just to see this shit clearer
That feelin’, you feel the sense of danger gettin’ nearer
I’m Jack so pay close to the perception from the mirror
Open caps for the chips like Pringles
I put hits on your man just like some flippers
I got funk in the champ and while it lingers
I keep my hands in that cheese, we call it Cheeto fingers

[Hook]

See me creepin’, be up in the spot with somethin’ decent
Another day, another dollar, yea another reason
Body bags, ice duffle for me to put the cheese in
When it come to that pork we put the greeze in
Easy off the flake pedal and start breazin’
I’m like the wind, light is pliff, I’m ridin’ gemstone
No key shuffle in the end zone
First of all, we the one and only, others is phony
Double G cronies, way I but ‘em in the head
If they don’t come up with my bread I leave ‘em dead and lonely
Just a satisfactory snack on categories
Rap rap on the track like a laboratory rat
Now how real is that?
My cup on the dover with dope, I spill the crack
