I-m-Back:June Luva
[June Luva]
Yo, it's funny how niggas in the game, take niggas names
And eat off another man's image, yo, that's just a same
And other rappers turn and give 'em respect
Well I'mma straight up do the opposite and give them this tech
And give 'em all 17 shots from the glock, I'm popping ya top
You going to hell, you like it or not
And that goes for anybody out trynna take mine
If a mini me's rapping, then he better be mine
Meaning my son, my seed, if not, he gon' bleed
They can take this out of context, but shall I proceed?
Look, I'm from the Island of Staten, and everybody
Ain't a dusthead, so disregard what that fuck said
And Nas, god, you did us dirty, I don't know
The politics being it, but you better speak out quick
How the fuck you gonna make a video in every borugh
And forget about the most thorough, that shit is crazy

[Chorus: June Luva (Lil' Kim sample)]
Fuck that (bitches don't deserve to rap) hell nah
(And I'm about to murder cats) yeah, yeah
(And I'm about to murder cats) that's right, that's right
Check it, fuck that, ya'll niggas don't deserve to rap
(And I'm about to murder cats) that's right, that's right
(And I'm about to murder cats) word, word, check it
