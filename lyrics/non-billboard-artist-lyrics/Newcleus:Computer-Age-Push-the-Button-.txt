Computer-Age-Push-the-Button-:Newcleus
Are we under their control, or are they under our control, or what?>


Push the button

Computer age is now
Everyone must have a machine
They say it's gonna make life easier,
well, I can't stand it...

They say we should put them in control
Well, maybe next we'll give them a soul
I guess we must now think that we're gods,
While we're less men than ever

I know the Lord cannot be too glad
In fact, I'm sure he must be quite mad
To see us take His role from our lives
And give it to computers

For here we sit in our easy chairs
As our machines decide how we'll fare
Who will suffer, who will survive?
It's up to the computers

Push the button!





Push the button!





"I'm no longer in control
I can't program my machine
Now it wants to take my soul
Stop it or it will proceed!"
