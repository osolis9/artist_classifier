[Kid Cudi:]
I said it's time to put your hands in the air,
And wave them around like you just don't care, yeah,
It's time to put your hands in the air,
And wave them around like you just don't care, yeah,
It's time to put your hands in the air,
And wave them around like you just don't care,
Ok mr. moon man, has arrived,
And to them lame n-ggas, keep the middle finger high,
I'm kinda like my mind, would you mind if we fly,
Now climb in the metaphor, talkin bout G4,

[Hook:]
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want,
Whatever you want, want, want, want, want, want, want,

[Common:]
Whatever you want, you could quit your day job,
You could be my Kate, I could be your A-Rod,
Christian Louboutin telling you could model,
Not you, a real housewife of Chicago,

[Repeat Hook:]

[Big Sean:]
Yeah, B-I, G, look,
To all the Halle Berrys and the younger Tony Braxtons,
It's time to cut, glad you made the casting,
Look at my jewelry, damn it's just flashin,
Not only do I love it, I love it with a passion,

[Repeat Hook:]

[Kanye West:]
Ayo I pull up in the, errr umm, Benz,
And the girls say, ah, like they imitatin Prince, ok,
When I circle the block, hop in,
Me, you and your friends, that's a win win win,
Do whatever you want,

[Repeat Hook:]

[Consequence:]
Ladies this is in your best interest like a feminist,
And going out with him don't come with benefits,
Then why would you even wanna reminisce?
When you could apply in time for a membership,
And get whatever you want, want, want, want, want

[Kanye West:]
Now it's time to put your hands in the air,
And wave them around like you just don't care,

[Consequence:]
And once your done with that keep your hands up high,
And if you with your girl let me see you get live,

[John Legend:]
Hey girl, we gon live it up tonight,
Hey girl, welcome to the grammy life,
Hey girl, you know hows this goes, doesn't get old, centerfold, is all I know,
Whatever you want,

[Consequence:]
You would think I would recycle by the way I found my last chick,
Cause all she want is paper or plastic,
And won't be happy until she find herself a draft pick,
Or a D-boy with money in the mattress,
So raise up your glasses, and let's toast to the good life,

[Repeat Hook:]

[Big Sean:]
So go ahead, you can drink whatever that you like to,
Champagne, remy, or a little bit of sky blu,
Yeah we up in VI, I'm right beside you,
Scream like you like to, your lucky that I like you,
So get what you want to,

[Repeat Hook:]

[Common:]
Whatever you want, you know that I want you,
Be my turntable, lemme spin somethin on you,
It's the good life, that I wanna loan you,
You know what it's like for you to come home to,

[Repeat Hook:]

[Kanye West:]
Now as soon as I change up,
Everybody else tryna step they game up,
Won't they, don't they, will they, nah
Still n-ggas feel Ye,
So do whatever y'all want, what's the deal aye,

[Repeat Hook:]

[Kid Cudi:]
I see them hoes over there ain't you,
And all the superficials want to trade your shoes,
I see and I remind everything they might say,
Baby girl sex good as well as the BJs,
And a n-gga can't front,

[John Legend:]
Hey girl, we gon live it up tonight,
Hey girl, welcome to the grammy life,
Hey girl, you know hows this goes, doesn't get old, centerfold, is all I know,
Whatever you want,

Whatever you want,
Lalalalalala,
Lalala la.
