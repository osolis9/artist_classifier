Your-Love-Goes-On:Priesthood
Your love goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on.
Your love is much deeper than the deep blue sea and words can't express what you mean to me.
And I love it when we spend time in secrecy cause time well spent is an eternity.
And when I do wrong Lord you help me be a man that can love so tenderly.
And praising you Lord is my symphony and my main desire is to be close to thee.
Cause you are the one who makes my eyes to see and you are the one who gives me reason to breathe.
And anyone I'm close to gets blessed through me and that's how I know you have been a friend to me.
I lift my hands towards the heavenlies and if I die now I die happily.
Cause you are the one who sets my spirit free cause greater is he that's in me.
Your love goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on.
It's the voice of the S, E double M droppin another gem, comin' thru with the blood again.
I remember when I was so ignorant, by the blood my sins became irrelevant.
The innocent instead of the guilty, the perfect in place of the filthy.
It hit me (He did it for me), all the pain and the agony (He did it for me).
Rejected and betrayed (He did it for me), buried in the grave (He did it for me).
Blood on His clothes (He did it for me), on the third day He rose (He did it for me).
As my heart beat flow where the stars be, I like to party, party, party.
And your mercy, mercy, mercy is infinite it don't stop and it don't quit.
Your love goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on, goes on and on and on.
