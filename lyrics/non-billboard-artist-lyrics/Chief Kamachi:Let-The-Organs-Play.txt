Let-The-Organs-Play:Chief Kamachi
Yeah, Kamalah
I'm back on my zone
Yeah, I'm back on my zone
Yeah, it feel good baby
It feel good baby
C'mon
Yeah

(Chorus)
Let the organs play
It's the only way
Let the organs play
It's the only way
I think I'm sane
They say psycho
They say I'm Damian
I think I'm Michael
Let the organs play
It's the only way

[Chief Kamachi]
I still spit on the mic sicker
Summon the demons in the night quicker
Blink my right eye, watch all the lights flicker
Disco ball 40 the poltergeist liquor
Street nigga experimenting with white Wicca
To the left path conjure a sign
Platinum pentagram and in the crime of kind
All my street niggas saying Chief vial is mine
The black devil worshipers swallowing swine
Do you believe that?
Body's in hell, give me feedback
Hands on the old Ouija Board and a weed sack
Witches from Salem bring me deniro
Neanderthal whores, Iceberg is their hero
Pimp cycle, little disturb if I might say
Eyes from billie goat make the curry real spicy
Kamalah, fresh blood, the flesh on the collar
Smiling, strolling out of a funeral parlor
Yeah

(Chorus)

[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, Kamachi, black candles and chainsaws
Project Lecter, big bowl full of brain slaw
Catapillar boots, pitchfork and plain shaw
St. Lucifer, we shop at the same mall
Dope, snorted out of a dead dames broad
Look in the sky, think I can make the rain fall?
Maybe I'm high? Maybe I'm lonely?
Blasphemous, did God really do something to me?
Got a debt with the angels, fuck it, just sue me
I'm in the high court, tryna get a buck from your homie
Heard the story, love every word was glory
Phantom of the Opera, playing in purgatory
She needed a chaperone, ready to ask ya holmes
Sexy, sicko, jerk with a fractured bone
Evil and extacy, that's my master zone
Pretty dead fuck, no need to cap a dome
C'mon

(Chorus)

[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, I never felt so freer
Rap of lungs taste like caesadea
One slice is nice, some mala and pizzeria's
Kill a chee gong, weed bong
