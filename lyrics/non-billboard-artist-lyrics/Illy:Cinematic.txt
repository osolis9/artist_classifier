Cinematic:Illy
Yeah, long as cameras on us hold it, let it roll
And I'll give you the greatest story I've ever told
Started green, and out of my reach
On the Bayside beaches and south-side streets
Frankston line trains I found my niche
Teenage dreams bound by speech
Native tongue I talk rap but of course fluent in the universal language of more
Testament to patience
Shattered every estimate they gave
With hat and hand never said it's greatness
Put in four or five years, that work ethics amazing
Either pay respect or be mistaken
Dudes tried startin', youse no part of it
I don't raise my voice I improve my argument
I've done it before, won't hesitate to do it again
My city, my pad, my pen

Life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
Life feels cinematic right now
And life feels cinematic right now
It's all lights, camera, action right now
And life feels cinematic right now

There's no pressure to prove none of you wrong
You the same ones judging whole careers off a couple of songs
Man my skills still tight, but skills ain't love without icing
So I slid a velvet glove over iron fist
It worked, deal with it
I'm my own meal ticket
Did it while they stayed home still (â€¦)
So fuck a death threat, my family's proud
I can't please everyone, but I can buy a house
I've been, humbled by love, toughened by hate
I've grown thick-skin, never been coloured in jade
I'm still as hungry as I ever was
We stayed steady on
Look at everyone else, where's the effort gone?
Worked magic with the mic
Since the days where the pay was a fraction of the flights
Now the proof rules, we don't buy in the hype
It's the fourth time, cue the highlights

Middle finger to the magistrate
The one that got away
Middle class white boy, stand with my back up straight
Navigated fake friends and false accolades
Swear I'll never break bread with that pack again
New day more extras and advances
Hand in hand with
More pressure, better standards
I'm well aware by expressing it with grandeur
I ask more questions than I answer
Rack your brain
Hip-hop my guardian angel
Married to the music, game to stay faithful
Never satisfied that
Where I'm at's right
Cause success ain't final
Failure ain't fatal
Fall down, straight back on the bounce
Diamond in the rough, now jewel in the crown
Might not be much but it's all I'm about
When I stop and look out at the crowd

Maybe one day you will realise what this means to me
Maybe you won't, but I know
This is me from twelve till now
My life has been put in these rhymes
For almost as long as I can remember
And this is it
The moment I'll look back on as one of my greatest highs
And all of you made this possible
I couldn't thank you if I tried
But let me try
