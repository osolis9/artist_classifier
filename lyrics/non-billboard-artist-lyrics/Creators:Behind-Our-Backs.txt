They always been there
but not in your mind
You need some special treatment to feel alright
You never call them, you never visit
You wanna be the one in need
to be the missing

You try to make friends,
with all of your gossip…

You rather talk about us behind our back
Make us feel inadequate and you don't care
You have nothing but your own stories
Of our mistakes and our troubles, your glory

You try to make friends,
with all of your gossip…
Oh no!

Interlude

There're people hurt
but you will never change
Try to flirt with the thin line that calls hate
Now what's the problem?
It's not your strife
So keep on playing the victim in your life

You try to make friends,
with all of your gossip…

People talking

People talking
Oh behind our backs
People talking
Oh, people talking
People talking
Oh, behind our backs
People talking
Oh, people talking!
People talking
Behind our backs
People talking
Oh, people talking!
People talking, oh
Behind our back!
