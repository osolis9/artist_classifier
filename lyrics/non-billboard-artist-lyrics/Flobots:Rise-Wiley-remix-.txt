So much pain
We don? t know how to be but angry
Feel infected like we? ve got gangrene
Please don? t let anybody try to change me

Me, just me, in the middle of a sea full of faces
Full of faces, some laugh, some salivate
What? s in your alleyway
Recycling bins or bullet cases?

It? s not equal, it? s not fair
We? re different people but we're not scared
We ain? t never scared to pave a new path
Make a new street, build a new

Say, can you see by the dawns early light?
Free slaves running, songs words weren? t right
Now, a new days coming
The few stay stunning while the many are handsome
Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom

The bass drumming is the anthem
We step to the heartbeats
Of our granddaughters and grandsons
And

Rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise

Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise

Lost hope and found need
Grounded by our surroundings
Did the walls scream, universities
Or you and I the tees?

React, automatic and we burst when squeezed
And make 9-11 each emergency
Urgency, amber to red like the turning leaves
Oh please, let the hurting cease

Don? t let apathy police the populace
We will march across
Those stereotypes that were marked for us
The answer's obvious, we switch the consonants
And change the sword to words and lift continents

Rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise

Rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
Together we rise, together we rise
