I-20 meet the dealer 'cuz I'm out on bail
I broke free and I ain't never goin' back to jail
ATL's Eastside says I'm back from Hell
Reintroduced to my connect and I got sacks to sell

Since I was young I broke bones usin' sticks and stones
Puttin' bruises on you losers, lames leave me alone
I'll be servin' it for certain 'til the day that I die
You got that reggie for the low I got that fire for the high

Niggaz travelin' when they rappin' but I feel like they actin'
And I ain't talkin' 'bout vacation if I say that I'm packin'
Hear that hunger in my voice and all the pain in my eyes
If this the only chance I get, then you can bet I'mma ride

I got my back against the wall but my hand on my tool
'Cuz niggaz gotta give me somethin' I got nothin' to lose
A Town's new ruler throw ya side in the sky
Y'all niggaz lovin' how y'all livin' but I'm ready to die

Hey, I'm a maniac
Go and tell the whole world Mr. Pain is back
So get them thangs out, you betta lock up ya house
And tell the cops they let the animals out

You niggaz settin' up to get me better come wit that four
This 20 got magazines and I ain't talkin' The Source
Mr. Pain'll change the game by the time I'mma reign
I catch a charge like a flagrant foul deep in the lane

Y'all niggaz know where y'all can find me see I'm deep in the South
Where niggaz put away they Benz and pull they Chevrolet out
Y'all niggaz cakin' on these broads spend a stack on that bitch
I'll throw that ho right out the VIP and throw some yak on that bitch

And as far as all this beefin' y'all ain't worryin' me
Read the index so I'm body that's a story in me
If I say it then I mean it you can take it at that
Y'all been eatin' off these streets and now I'm takin' it back

Y'all won't see me sideways you get it live and direct
I-20 in the flesh I'm comin' live from the Dec
DTP I represent it see I'm more than a star
And if I'm fuckin' witcha club I'm buyin' more than the bar

Hey, I'm a maniac
Go and tell the whole world Mr. Pain is back
So get them thangs out, you betta lock up ya house
And tell the cops they let the animals out
Break bread nigga

I-20 is the shorts that you still takin' aim
I'm the blocks head coach bitch I'm teachin' the game
So I'm servin' like I'm Agassi, Venus or Serena
I'm ridin' wit a felony you duckin' misdemeanors

And man I'm still hurtin' and my mama's still workin'
So I stay wit the glove and a mask like a servant
A Town's new ruler throw ya side in the sky
Y'all niggaz lovin' how y'all livin' and I'm ready to die

Hey, I'm a maniac
Go and tell the whole world Mr. Pain is back
So get them thangs out, you betta lock up ya house
And tell the cops they let the animals out
