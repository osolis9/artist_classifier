[Intro: Priscilla Shirer]
You are already positioned in a place of victory in your life
You're just going to claim what God has already given you
Do you remember when the Children of Israel
Went into The Promised Land in Joshua, chapter one
God is confirming His calling of Joshua
He's saying to him, 'You be strong and courageous
When you march into the land'
And then He said to him, 'Every place you put your feet
You will have access to
I have already given the Promised Land to you
The whole of it already belongs to you
But you only get to enjoy as much as you put your feet on'

[Verse: JustPierre]
Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus, still the same thang
Full of grace and truth and He can't change
Faith in the cross freed us from the chain gang
So if I plead the blood, I don't gangbang
Me and my great danes rolling like a freight train
Consecrated, prayed up, trying to maintain
Slingshot, five stones, that's my thang-thang
Slingshot, five stones, that's my thang-thang
Bang bang! I'm aiming for the devil's head
The Word of God sharper than a double-edge
Sword, grab the weapon and we waging war
On any devil that defy the army of the LORD
It's cuz of Him my debts were paid
Took the keys of death, hell, and the grave
Uhh, the enemy trying to regulate
But he gone have to flee seven ways
March around the city for seven days
With a shout, Jericho walls decimate
So, I don't trip if things escalate
In fact I'ma give God extra praise
March around the city for seven days
With a shout, Jericho walls decimate
So, I don't trip if things escalate
In fact I'ma give God extra praise, Yeah

[Chorus:]
P-a-a-aradise
P-a-a-aradise, yeah
P-a-a-aradise
P-a-a-aradise, oh
{repeat}
