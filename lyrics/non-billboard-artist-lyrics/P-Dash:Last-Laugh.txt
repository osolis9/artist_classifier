Last-Laugh:P-Dash
Okay let me breakdown lingustics the pen in my hand is majestic/
Like statuistic timetables/
I have the last Laugh on your mechincial movements/
Im full blown Aids on this mic/while your common cold blue chips/these promoters make me sick /they getting beat with a pool stick /watch saliva and blood/go down my lips/stress im breaking barriers/and to sick/with techinque and skills/and like eazy stay ruthless/where the untangable force you cant move quick/
Im on my green like coutons/like its ramadan/flow like water so my middle name is avaian
