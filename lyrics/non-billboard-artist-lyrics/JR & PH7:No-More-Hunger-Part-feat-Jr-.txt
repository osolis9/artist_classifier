No-More-Hunger-Part-feat-Jr-:JR & PH7
Oh yeah …Khuli Chana … what
It's all about the… for the money
No more hunger… No more hunger
Things we do …things things we do
Things we do … things things we do

Get off the wall for my party a re tlohele bo snax
Diwa like Fidelity trucks
Ba re ka thebe man bitsa madam
Madam bitsa man he can drink whatever he wants
Let's toast to kgora kgobola mokotla
Now you are proud hlokomela di scout
Jealousy ke bolwetse bolakaletsi is the same thing
Like pimping the system I'm telling you son
No more hunger…

X2
No more hunger… it's all about the
Things we do… things things we do for the zaka
No more hunger… it's all about the
Things we do… things things we do for the zaka

I told you about the things we do for leshampa
The things we do for diranta… the things we do… do
But I represent the bull's eye ka letanta
I make dough make no room for blunder
We aint getting no younger we staying under
You don't know go shampa ke ya tampa tampa
Ke pete ke ya pele from now Maf-town to Ratanda
Let's go…

I be hier so ge se wa nkolota
Better have my money timer mochana
Tito Mboweni… ke ya sokola
Even though I got a hit mo moweng
Hip hop in it o tlo kolopa
Flows make chicks di apole (di apole)
O tlo koropa…ke gana go sokola
Fokofa…

No more tlala more mashala
Just ka sala wena wa qava tse ke tsaka
Tlala if ka slumber prick e kare cucumber
Jealousy is tearing you asunder … apart
Come on tlala ke e tshwere ka upper cut
Towdee Mac JR le Khuli Chana
Is just re tshwere ke tlala
To this game ke stampa nama nzomela papa
Furulutse molomo…

X 2
Somebody gotta make this chedda boss
Nobody should loose themselves for for this smega boss
He keya o chayela boss… keya o botsa boss
He keya o chayela boss
He keya o chayela boss… keya o botsa boss
He keya o chayela boss… he keya o chayela boss

Man make the nyuku … nyuku don't make a man
Nyuku e tlisa bana ba… nyuku don't make a man
Nyuku e reka jwala… nyuku don't make a man
See make the nyuku… nyuku don't make a man
Understand ha… ah … nyuku don't make a man
Nyuku e ka o bayela kara… nyuku don't make a man
Nyuku e ka o bayela kara… nyuku don't make a man
See man the nyuku… nyuka don't make a man
Understand…

You gotta get up for the zaka
Get down for the zaka
Get it on for the zaka
Get around for the zaka
Come on…
