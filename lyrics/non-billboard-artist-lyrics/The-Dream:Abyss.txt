Abyss:The-Dream
'Cause it's you, 'cause of you
Even though I said we're through
It's all because of you, Nikki

She told me she would always be there
And I believed her, believed her
This girl was no good for me
She had so many secrets, secrets, yeah

Even though she wasn't my main girl
I'm still committed, it was me and you
You said you wouldn't tell
But you saved my voicemails
But I always knew

So now cry 'till you drown your face
And bitch, I give a damn how harsh this may seem
I'm here to put your heart in its place
Chained up in the bottom of the lake

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)

I was the innocent bystander
She had etiquette, she had good manners
Pretty little thing, great little body
Never in magazines, never at after parties

And I could sense it then, but it didn't matter
As long as me and you were together
Thought it was better than that
I'll never let you back to me
Tell your boy at Us Weekly
I sent your photos to TMZ

Now cry 'till you drown your face
And bitch, I could give a damn how harsh this may seem
But I'm here to put your heart in its place
Chained up at the bottom of the lake

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)

Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall
(Abyss, abyss)
Now let the waterfall

If only the sun would come
And dry the water away
But you're in the abyss, my lady
And you won't see another day

Now cry till you drown your face
And bitch, I could give a damn how harsh this may seem
But I'm here to put your heart in its place
Chained up at the bottom of the lake

Now let the water fall
(If only the sun would come and)
Water fall
(Dry the water away)

Now let the water fall
(But you're in the abyss, my lady)
Now let the water fall
(And you won't see another day)

Now let the water fall
(If only the sun would come and)
Now let the water fall
(Dry the water away)

Now let the water fall
(But you're in the abyss, my lady)
Now let the water fall
(And you won't see another day)

Now let the water fall
(If only the sun would come and)
Now let the water fall
(Dry the water away)

Now let the water fall
(But you're in the abyss, my lady)
The water fall
(And you won't see another day)

If only the sun would come
And dry the water away
But you're in the abyss, my lady
And you won't see another day
