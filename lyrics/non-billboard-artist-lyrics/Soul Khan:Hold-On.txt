Hold-On:Soul Khan
Did I did I stutter when I declared war?
If my skin doesn't fit in could I just wear yours?
Messiah flier than an entire air force
Whether wings or ones, whatever you care for
Your flow patterns are cro-magnon, you slow bastard
I close casketed those that tried to close caption
The gold standard of growth your homie soul mastered
You up the creek with no paddle and trying to row backwards
I've been wishing I could tylenol the pain
A lot of you ain't followed through after obama fought for change
Yeah, I got soul, that's why I got it in my name
I can stand on hot coals, y'all just wacka flocka flame
See I ain't really built for your sensitive ears
I've really ended careers, so if the message ain't clear
I am here for good so get used to me
Or the next record you hear'll be your eulogy
Now I don't suppose you
Think I ain't know you
Been watching my every step (hold on)
I could still kill you in one breath (hold on)
Ain't no party like a soul khan party
Wait, soul khan parties, eh, no not hardly
Got nothing to say to them blowjob barbies
And cats that puff lah and think they know bob marley
They blunt smokin, I'm blunt spoken I'm done joking
You scooby doo ass muhfuckas is ruh-ro-ing
As I become shogun I'm cut-throat as it gets
Until PYT approach for love potion
Like what's that commotion? that's her come motion
She convulsing just off the way my tongue rollin
Fun's over, I was sickly and anemic
But now when I am preachin, the
gideons
She's willing to receive it, the ceiling where her feet hit
I'm chilling with a mean chick like dylan at the peach pit
I've been raw since prince paul was stetsasonic
So piss off, or get pissed on like reaganomics
So keep all your cosigns
And keys to the goldmine
The people are on my side (hold on)
And I will move heaven
And earth to protect them
So you ain't gon leave this alive (hold on)
