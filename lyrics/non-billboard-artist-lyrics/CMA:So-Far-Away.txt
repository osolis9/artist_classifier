So-Far-Away:CMA
Sometimes everything feels so far away
No matter what happens I will stay
With you, waiting for a better day
Take my hand and it will be ok
Sometimes everything feels so far away
No matter what happens I will okay
With you, waiting for a better day...
Take my hand and let's go away
Let's go away
So far away
So far away
Let's go away
Let's go away
So far away
So far away
Let's go away...
