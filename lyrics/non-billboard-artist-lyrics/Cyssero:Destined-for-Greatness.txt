Destined-for-Greatness:Cyssero
I'm moving toward, things I don't see,
For I'm determined to get what God promised me.
I make changes in the company I keep,
No more distractions to stop me.
I'm destined for Greatness
Now I'm on my way

Now I'm on my way

Before I was formed in the womb God knew me
He sanctified me then and affirmed me.
Now I have favor on my life to sustain me.
