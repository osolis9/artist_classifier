Tangerine-Speedo:Caviar
Two-week vacation, Costa Rica see America
Young ladies, oh, eureka! So many there to score-ica
Cruise the ocean bars with some similar type fellows
Little Latin lovelies drinking gin and Mello Yellos

Please get me a towel
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
You're all over town
In tangerine
La la la la la la la la

Nowhere to go, nothing to do
I'll be as gentle on you as tearless baby shampoo
Back to my bungalow with flesh tone kimonos
Ah, come a little closer feel the 'Sting' of my 'Bono'
No no no no

The talk of the town
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
How you get around
In your tangerine?
La la la la la la la la

Little Latin lovelies will love to drink gin
And Mello Yello in my bungalow
Lovin' me, tangerine
La la la la la la la la

All the French girls go
"Zut alors, no no no no, zut alors, no no"
Coming at the target
You're as straight as Magellan
If you've got a secret weapon
Well, you're as sure as hell ain't telling

'Cause your mouth made an offer
That the bodies cannot veto
No woman can resist a man
Who looks good in a Speedo

Fuckin' get me a towel
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
You're all over town
Tangerine
La la la la la la la la

Talk of the town
Mr. Tangerine Speedo
How you get around
In your tangerine?
La la la la la la la la

Little Latin lovelies will love to drink gin
And Mello Yello in my bungalow

Zut alors, no, zut alors, no no
Zut alors, no no no no no
Zut alors, no, zut alors, no no
Zut alors, no no no no no

Zut alors, no, zut alors, no no
Zut alors, no no no no no
Zut alors, no, zut alors, no no
Zut alors, no no no no no
