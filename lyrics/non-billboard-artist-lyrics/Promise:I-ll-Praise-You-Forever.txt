I-ll-Praise-You-Forever:Promise
People don't know
Cause they don't try
When love unfolds
You gotta hold it tight
I see your soul
In tune with mine
I want you close
I'm more than willing to devote my life

I promise you forever
It's all I have to give
I promise you together
Is the only way we'll live
I promise you myself with no limitations
Babe everything you need I'll provide
I'm laying it on the line
I promise you forever

I'll carry the weight
Away from you
I'll take the pain
If you need me to
You have my shoulder
And my heart is yours
As we get older
You'll never hear me say
That I'm not sure

I promise you forever
It's all I have to give
I promise you together
Is the only way we'll live
I promise you myself with no limitations
Babe everything you need I'll provide
I'm laying it on the line
I promise you that

We'll see the world together
Side by side, there's nothing better
You don't have to put away your dreams
You'll see (You'll see)
You are mine, without a doubt
Babe you'll forever be my queen
Oh leave it to me
Promise you forever
It's all I have to give
Oh Yeaaah

I promise you forever
It's all I have to give
I promise you together
Is the only way we'll live
I promise you myself with no limitations
Babe everything you need I'll provide
I'm laying it on the line
I said I promise you forever
I said I
