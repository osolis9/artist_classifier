No Scrubs (Remix)
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster (busta, busta...)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So (no)

I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time and (no)

[Chorus:]
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

There's a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
Cuz I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass
So (no) (yea, yea)

I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time (no)

[Chorus]

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son I'm talking to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
Oh yes son I'm talking to you (baby)
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son I'm talking to you (yea yea yea yea...)
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no I don't want no (oh)

No scrub (no scrub, no love)
No scrub (no no) (no scrub, no love)
No scrub (no no no no no)
No scrub (no no)
No

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Left Eye:]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizon
Then that leaves you in a class with scrubs never risin'
I don't find it surprisin'
If you don't have the g's
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you somethin' to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screen
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular
And then I get back to ya
With diamond like precision
Insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition
From your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho
Not really, T-Boz and all my senoritas
Is steppin' on your Filas
But you don't hear me though

[Chorus]
