mama had a baby
Six.. six.. six in the morning
and i'm taking a nap
In the back of the car
waiting for the stars to snap. 
The stars on my cap
remind me of the time
we went to Fargo
with a car full of anxiety.
An angel's breast, and a tank top
she stared at my heart
she's trying to make it stop
and if i havent leearned nothin 
then i've learned a lot
momma had a baby and its head popped off.
Give it up, turn it lose
fokr the sake of life
if i knew now what i knew then 
i'd make her my wife. 
I've been chasing these mic's for too long
debating with god 
about who's right and who's wrong
got a new song to sing
a little happier.
hurting
that i didn't learn the words
until after the matter
is a matter of fact
i doubt that i'll ever even try to work it 
to having her back.
used to skip classes, 
now i skip breakfast 
never skip practice
and i need to flip the mattress
to help me forget
the kiss, the lips, the soft

momma had a baby and its head popped off, 
we did all we could to try and reattach it.
i couldn't do it so i picked it up and threw it
off the building
just to see if all the children were quick enough to catch it.

So i'll tear down these walls
let the chips fall
let's all go outside and play a game of kickball
laugh a little 
and live a lot
she squeals and giggles when i hit that spot
if you give me a minute
and i can finish my beer
i'll move a tad bit closer to the limits of hear
and when it gets clear
and the sun comes back
we can drive too fast 
we can fly off the tracks

tuck in your shirt 
hike up your skirt
welcome to the jungle where the tigers give birth
i only took my time because she looked so fine
and it makes me crazy
trying to pay them no mind
you should save your spine 
and stay on the struggle 
shoot the trouble
and keep the temper subtle

My rent just doubled
because they took my roommate
and i'm keepin these movies
because they all past the due date

Close, cover before the striking
lick a missile at the bird, 
try to cripple its right wing
and i end every sentence with a dot dot dot

say outloud, we must network
should have been more specific
now have this daily pressure
some of them just dont get it
leave me at the beginning
start over and do it well
shut my trap, stop complaining 
stay sober and step on shells

my oh my, 
yours oh yours
and when it snows, it pours
and when i'm running out of fire,
i just open the doors
and go sit on the porch
and watch the neighborhood wars

But the sun I've got
and i've got my son
and i've got my will to run
until I'm dead and done
and this is for the love we've found 
and the love we've lost,
