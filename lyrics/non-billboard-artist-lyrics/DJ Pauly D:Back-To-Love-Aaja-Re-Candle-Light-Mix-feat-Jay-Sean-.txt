Back-To-Love-Aaja-Re-Candle-Light-Mix-feat-Jay-Sean-:DJ Pauly D
Can you feel it?
All that space in between us.
I know you can feel it,
I miss you just a little too much.
Memories in the breeze are they gone now?
Thought that I would be right but I'm wrong now.
So many feelings,
I miss you just a little too much.
We built it up,
Then let it all crash down.
We had it all,
But let it burn to the ground.
But maybe we can turn around and get back
Cause right now I'm off track
I'm looking for a way back to love
I need you now
I'm feeling for your touch
Come back to love
Come back to love.
Dekho na tera sath khawabo mein paya
Jaanu na fhir thaam le mera hath
Saanson ki khushboo kho gayi hai
Kya hua meri bhool hui hai
Dil pukaare mere sath aaja re
Woh khawab tha jaane kiyu.
Toota
Bus ek pal mein jahan kho geya
Can you see itor did everything we were turned into dust.
Do you believe it?
Can we ever get back to us?
Memories in the breeze are they gone now?
Thought that I would be right but I'm wrong now.
So many feelings,
I miss you just a little too much
We built it up,
Then let it all crash down.
We had it all,
But let it burn to the ground.
But maybe we can turn around and get back
Cause right now I'm off track
I'm looking for a way back to love
I need you now
I'm feeling for your touch
Come back to love
Come back to love
Come back to love
We built it up,
Then let it all crash down.
We had it all,
But let it burn to the ground.
But maybe we turn around and get back
Cause right now I'm off track
I'm looking for a way back to love
I need you now
I'm feeling for your touch
Come back to love.
