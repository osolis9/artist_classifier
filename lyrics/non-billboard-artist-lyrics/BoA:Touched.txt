Touched:BoA
Saw you standing in the dark
And I like your energy
I'm feeling you way from afar
Boy, you're distracting me

My heart is racing, body's aching
And I'm shaking all because of you
It's something about you

Now I'm thinking 'bout who you with
'Cause you got me curious
If you don't come closer I'ma have a fit
Tell me boy what you thinking too
Gotta know if you feel the same way I do
Talk to me

I can be your lady, if you be my baby
So don't keep me waiting
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched

'Cause I've got this problem, only you can solve it
But you gotta come to me
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched

I wanna be touched, wanna be touched, touched
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched, touched

Ya gotta get to know me first and we can take it further
And I can't help but flirt 'cause I'd be crazy
If I let you leave without your number
Boy don't make me wait too long for you
I just wanna get to know you

Now I'm thinking 'bout who you with
'Cause you got me curious
If you don't come closer I'ma have a fit
Tell me boy what you thinking too
Gotta know if you feel the same way I do
Talk to me

I can be your lady, if you be my baby
So don't keep me waiting
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched

'Cause I've got this problem, only you can solve it
But you gotta come to me
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched

I never believed in love at first sight
But you made me wanna give it a try
You won't regret it, boy if you let me in

I can be your lady, if you be my baby
So don't keep me waiting
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched

'Cause I've got this problem, only you can solve it
But you gotta come to me
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched
