Tell-Me-Easter-s-on-Friday-Remaster-Single-Edit-:The Associates
Shrinking like a pygmy
Flinching like a warrior
Passive from prediction
Confirming of a somebody you

Ask him for an invite
He'll fix an invitation
I want someone to steal from
Anyone but probably you

Tell me Easter's on Friday
And I'll splint my hips
Tell me Easter's on Friday
And I'll bruise my lips
And if I must be frank well I must be tone deaf
Tell me Easter's adjourned
Tell me why, when and where
Tell me Easter's adjourned
I'll meet you half way there
I'll meet you

Be a dignitary
Call me by my surname
Isn't it inconsiderate
Could it be or should it be felt?

If I see you angry
It makes me want to kiss you
Massive contradiction
Confirming of a somebody you

Tell me Easter's on Friday
And I'll splint my hips
Tell me Easter's on Friday
And I'll bruise my lips
And if i must be frank well I must be tone deaf
Tell me Easter's adjourned
Tell me why when and where
Tell me Easter's adjourned
I'll meet you half way there
I'll meet you
I'll meet you

If I see you angry
It makes me want to kiss you
Massive contradiction
Confirming all that's somebody you

Tell me Easter's on Friday
And I'll splint my hips
Tell me Easter's on Friday
And I'll bruise my lips
And if i must be frank well I must be tone deaf
Tell me Easter's a drag adjourned
Tell me why, when and where
