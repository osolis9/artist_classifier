Secrecy:Prime Time
I'm street live wrapped in paradise
I'm the fatal sin
Truth is what I feel I've got a life to steal
Have to crawl inside your mind

I've got your brothers smile looking eye to eye
Knowing what you see
Life for sale, indeed
Worth a dime, for I wash my sins in greed

Secrecy

The government and I working overtime
Join the line I'm in
Silent blow the wind, got it's eye on you
Hearing everything

Secrecy

'Live it over'
I'm the echo of the call
I'm the brick that breaks your fall
Live a life of secrecy
Wounded, bleeding on the run
I'm the wolf that hunts you down
Live a life of secrecy

[solo]

Live your life..
