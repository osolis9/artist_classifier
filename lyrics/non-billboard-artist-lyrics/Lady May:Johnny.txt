Johnny:Lady May
johnny had no choice but to leave his home to go find a job somewhere far in town
just to maintain his family on the far
he left in the morning before sunrise
with only a jug of water he hiked
hiked to the nearest rural town

As he came there
everything was so new to him
he stopped and stared
wishing his mummy was with him
so lonely and hungry he is right now
such a stranger he is in this great big town
(no food
no clothes
no shelter he's all alone
nobody to hold him close protecting him from the winters cold) ×2

(johnny wants to go
johny wants to go home)×4

johnny searched everywhere for help
he can barely feed himself
day in day out he struggled to even shelter himself
like a man he stays strong believes that one day he'll have it all
a vision comes through of his home
it encourages him to work extra hard
press press on johnny
if you try harder you will succeed
press press on johnny
if you try harder you will succeed

no food
no clothes
no shelter he's so alone
nobody to hold him close
protecting him from the winters cold

(johnny wants to go
