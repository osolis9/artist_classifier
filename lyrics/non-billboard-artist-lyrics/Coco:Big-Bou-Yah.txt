Yo I put in the work now everything's gwanin'
All from speaking my mind and barring
My names coco your names jarring
No see me biggin' up the game since morning
Real life is a movie that I star in
Based on a true story you can't par him
Might see me at a stage show with Toddla
2 Sheffield veterans what a bargain
I write sick bars on a mental one
They be like where'd you get your pencil from

Nah rudeboi I can't say too much cos I know you teef like a dental don

Man come against and fail but still try ting on an experimental one

You got whips and chains on floss but I don't mean shit if it's a rental one
I put in the work now everything's easy
All from speaking my mind like weezy
You look wasted I look steezy
Subblow to your forehead that's greazy
I was in Mosside with a few dons and we shutdown the Redbull stage completely
I said it's 5 in the morning still awake now baginal people wanna meet me

She said I was big-headed and cheeky when I said that I do this uniquely

Told everybody when no one believed me
That I was taking over indiscreetly

I work hard and I grind on a weekly

So I can't let these wasteman defeat me
You was anybody getting daggered on a regular
Now you wanna chat about fleeky wedis
You might hear me on a radio station
Heavy rotation
Heavyweight I ain't gotta seek validation
This year 'imma live and see 'nuff spots like a 101 dalmatians
You wanna have a serious conversation but when it's business I see pure animation
Started in oh four now it's fifteen and you been a little man through the old Joe
ration
Punching up weight yeah that's you
Me I'm doin' what I said I'm gonna do
Step on a scale I'm heavy like a whole crew
They be clocking me properly yeah they cannot walk through
I walk In I get clocked
You talk shit and get boxed
Big up If you're with me and Bare gunshots to anyone that don't rate coco pops
