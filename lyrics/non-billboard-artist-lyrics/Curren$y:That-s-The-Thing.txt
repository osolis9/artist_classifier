That-s-The-Thing:Curren$y
I keep on comin' back oh back to you
Baby uh, I keep on comin' back

[Verse 1:]
From day one they down to ride
Every second since then they're by my side
Broken hearted from the last, often she cried
But holdin' on to love for dear life
Before everything was good, we had a great time
But fall out over something, a few months down the line
See clearly love is blind cuz we can't see a way out this
No, reach a compromise, honestly I'm not tryin'
Cuz I wanna be with you but they callin' me outside and I'm like
How can a man choose? I wish you'd understand
If they're mother wasn't you I'd really just be playin'
Might splash up and be through but my heart's still in your hand
And I promise that's the truth and I hear what you be sayin'
And I feel your point of view but somehow I forgive that shit they taught
Up in loot
Late night speedin', I'm close
I respect it if you left me but I'm glad you never do

[Hook:]
See here's the thing
I won't sit here broken hearted
Boy, we gon get back where we started
'Cause I won't need you, no
I gained too much to lose

I've already bothered you
And there's nothing left but just us two
You're everything (you're everything)
See that's the thing (see that's the thing)
Yea, that's the thing

[Verse 2:]
And I'll fall asleep next to none of them hoes
No matter what's poppin', I'll be sure to make it home
There's no excuse for wilin', I'm just makin' sure it's known
And I'm actually not doin' half of what I could be doin'
I'm slowin' down, tryna make improvements
Thinkin' 'bout the future and shit that
What cohesive union, raise a little princess, a junior
Soon as I make enough with this music cuz you've got my attention
I'll be patient as I pursue it
It would been the best for both us if you'd just sit through it
When it's all said and done we would have everything, a beauty
And sail into the setting sun, but I already know
That you done her a visit like a thousand times before
And I done promise it like many times more
But I've been sincere, I see us winnin' and we almost there

(Hook)

I've already bothered you
And there's nothing left but just us two
You're everything (you're everything)
See that's the thing (see that's the thing)
Yea, that's the thing

(Bridge)
You wanna go with me and we connect
Now we're supposed to be
I'm all yours, all yours, all day
And I could fix
I'm gonna walk you out
Cuz I proved out
So I tough it out
So I'm all yours, all yours, all day

(Hook)
See here's the thing
I won't sit here broken hearted
Boy, we gon get back where we started
'Cause I won't need you, no
I gained too much to lose

I've already bothered you
And there's nothing left but just us two
You're everything (you're everything)
See that's the thing (see that's the thing)
Yea, that's the thing

I said I love you
That's the thing
I won't allow you
See that's the thing
You know I love you
See that's the thing
