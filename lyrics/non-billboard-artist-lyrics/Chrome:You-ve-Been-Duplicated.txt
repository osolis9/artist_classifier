You-ve-Been-Duplicated:Chrome
I saw you
turning up the stairs
It's been years
since you've been here
The things are still gone but things aren't the same
There's no chance that you've been tranced
You've been complicated
You've been rather duplicated

You've been complicated
You've been duplicated
You've been recreated
You've been... replaced

Go downtown cause I've lost count
Now your eyes changed but your still the same
Oh no Oh no

You've been complicated
You've been duplicated
You've been resignated
You've been...
rather been replaced
replaced...
