I-Need-You:Jovanotti
Hey you honeydew I can not sleep i don' t know what to do I'm lookin' for a girl to spend the night Makin' dirty things 'till the early light And when you wake up in the morning and you see i'm gone Check this out cause you're not alone I love you i'm waiting like a dynamite Baby come to me cause i need you tonight I need you tonight i want you tonight I love you i want you i need you tonight Hey love how do you feel When i talk to you i really feel so real Cause your voice is a special sound So please my honey please come around Right down the club when i saw you last night Your eyes were brown but they were shining bright You asked me that song i told you yes I think i'm in love baby i must confess I need you tonight... Well baby you are so sweet You make me dance like a special beat I wanna dance with you i wanna make it right I wanna do it all day and do! it all night Yes i know you're a child but i'm a child too Take a ride baby i think i need you Yes i know you're a child but i'm a young boy too Let's take a ride baby i think i need you I need you tonight... Hey you what you gonna do You're always on the phone but you're not alone I got you your mother Your sister and your brother Got the bills to pay gettin' bigger everyday You are a son of a gun with no income Just girls in your brain you're driving me insane I can't take no more of all these chores Cause the telephone i'm workin' for Hallo! Hey you what are you doing now Did you listen to me on the radio today OK I've dedicated you a song baby Bye bye
