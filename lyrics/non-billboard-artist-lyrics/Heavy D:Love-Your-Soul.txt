Love-Your-Soul:Heavy D
It ain't ya Gucci suits
It ain't ya Fendi boots
It ain't ya Armani, ya 'tire, who ya hired or fired
We know you that boss chick
with the, on and off switch-a
The same mami everybody on the block desire
You sip the finest shipments
You whip the finest whips and
Body look like a cryptic, they don't see it so they ig'nant
Makes me sort of indignant
Can't wait to get you pregnant
Ma you so bad, these other chicks feel nothing but resentment
And I so appreciate ya
Understand why they hate ya
My love so deep, I'll never sleep, I'll never negate ya

[Chorus]
And in case you didn't know-ooh-whoooa
(I love, love, love, love, love, love, love your soul)
And in case you didn't know-ooh-whoooa
(I love, love, love, love, girl I love your soul)
Love your soooooul, I love your sooooul
I-iiii, girl I love your soul

Hey yo ma, you so Oprah widdit
Head to toe, tailor-fitted
9 to 5, single mom
Coproate gain sister widdit
Look at Miss Independent
So focused, so relentless
So in love, non-pretentious
So hovers above the rest and
So first-class, so coach seat
So as long as you arrive on time to see me
You so in, my next-to-kin be like, "Yo, she's a win"
So all I focus on is when I'm gon' see you again

[Chorus]
