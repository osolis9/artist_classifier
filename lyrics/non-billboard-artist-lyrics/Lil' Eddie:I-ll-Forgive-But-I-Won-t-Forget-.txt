I-ll-Forgive-But-I-Won-t-Forget-:Lil' Eddie
Whatever did I do
 To deserve this pain
 I tried hard to love you
 But still made you think

 Why did you treat me so different
 You can't deny what I've said
 Cause if you took time to listen
 That why do I feel this way

 I forgive but I won't forget about
 All the things that you've done to me
 And one day soon you'll regret you lost but now
 It's too late for apologies

 Don't get me wrong I'm through and fine
 I'm okay just wanna let you know
 We've gotten closer since you left
 By the way you're missing out on so much

 How could you not spare mom's feelings
 She stood by you through thick and thin
 It's gonna take time for healing
 Don't worry mom cause I'm your friend

 I forgive but I won't forget about
 All the things that you've done to me
 And one day soon you'll regret you lost but now
 It's too late for apologies

 The stormy weather
 Is getting better
