Verse 1 - Mackin
I'm on it till I'm on it so quick call me Sonic
Do it Geordie Shore style on a car bonnet (bonnet)
Lamborgini like I want it
Want it with my name engraved on it
All the ladies saying Mackin stop it
Little doody no I haven't got my wallet
Have a look in my motherfucking pocket
I haven't lost my BB I'm gonna have to lock it
You're not a number two, only a number one
One Jaberbomb wow look it's all gone
Gone like my money, 60 pound now none
What the fuck fam where did I go wrong?
Want a good night why not come along?
Long way to go but you gotta stay strong
Strong like an ox
Big mans a rox

Verse 2 - Compound

Yeah
I walk in the party and I take a look around
Staring at your body move to the sound
Look at your face and I see you have a frown
Heading to conversate you've been let down
Imbound with a drink and you whisper compound
Stunned but I know you're here for the rebound
Straight to the point no sitting down
Grab my hand, I'm unsure where we're going
It don't matter when that smile is glowing
Back to the crib and I think I'm in love
I know you're bad but I can't get rid of
Impossibility springs to mind
Can't turn away cause I'm so damn inclined
Thinking you're here, just cause I'm signed
But I swear that bodies got me blind
Taking this to the next level can ya grasp it?

Verse 3 - Mackin

Walk in the club, have a bit of flanter
It's like flirting with a bit of banter
She's so sweet I just call her fanter
I want to be favourite rapper
No man look it's all gonna shatter
I'm glad that I've actually met her
By my addiction, just like jager
Compound, say something brother

Verse 3 - Compound

Your best friends told me when you slept around
So yeah I guess I'm looking for that rebound
I thought your love was always coming imbound
I'm done now go for the fucking exbound
People know who I am when they scream compound
So take a look right before your eyes
You can go brag that you were mine once
Only a matter of time before they come around
