The-Heaviest-Cross:YC The Cynic
I put out a song today
It got both love and hate
I only put my heart into it
My pulse got made into drum and bass
I'm only expanding the human brain
I only brought love to the human race
I only brought joy to the underpaid
Your website rating was under 8
Well fuck the numbers, I want reactions
Ive fought the power, I'm multi-facet
A trip to the Grammys they calling me classic. I ordered my suit in an orderly fashion
It took two years to create my shit
And you just sit back and rate my shit
You only get love when you hate my shit
And this is the thanks I get? Damn

We all got a got damn cross to bear
Moms had 3 kids to raise
And still went and got her masters
2 jobs so the rent was paid. And I quit school tryna be a rapper
Underground slave tryna keep his masters
Momma dead prayed tryna make it happen
And I can't say I don't believe it that
But I will say that I worked my ass off
Waited for the day I could take the backdoor
Never had the key had to break the latch off
Ducking the federali attacks with a bat in a backpack if they unattach attack dogs
Very last steps of a fallen man
A&Rs; giving me the song and dance
How I'm gone tell mom dukes I failed
Shit I might be her only hope
Damn

We all got a got damn cross to near
Young nigga done did the research. You ain't even know
You just bought a new Che Guevara t-shirt. At least it ain't Ambercrombie
My ace boon coon organized the rally
U ain't even going. Damn
I went with the shepherd to walk the valley
My guardian gone like orphan Annie
I guess I'll fight for your child's equality, higher salary, dying economy
Cynic so nice what a bright anomaly. Threw a fist up tryna fight the cavalry
Damn
Who'll be the sacrifice in 3 days come back to life a new savior and king in his afterlife, accept fate do the same damn thing and sleep fast at night?
Well

We all got a got damn cross to bear
