:
Lights out!
You're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth
Who the fuck are you now?
Lights out!
Can you feel it now?
We're calling you out
Who the fuck are you now?

:
Lifestyles of the young and the reckless
Checked in the real world
And don't ask questions
Dodging those bullets like a fucked up western
Drag you on a road till you're choked out senseless
Kings are crowned
We're the best around
Got an underground army,
Yeah we holding it down
We built our base and what we found
It takes blood and sweat
And always moving a crowd
No skill when you going the fast way
Let me see you dance one from the AK
Bullshit, now he's coughing names
Who you know, what you do
It all sounds the same
A piece of advice,
Quit dropping mine
You'll be gone way before it even is your time
Like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage
You'll be gone like a dollar bill hitting the stage

:
Lights out!
You're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth
Who the fuck are you now?
Lights out!
Can you feel it now?
We're calling you out
Who the fuck are you now?

:
I'm a light your ass up
Cause you ain't got what it takes
Your crew's riding my nuts
They'll tell you how my dick tastes
Yeah, I'm shitfaced
And all black, looking creepy
It's Charlie Scene
This shit is way too easy
I'm a give it to you quick
Go straight to your throat
Or put the burner in your mouth
And turn you into a ghost
All these people making music with nothing to show
Who doesn't have a band?
Shit, I don't know!
What kind of sane person drops his own name?
What kind of sane person boos his own band off stage?
What kind of sane person drops a verse like this?
These damn meds ain't working
I'm just too damn sick
Just you coming out here
It's got me provoked
Now I'm a cut your ass up like a line of coke
I'm a roll your crew up like a fat ass roach
And put you in my ashtray
Because you just got smoked

:
Lights out!
You're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth
Who the fuck are you now?
Lights out!
Can you feel it now?
We're calling you out
Who the fuck are you now?

:
Another classic case,
You crash and burn
:
And it's true
You're dead wrong
It's lights out, your last song
:
The world has turned it's face
You'll never learn
:
And it's true,
You're dead wrong
It's lights out, your last song
:
Walls closing in, they're falling down

:
Lights out!
You're talking too loud
So just shut your mouth
Who the fuck are you now?
Lights out!
Can you feel it now?
We're calling you out
Who the fuck are you now?

Lights out!
Can you feel it now?
We're calling you out
Who the fuck are you now?

Lights out!
You're talking too loud
Who the fuck are you now?
Who the fuck are you now?

LIGHTS OUT!
