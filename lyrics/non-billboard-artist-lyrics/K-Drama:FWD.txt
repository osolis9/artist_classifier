I cant say that I cant quit
But I cant say its that Im looking forward to it
I cant say that I cant wait
But I cant say its that Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward to it, Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward, looking forward,
Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward to it, Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward, looking forward,
Im looking forward to it
Me and god, go way back like 8 tracks and 8 dads
Used to be impatient, wanting everything asap
I used to say I cant wait, now I cant say that
Cause sooner than we think, we all gonna pay back
For 3 years Ive been quiet
Now Im really just plottin
Going over my options, making sure Im not floppin
Cant lose while Im globe trottin
Peas, I crossing eyes Im dottin
But now its time so Im droppin
Poppin out and I am not stopping
Man Im going in, gonna win
Overdose, Im flowin in
He ... Im born again, Im twisted like a contortionist
When I was a child, I spoke this one... i follow the sun
I come up age, Im a grown man
For the most part I keep my cookie bitten, I dont understand
I live ...i anticipate
Thats why you wont ever hear me say
I cant wait
I cant say that I cant quit
But I cant say its that Im looking forward to it
I cant say that I cant wait
But I cant say its that Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward to it, Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward, looking forward,
Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward to it, Im looking forward to it
Im looking forward, looking forward,
Im looking forward to it.
