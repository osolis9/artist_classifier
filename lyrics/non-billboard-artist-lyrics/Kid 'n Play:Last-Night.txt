Last-Night:Kid 'n Play
Last night, last night changed it all
Last night, I I I really had a ball
Last night

I was on the phone, my girl was tellin' me she was all alone
So I asked her if she was down to go
To Union Square, check out the show
She said, "O.K.", she'd never seen Red spin
In order to go she'd have to bring a friend
Thought if I hooked things up gettin' paid would be a shoo-in
Hmm, wonder what Playboy's doin'
Called up Play and asked if he'd, do me a favor, help me get skeezed

He said, "Alright, Kid, Imma do this for you
But make sure I get a piece too"
He gave me the sign
I gave him the cue, picked me up in his BMW

Last night, last night changed it all
Last night, I really had a ball
Last Night

At the house we just maxed
The girls came out ready to attack
Mine was dope, but his was wack
Play looked at me and said
"Yo, I ain't with that, I'm outta here"
He wanted to lose her
We got in the car, he began to abuse her
Broke on her face, said it was a crime

He said, "Your head's so bald, I could read your mind"
Aha ha, I covered my ears, tried not to listen
Laughin' so hard at how Play was dissin' her
All the way to Union Square
Hip-hoppers and coppers were everywhere
I have to admit it was quite a scare, y'all
Brooklyn, Brooklyn, yeah, that's right
Was terrorizin' the Square

Last night, last night changed it all
Last night, I really had a ball
Last night
Last night
Last night

I shoulda stayed at home
Now I'm stuck with a girl who won't leave me alone
Stoppin' the car to end this ride
Steppin' on line to get inside
Gettin' ends together to pay my fee and
Choked when she said, "Playboy is treatin'"
"No, I ain't payin', you know what I'm sayin'?"
"Yo, don't listen to him girls, hey, he's only playin'"

She was lucky, word, 'cos I was set to ill
But Kid winked, slipped me ten and said, "Chill"
We were finally inside, man, the music was dope
'Til a troop bum-rushed a guy for his rope
The next thing I knew a war broke out
Kid and his dipped north, me and mine skipped south

Last night, last night changed it all
Last night, I really had a ball
Last night

My man Hurb rocked beats
People started to dance and the riffin' ceased
I chilled upon the wall to catch my breath
Until this girlie jumped up and said, "This jam is def"
I saw she was a rebel, I was feelin' faint
The hot body of a devil, the face of saint
Could I have been wrong all night long?
Was this the girlie, I've been breaking on?

Upon further inspection I noticed somethin'
She was more than def, this girl was pumpin'
I felt small, as small as an elf
After the things I said I know I played myself
But I kicked it live and I must admit it
It sounded good when she said, "I'm with it"

Last night, last night changed it all
Last night, I really had a ball
Last night

Last night
