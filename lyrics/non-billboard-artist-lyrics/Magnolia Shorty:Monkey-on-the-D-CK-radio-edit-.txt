Barclay James Harvest, The
Gone To Earth
Spirit On The Water
There's a spirit floating on the water
There's a shadow lying down by the shore
Wasn't he there a year before?
A sacrifice for the coat he's wearing
A 'paradise' for the lady
Who dares colour him red upon the shore?

We carry the burden upon our shoulder
We carry their lives in the palm of our hand
Don't you care about the state you're in
Or don't you understand?

See the spirit floating on the water
See the shadow lying down by the shore
Wasn't he there some years before?


We carry the burden upon our shoulder
We carry their lives in the palm of our hand
Don't you care about the state you're in
Or don't you understand?
