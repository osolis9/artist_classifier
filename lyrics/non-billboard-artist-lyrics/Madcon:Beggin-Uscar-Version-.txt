Beggin-Uscar-Version-:Madcon
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin'
Beggin', put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, baby

Ridin' high when I was king
Played it hard and fast 'cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

I'm beggin' you, won't you give your hand out, baby
Beggin', put your lovin' hand out, baby

I need you to understand
That I tried too hard to be a man
The kind of man you'd want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell I used to be
Shadow of my life is hangin' over me
Broken man that I don't know
Will leave it standing, devil's dancing with my soul

Beggin' you, won't you give your hand out, baby
Beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, baby

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
No, I just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring is a shade of black

I'm beggin' you, won't give your hand out, baby
Beggin', put your lovin' hand out, baby
Beggin' you
