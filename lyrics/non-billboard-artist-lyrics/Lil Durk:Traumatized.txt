Traumatized:Lil Durk
Head shot'll leave 'em traumatized
A lot of niggas say I got this money on my mind
I see they want me, but it ain't my time
See me out here like I am a little traumatized
Traumatized, traumatized
See me out here like I am a little traumatized
Traumatized, traumatized
See me out here like I am a little traumatized
Drama, they don't want no drama with the drumma
Be cool, protect yo' self like a condom
Chasing commas, head shot, no running
See me on top but make you sick to your stomach
D.A. on my dick, I got Edai song in the whip
Cause it's gucci, nunu got the uzi flip the script it's like a movie
He gon' start shooting like a movie
Chopper bullets frr-ah, pardon me
See me as a opp then you looking from right across the street
You ain't no hitta if you shooting niggas from 'cross the street
Probably they be GBE only cause I'm popping C
Acting shit, I ain't with that acting shit
Straight drop
Headshot, headshot, you in the morgue boy
Brought a whole lot guns, you ain't gon' blow it boy
Run up on you by the corner store
Then I leave you by that corner store
Mama crying, police flying
Red tape, homicide
Stay in, don't come outside, 'cause it's war time
Less peace and more dying yeah, less peace and more dying
Bottle party, teddy bears, lit candles
Niggas pussy, don't stay strapped ripped sandles
Come around, a whole lot of niggas soundless
Clip going boh boh
