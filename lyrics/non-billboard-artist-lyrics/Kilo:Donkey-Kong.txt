Go go go go (x 8) 

Chorus 
Well this my pinky this my thumb 
Bankhead bounce donkey kong (x4) 

[Verse 1] 
Well it's a brand new dance and it's coming your way 
It was started in the south by the DJ 
There's some say it's hard but it ain't true 
It's the only dance that'll ? for you 
Just bounce to the right bounce to the left 
You can Bankhead Bounce by yourself 
Anyone can do it just let me know 
I know a little spot where we can go 
But first, you gotta do this dance 
When you Bankhead Bounce you get one chance 
If you fall, then it's not for you 
But if you fly, then you true 
And you gotta be real and don't fake 
If you don't bounce hard enough you won't make it 
The early bird, get the worm 
Bankhead Bounce, said it's my turn 

Chorus (x4) 

[Verse 2] 
If I'm riding down the street doing the Bankhead Bounce 
And I got more bounce to the weigh to the ounce 
If I bounce down, I bounce up 
Bankhead, yeah what's up 
Little suckers don't know what I'm saying 
Get off the wall and let me see you dance 
Cuz it ain't no party like a Kilo party 
Cuz the rest of these parties won't hit 
And I promise the Lord I won't bump no more 
With a big fat overweight trick 
Cuz it's out with the old and in with the new 
Bankhead Bounce now whatcha gon' do 
Bankhead Bounce betta than all of them 
I say ooh damn, ooh damn 
Put your hands in the air and do it just like that 
Hold on wait a minute, bring it on back 

Chorus (x4) 

[Verse 3] 
Little sucker don't know who I'm talkin' 'bout 
Kilo jam make ya get, get, get out 
Slip slide stop, everybody drop 
You ain't never been down to a zero 
But ya got the nerve to talk about Kilo 
Ain't no love for these scrubs in the lane 
They hate to see me when I do my thing 
Deep in the jungle that's where you can find me 
With lions and tigers and bears all around me 
Represent that's what I'm gon' do 
Thank you ladies and gentlemen 
Each and every one of you 
I don't need no publicity 
And all I wanna know is did ya miss me? 
Of course you did 
Now Bankhead Bounce you crazy trick.
