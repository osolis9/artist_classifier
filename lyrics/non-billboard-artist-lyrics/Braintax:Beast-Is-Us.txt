Beast-Is-Us:Braintax
[talking: man]
... to face the fact
That in a democratic country, we are responsible for what our government's do
And the only way we can expiate that responsibility is to
Use every breath we have, everything we can do
To demonstrate our utter rejection of the criminal acts of our government's

[Verse 1:]
Apartheid on West Bank - nobody cares
Shots coming from the left flank, the kids unaware
Refugee camps a death camp, live by the flares
I'm here to treat me like I got opinions nobody shares?
My politics is more than just 'f**k Tony Blair'
Gordon Brown, David Cameron, that's why I'm still standing
I'm more inclined to expose Israel to their apartheid
Bring on your excuses, the truth is you can't hide
Even when our politicians in the West act righteous and piest
Doing what they do best - start talking all about road maps and shit
While Israelis are busy busting caps and shit
Got the bulldozers out and constructing shit
This place another farmer but that land is his
When Hamas fired rockets Israel rebounds
Kills five times more, locks the checkpoints down
How the f**k you putting checkpoints there to start with?
When that land's Palistinian, it's known and it's chartered
Collective punishment, they dish it out daily
So I hate Israel but I don't hate Israelis
Do you get that? Think a little bit before you get pissed
And is it any wonder Gaza kids adopt a death wish
And don't beleive that being Jewish is the same as being pro-Zionist
That's a Zionist game to make you think cussing Israel's a racist view
I don't think so, but I'll tell you what racists do
To make you think that other people's are stupid and mean
And get to killing 'em - Like Sharon did in Geneve
Start provoking 'em - Like Sharon did at Temple Mount
Same way Bush is always calling Muslims out
Same way the Home Office over here is always calling minorities out
Calling you racists out
f**k some 'baby baby' shit, some 'get go f**k a bitch' gravy gravy shit
BRAINTAX GAVE YOU THIS
You wanna be like "I was too serious"
I'll say stay ignorant and I'll stay curious

[Chorus:]
Ask the rest of the world - The beast is us
Wanna buy another weapon - The beast is us
Wanna get away with murder - The beast is us
We're the West and the beast is us
Ask the rest of the planet - The beast is us
Want to buy another missile - The beast is us
Yesteryear we trust bombs from Russia with love
But nowadays I guess the beast is us (The beast is us)

[Verse 2:]
Short memories allay [? ]
Spit 'bout crimes we forget for the sake of our own little tragedy's
Incidental maladies
Irrelivant like a f**king Akon balladist
The biggest shame of this society we live in
While we act all spiritual when we're money driven
It's the way we forget in a hell of a rush
Like 'If it ain't affecting me then I ain't too fussed'
Then there's bombs on the street and us Brits get shaky
But how can we be shot - Check our leadership lately?
They're rattling to save us, talking 'bout Jesus
Fundementalist believers acting like crusaders
Memories are short over here
The zeitgeist is a truck that the media steer
So we ain't on the streets protesting - We're stuck in front of TV sex digesting
Forgetting about the lies and the unfound weapons
Suggestions, the questions we should be asking journalists a second
I'm (BRAAAIIIIN) taxing - the opposite of asprin
Blood is on the streets and the East End soaking it up
Bush making me a target - and I'm not too pleased
There's no peace when the beast is us

[Chorus]

[talking: woman]
... We see other families in the area suffer very heavy casualties
Perhaps 160 wounded were taken to Gaza City Shifa Hospital last night
There are more than two dozen still in hospital
Head wounds, fractures, burns from flying pieces of metal
Among them are many children
The very high civillian casualty toll from the assasination attempt
Has really fuelled the fire of revenge here
People are saying that Hamas is retaliatory
That strike against Israel is inevitable now
And that likely means a suicide attack on Israeli cities
