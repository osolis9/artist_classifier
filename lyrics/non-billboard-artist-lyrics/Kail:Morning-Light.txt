Morning-Light:Kail
In the heat of the morning light
When I open mine, to see your eyes
The sun never seemed so bright
Got me achin here mama
Little more last night

Cause you and me is all I ever wanted darlin'
The saints do sing, every morning now
It's so plan to see
You got a hold on me

In the evening
The darkness steals the sky
If love had a perfect moment,
it would be right now
Cause all, has never seemed so right
Got me shakin here mama
From this thing I feel inside

Cause you and me
is all I ever wanted darlin'
The saints do sing,
every morning now
It's so plan to see, yeah
That you've got a hold on me

Sleep now baby,
close your eyes and lie
