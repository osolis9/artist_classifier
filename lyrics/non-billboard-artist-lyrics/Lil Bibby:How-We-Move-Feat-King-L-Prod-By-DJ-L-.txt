Honey B with the cool, that's how we move,
My young boys got the tool, that's how we move.
Got the tool for the school, that's how we move,
That's how we move, that's how we move.

Got the tool for the school, that's how we move,

I'm rap God, I trap hard, this shit ain't that hard,
They act hard, let the max bar turn niggas to track stars.
There's no limit, I'm gonna get it, don't sneak this on S squad,
Fuck with this, don't fuck in minutes, don't waste time with that, bro,
Gun niggas, drug dealers, some of my niggas crack hearts,
He is talking that talk-talk, the shit as fat as that boy.
Young niggas, we savage, catch a nigga in traffic,
Niggas down in my city, they're like please stop the madness.
MOB, that's how I be, I put this money shit before me
And my old homie just get three, just let all my niggas free.
Been round and round with that heat, but I try to keep the peace,
All this fuss on these streets trying to get a name off me.
You don't want that beef, his body on that heat
And the last nigga that traded me is go rest in peace.
Nigga, you don't want that beef, my niggas won't go sweet,
The last nigga that tried me is so rest in peace.

I ain't with that fuck shit, tell a fuck nigga suck dick,
Take this moment, earning that, get you waked and ugly.
All of hurt, no subshit, cracking cards, all dub shit,
D12, I'm a milli man, run the blickers in the mini-van.
I'm leg-leg, I'm leg, spark em up and then we're getting there
For these bitches I get real there, other words, she get free head.
I'm on operation throwing shit, so long you should get through with it.
Smoking dope in a form will, dirty money got a nigga clean.
Open heads in the magazine, turn a party into a murder scene.
If I send them, then they're murdering, silent shots, they ain't hear a thing.
MOB won't give a bird a wing, straight drop, they ain't hit the lean.
Double trigger forty with a beam, really show me what a nigga mean.
Fake shots on the back block, try to run, get your back pop,
Ak make it messed up, flip a nigga like a laptop.
Thirty shot got my hand hot, low income, we ain't saying shit.
We are on that plan shit, will come to spread shit.

That's how we move, that's how we move.
