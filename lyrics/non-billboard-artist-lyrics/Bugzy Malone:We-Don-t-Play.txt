We-Don-t-Play:Bugzy Malone
Kill or be killed
Savages...
Kill or be killed
Savages...
Kill or be killed
Savages...


They know that we're savages
Know that we're cold
We come from the road
We never go bookah we're digging for gold
We're digging for gold
Not only does she wanna know
She want me to roll
She's getting down with the cam on the look
Down with the cam on the look

Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay

No fuckboys in my section
Nothing but cacao in my complexion
Don't you know I got diamonds in my rolex
And we're not gonna sleep nigga that's no rest
I'm gonna leave it fading on gravy
I got the bangers where the mash is crazy
Wanna drink from my table then pay me
Th-th-that bitch is shady
Th-th-that bitch can persuade me
She says she knows who I am
Cause she's seen my face on the gram
She did have a 1 but he's gone
Somebody pass me the Don Perignon
Can you pass me the Don Perignon
I made money from drugs
Made money from drugs
I was mixing the does with the buds
Mixing the does with the buds
The money was good
All the money was good
Money was the only good thing in the hood
Only good thing in the hood

They know that we're savages
Know that we're cold
We come from the road
We never go bookah we're digging for gold
We're digging for gold
Not only does she wanna know
She want me to roll
She's getting down with the cam on the look
Down with the cam on the look

Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay

I'm fadin' she noticed
I needed a song for the roadies
I'm famous he's lonely
Don't let him pretend that he knows me
Why they so nosy
They wish they could phone me
I bang it in
I'm a striker she a goalie
She eat it up like I'm guacamole
If you wanna take it off you better hit the switch
I'm grabbin' her throat she's grabbin' my dick
And now this bitch's tryna bite my lip
Don't she know I'm a badboy I don't like to kiss
Shot's through the black now we hit the strip
Man don't play man are built for this
All my niggas working money mitch
And I'm like the dark-skin version of Richie Rich



They know that we're savages
Know that we're cold
We come from the road
We never go bookah we're digging for gold
We're digging for gold
Not only does she wanna know
She want me to roll
She's getting down with the cam on the look
Down with the cam on the look

Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
Don't you know we dont play-ay-ay-ay
