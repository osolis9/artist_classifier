Noose-Hanger:Tone
I cant seem to grasp the thought of your kind. 
Burning sorrow into someone through selfish actions. 
You're the cause of this hell. 
A slap on the wrist sentence shows no justice. 
Commit your needs and face the noose. 
Your victims hold the rope 
as you strangle pleaing for forgiveness. 
As your feet dangle reaching for the soil. 
Your past is projected in front of you. 
You feel the suffering burning your soul. 
Your eyes roll back into your head as you're set to flames. 
Watching your self desend to hell.
