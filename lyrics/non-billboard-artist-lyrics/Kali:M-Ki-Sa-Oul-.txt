M-Ki-Sa-Oul-:Kali
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I've kept my promise, don't keep your distance
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I've kept my promise, don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more that I can think of to say to you
All you got to do is look at me
To know that every word is true
Oh, don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I've kept my promise, don't keep your distance
I've kept my promise, don't keep your distance
