Bad:Ash Kardash
Mongamy or whatever they call it im starting to think it don’t exsist
Because it seems like every dude I know got a main girl and a side chick
But pardon me for judging you I guess that’s all im exposed to but to the dudes
Like that, this is for you..

Is it bad that he never mad love, he never did No
did but he sure know how to fuck, cause he’s a bad boy
no good to me, I cant promise that he bad for me
cause he has some issues, he wont commit 
no not havin it but a t least he can admit that he is a bad boy to me
yeah he’ll be good and bad, but he’ll be bad for me
but, he’ll bad for me

Verse 1
Let’s get it, good boys aint no fun
And the bad boys aint about shit
And the hood niggas want a good girl
And everybody want a bad bitch
So it seems we feen for the opposite
Cause they say we attract like magnets
In the end maybe that’s why we never work
And we just loose touch like a bad grip
Cause I mean like all the dudes I date
End up being dudes I hate
And I be thinking how it ended so wrong
When it seems it started so great like
This dude used to make me laugh
But Now I cant stand his ass
And I used to wanted to be his wife
But now he just apart of my past
Cause the love turned into hate
Happiness turned into pain
The smiles turned into tears 
And the pride turned into shame cause he’s a bad boy
That never mad no love and never had no chick 
But he sure know how to fuck

Is it bad that he never mad love, he never did No
did but he sure know how to fuck, cause he’s a bad boy
no good to me, I cant promise that he bad for me
cause he has some issues, he wont commit 
no not havin it but a t least he can admit that he is a bad boy to me
yeah he’ll be good and bad, but he’ll be bad for me
but, he’ll bad for me

let me tell you about him
he hurt feelings he break hearts
he stay quiet he play smart
he take pride in going out
and pulling girls to see what they about
he no saint but he don’t pose 
he don’t never break bread but he pull hoes
when he on the scene he be jay’ed up
if your looking for him you could find him layed up 
he got haters but we all do 
he be having girls hooked like bait food
girl look at all those lines you fell for
now your nose wide open like roscoe
naïve to believe he meant that
thought he would get attached but he unlatched
thought yall would get close but he fell back
now your on stand by like a dispatch
tears running down your check like a wayne tatt
flippin out upset like a mad hat
from the jump should known he a bad match
but you gotta ask

Is it bad that he never mad love, he never did No
did but he sure know how to fuck, cause he’s a bad boy
no good to me, I cant promise that he bad for me
cause he has some issues, he wont commit 
no not havin it but a t least he can admit that he is a bad boy to me
yeah he’ll be good and bad, but he’ll be bad for me
but, he’ll bad for me
