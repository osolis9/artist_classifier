"Read Me My Rights"by brantley gilbert

Somebody better call the law
We done took it outside we're about to brawl
Ol' boy done put his hands on a woman
Where I come from, son, the next thing comin' is a
Ass whoopin' in the parkin' lot
Gonna drop this fool right in front of the cops
Be proud of what I done
I ain't gonna run

Just read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I'll do my time and raise my right hand
I'll tell the judge, I'd do that shit again

I heard it through the grapevine
Good daddy and a husband is a doin' time
Said his wife and his kids were in the house
Ol' boy broke in man it all went south
When he dropped the hammer on his forty five
Now he's in the pen twenty five to life
Lord knows if it'd have been me
I'd have to say

Read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I'll do my time and raise my right hand
I'll tell the judge I'd do it again

If I have to put the law in my hands its about to break
Cause I know right from wrong and if you cross that line
Boy all I gotta say is

Read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I'll do my time raise my right hand
I'll tell the judge I'll do that shit again
