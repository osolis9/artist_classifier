Click-Clack:40 Cal
(40 Cal)

Dipset, Skeme, Let's get it poppin
Told niggas 3 verses ago ya not fuckin wit me

(Verse 1 40 Cal)

Look, I'm no argue critic I spark the biscuit
That'll throw back more caps than starter fitteds
I'm from Harlem, Lenox where cars a kitted
Where niggas a borrow ya gun just to rob you wit it
See you could put out ya DVDs to help yo ass
But it's like a mobile home cause ya trailer trash
Thats why I sell work and melt the bags
Cause the dimes so big it's lookin like Alka Seltzer tabs
And the customers know that ya bubblin slow
Before the movie I been had hustle and flow
That's why I double my dough and keepin my game tight
Shoppin spree cop a key re-up the same night
Yo Killa I don't think they readin my name right
Cause it don't take a genius to see that i'm way nice
I pop, pop, pop that thing
When I rhyme call me the rewind that king
Wit a combat swing and a nine that bling
I get signed by fall and drop by spring

(Chorus)

What, What, What you wanna talk about
What, What, What you wanna talk about
We see em (Where) We leavin (Yea)
He schemin he be beastin
Heard he kill people we believe em
Oh shit he's reachin (Get down)
It goes, Click Clack What you wanna talk about
Click Clack What you wanna talk about
Click Clack What you wanna talk about
Don't make me call you out and have my niggas chalk it out

(Verse 2 A-Mafia)

You know I stay on the grind I ain't never late
I handle mine when it's time I don't hesitate
So when you see that long nine you better skate
Bottom line i'm here to get mines so get the record straight
They rock expensive necklaces 600 Benz's and Lexus'
You don't understand what the messege is
We roll out and swerve lanes huned thousand on the bird chain
Nigga it's Purple City Byrd Gang
Yea i hope you heard man what i'm talkin bout
Eagle surroundin you get back when the hawk is out
Me im what New York is about
Ain't no singin here the king is here
Cling to ya chair imma do my thing this year
So much bling in here it might hurt ya eyes
I'm the first to ride my gangsta is certified
I'm on point like a hollow tip
My niggas swallow Crist you wanna get money then dummy follow this

(Chorus)

We see em (Where) We leavin (Yea)
He schemin he be beastin
Heard he kill people we believe em
Oh shit he's reachin (Get down)
It goes, Click Clack What you wanna talk about (Nuffin)
Click Clack What you wanna talk about (Nuffin)
Click Clack What you wanna talk about (Yea)
Don't make me call you out and have my niggas chalk it out

(Verse 3 40 Cal)

Look, I'll put you in a body cast Glad lock body bag
Laugh and probably brag that's how I lolly gag
I'm the truth with no polygraph shotty blast
Spaz and skate wit ya ice wit no hockey mask
I play Jason Diddy bop wit my cocky ass
The dime on the block more brolic than Oxy pads
Thats the punchline they comin like boxin jabs
Some niggas like 40 got an adoption swag
Niggas see me play follow the rapper
Go to the store and cop them a bottle of swagger
Ma next time you see a nigga holla'n at ya
Don't need a oxygen mask to realize that he gassed ya
Up like his life real a couple of ice grills a get a nigga hit wit the truck wit the spike grill, ILL
I give a fuck how ya life feel
All i'm worried bout is blood fuckin up the nice wheels, chill
