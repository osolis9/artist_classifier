Hard-Work:Stig of the Dump
I can turn my hand to any style I want, depending on what vibe I'm on/
Love, peace & happiness, to bang him with an iron rod/
Whiney little Emo, to an ego like I'm a god
& I could make a pile of gwop but fuck it I just pied it off
Cos I refuse to compromise my lot just for the sterling/
I'm me for every penny of the pounds that I've been earning/
And one thing that's for certain, I'll keep the fire burning/
And stay true to myself until I face the final curtain/
I've been working like a dog, so please forgive me if I bark a bit
I don't give a toss if you're a badman when your bars are shit
It's a major labels loss because they don't know how to market this/
A living definition of what an independent artist is
So bump your system loud
Turn you music up, ‘cos I'm a bun the system down
Keep ice & chains cos I aint come to piss about
This is a different sound, I'll kill it til the industry is disembowelled
It's time to get the money in
Style raw enough to make ya eyes water like an onion
I tell the truth I tryna be a funny en
Bring the greatest of all time & I'm a curry him
I'm tryna build a brand from the ground up
Been broke now I'm tryna get the pounds up
For now the whole brow stays frowned up
Until I see the figures in my bank account mount up
Grinding like a coke heads teeth
Bars are intricately woven so the flow gets peak
I wan't paying but ain't making that processed cheese
Cos I aint tryna write a track about a Rolex Sweep.
Peep. it gets deep without an aqua lung
So there's passion in the bars when I'm rapping ‘em
Syncopate the war cry to the banging drum
Can in hand, mastering my art like Alex Young
I work twice as hard as the next guy
On the hustle til the second that the cheques signed
I don't belive that I can settle in my next life
You're only here once you know & homie, I'm a get mine.
But I aint all about the peso,
I don't play thug with just the right amout of J-Lo
Bills still come in by the day so
I'm tryna get em studying my quotes like Plato
Cos courage is knowing what not to fear
So if ya think I'm shook of ya tough act you're on the gear
This aint a pop track, talking bout it's hot in here
I'm tryna make the rent off the realness they wanna hear
I been through drama in my life & it aint over yet
But I learnt from my mistakes so like the ink suggests, No Regrets
If ya here to stack some chips, that's some shit I won't respect
My bars are born from moments where the rhythm & my soul connect
I work hard, it's hard work
When you're tryna put the art first
But i admit that i'm in love with the music
I'm just sick of seeing suckers abuse it, that's why;
I work hard, it's hard work
When you're tryna put the art first
I admit i'm still in love with the music
I'm just sick of seeing suckers abuse it
That's true shit.
