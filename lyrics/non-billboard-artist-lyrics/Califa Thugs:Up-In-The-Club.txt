Up-In-The-Club:Califa Thugs
When I walked in all eyes on me
can't help it cause the light's shining off me
cause I'm blinging in the lounge and VIP
all the women in the house want LPG
we doing some damage in the cabbage causing static
grab my automatic and let these putos have it
we these LPG's and we in the club getting high tonight
I already identified plenty of haters in the sky
before enemies can carry on me on my side
fuck it checking a cutie on the dance floor
pushing that ass up back up
all of my homies and these putos act up
my gat's tucked but I'm just here to have a good time
there's to much pussy up in the place to trip on good times
I'm surrounded by C's D's and double D's
some down ass women that freak me down to they knees

as we walked up in this club we don't know who to trust
it's these LPG gangsters who just walked in the club
make a toast to the ladies who be shaking it up
and to the fus in the club don't be hating on us
cause we some playas ready to ride
and we some gangstas ready die
why you mad dog if you can't talk all the shit to my face
bitch you better back offthat's all

Califa Thugs are coming through

Stupid fools always hate on us
