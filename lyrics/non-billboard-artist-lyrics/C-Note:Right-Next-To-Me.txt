Right Next To Me
Good bye, it's time for me to go.
I'll call you in the morning so i can let you know.
I know it hasn't been easy to love a man like me.
Someday if we try there will be no goodbyes, and we will live happily.
Cuz i'll be there one day and you'll be right next to me.
I'll be there one day and you will be right next to me.
Hey there, will you be where i am?
Will you be by myside girl, or with another man?
Just wait a little longer, girl
I don't know how long.
Just try to understand this is not what i planned.
I'm sorry this had to be.
Oh girl, every man needs a woman.
You're the woman that i choose and i can't afford to lose you baby.
I'll be there one day and you will be right next to me.
I'll be there one day and you will be right next to me.
I swear to the world, you'll always be my girl.
Just say you'll be, right next to me.
I'll be there one day
And you'll be right next to me.
