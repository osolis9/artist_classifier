What-s-My-Life-Like:Skinnyman
Now what's my life like?
It's like suttin that don't work right
It's like an alcoholic sippin' a red stripe
It's not enough but it might quench his thirst
But he can't wait for the next can to burst and what's worse
is he don't when to stop, till he's over the top.
His world's spinning, his body takes a drop on the floor and it's raw and what's more he just wants more to pour till he's snoring, waking up with his kidneys feeling sore.
He's left wondering what was it all really for just like a brother who's been fighting for the next mans war.
That's what my life's like.

What's my life like?
It's suttin what a sharp knife's like.
Suttin' that might cut up your hand if it held right.
And it don't make sense to hold tighter neither.
The tighter you try grip me I will only cut you deeper.
But hold me down the right way and i will work for you.
I'll do as you command me to, I'll leave people hurt for you.
Wipe me down and leave me free from stains like the memories of yesterdays pains that still remains.
I'll stay close to you, know by a few are unrevealed so that your enemies won't know that me and you have got the deal.
When it's time to come out i will forever stay real, Ilive by the sword, defend by the shield for real
That's what my life's like.

So what's my life like?
It's suttin what a crack pipe's like.
Suttin that tastes sweet but don't make you act right.
It might have you on the streets on a late night searching for the paper to fulfill this addctive nature.
It makes you feel like the world hates ya, but you want it to alleviate ya just to make ya feel greater.
You're paranoid dealing with your friends and your foes.
Through lifes experience dealing with the highs and the lows.
The doors closed, the music's down nobody's there, except me with a madman stare.
That's what my life's like
What my life's like
That's what my life's like
