Sometimes-I-Cry-Myself-to-Sleep:JR & PH7
Sometimes I cry when I think of you
Sometimes I cry it's just something I do
Sometimes I cry when I'm by myself
Sometimes it'd be nice to have some help

I think I cry most when I'm in the shower
If I cried earlier in the day it could take an hour
Sometimes I cry when I just can't fall asleep
But then the tears end up in my bed drenching my sheets

Sometimes I cry myself to sleep
Sometimes I cry and feel the pain (Woah oh oh. Woah oh oh)
Sometimes I cry to feel relief
Sometimes I cry and I scream your name

Sometimes I cry when I am all alone
I always try to cry when no ones home
I let it all out; I let all the tears pour
And when I clean my tears up I go back for more.

When I have to cry I lock the door to my room
I hope no one comes in to see what I do
I'm crying and crying till I fall asleep
And I lay my head back down and feel that relief

Sometimes I cry myself to sleep
Sometimes I cry and feel the pain (Woah oh oh. Woah oh oh)
Sometimes I cry to feel relief
Sometimes I cry and I scream your name

(Bridge / Rap)

I cried last night and I cried again in morning (I need a should to cry on)
I'll cry in an hour and I'll cry without a warning
When I see your picture I always start to tear up
But then I let myself cry I and start to cheer up
You keep on given me a reason to cry (I need a should to cry on)
Another reason to let go, and way to unwind
And I'm sittin' here workin' up the strength again to bawl
All I wanna do is let these tears fall
Yeah!

Sometimes I cry myself to sleep
Sometimes I cry and feel the pain (Woah oh oh. Woah oh oh)
Sometimes I cry to feel relief
Sometimes I cry and I scream your name
Sometimes I cry myself to sleep (I need a shoulder to cry on)
Sometimes I cry and feel the pain (Woah oh oh. Woah oh oh)
Sometimes I cry to feel relief (I need a shoulder to cry on)
Sometimes I cry and I scream your name
