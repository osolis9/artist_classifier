You just to watch you fall and
I'm still on my tippy toes, keys to my city close
Cause they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah

Pivot 'til they all stop, hustle back
Run a play, catch a stack
Countin' purple of hundreds like they counterfeit
Who be richer now?

Clock don't stop, gotta clock this cash
Uhh, bet I knew that in the past
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Been in this shit since '93
Runnin' like Mike back in '92

Super Bowl Shuff 'til you get that ring
Pop said make it, it don't have to make you
Say you miss the old Vic, bitch me too
We was on the road, I ain't have no job
I ain't get no tick, I ain't have no watch
No whip, nope, but I had that squad
They wimme nah, run up on you like the Flintstones
You six feet down, bam, bam

That was the innanet, now catch me in traffic
Been at the train station, Cuba packin', paid vacation
And I'm stayin' with my own force, servin'
