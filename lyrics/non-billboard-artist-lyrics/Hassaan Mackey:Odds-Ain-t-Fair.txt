"And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
Just can't help myself oooh"
Since you ain't never been here before let's take a lil' tour
Eat with the rich, starve with the poor
Trade you a piece of my war story for yours
Minus braggadocios, dope punchlines and metaphors
Double barrel pump shotguns be blarin' off
On blocks where churches across from corner stores
Sellin' poison, hearin' noise from car be them boys
With it blastin' it sound it like crashin' them boards
Watch cop car stop to ask it's our chore right?
Weed, speed the same thing as yours ock
Tryin' to score a piece of the pie before it dissipates
The vanishin' is smoke to life, let's participate
Put your hands together in unison
To demonstrate the reason we grow up young guns with demo tapes
Starin' at the venues of light, tryin' to vision straight
Pullin' at the fabric and tearin' at the ticket tape
I got my eyes on the prize of life
Got my hands on the mic device
Like it might be the last time
Speak about a place in the world where we hardly see the sunshine
And even though the sun shine
It's cold out here, still I move in the world with no fear
And I ain't runnin' like I'm scared
Got it on me, I came prepared
"And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
Just can't help myself oooh"
Since you ain't never been here before let's take a lil' tour
Give with the rich, steal from the poor
Trade you a piece of my history for yours
Just to find out who's weight in this world is worth more
The man with the plan in his hand is dyin' to score
In a world full of terror and gunshots galore
Goin' off in the midst of tryin' to get yours
The rules never stick to life's main accord
You fightin' in a war on turf that ain't yours
And the killer killin'? for all who ain't saw
Then blame it on y'all like it starts with the heart exists
But hates man escapes through targets
The target is dollarless, pharmacists heartless, hard as they armor is
Stashin' they dope where they momma live
This is what drama is
Honor gets traded for scholarships
Based on how well you can chop and sit
I got my eyes on the prize of life
Got my hands on the mic device
Like it might be the last time
Speak about a place in the world where we hardly see the sunshine
And even though the sun shine
It's cold out here, still I move in the world with no fear
And I ain't runnin' like I'm scared
Got it on me, I came prepared
"And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
And I can't help myself
Just can't help myself oooh
Just can't help myself oooh"
