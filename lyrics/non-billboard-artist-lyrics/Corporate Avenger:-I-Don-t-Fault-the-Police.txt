-I-Don-t-Fault-the-Police:Corporate Avenger
Freedom is a state of mind,
A mind is a state of being,
Stay the Fuck outa my mind and my being.

I dont fault the police
Cause the people that run um got um on a short leash
I dont fault the police
Cause the people that run um divide and deseace

I dont cry when the police die cause they prolly deserved it,
Run around with a badge and a gun
And they god damn fuck with everyone.
Inforce rules made by fools,
Violence and fear there tools
They dress to impress with there laws they arrest
And they leave us powerless

I dont fault the police
Cause the people that run um got um on a short leash
I dont fault the police
Cause the people that run um divide and deseace

We have created a reality based on fear where a terriost a ganster or a police can take away ur freedom or your sense of security at any time.

I don't cry when a Gangster dies cause he prolly deserved it,
They run around with a bag and a gun
And they god damn fuck with everyone,
Inforce rules made by fools
Violence and fear there tools
They dress to impress thinkin fear is respect
And they leave us powerless.

I dont fault the police
Cause the people that run um got um on a short leash
I dont fault the police
Cause the people that run um divide and deseace

A society that incarartes there own population for any minor infraction where there is 100's opon 1000's of pages and pages of laws and reason for the district atourney and the local juristiction and the justice system to put its entire force to removing an individual from his family connection and make him sepreate from the tribal earth.

I dont cry when a terriost dies cause he prolly desevered it,
Run around with a bomb and a gun,
And they god damn fuck with every one.
Inforce rules made by fools,
Violence and fear there tools.
Bombs fall from the sky
And a mom as she cries as she watches her baby die.
