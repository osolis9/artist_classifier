Yeah We up in the club, I see her do her thang,
You might wanna' rap, but she'll make you sing,
See I was on her, but she was on him,
She all up on ma thang, I got my thang on her hip
She ATL pop, don't know how to act,
She left for one song, and came right back,
Gindin on me, the rest of the night
Her man started muggin', he could see it in my eyes,

Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high, (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll, (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go, (I love your girl)
I'm sorry I got it in for your girl, girlfriend

She run her fingers through her hair, he tryin ta call her over there but she like, (Fuck! That nigga!)
She drop it down to the floor, I'm sayin shorty you should go, but she like (Fuck! That nigga!)
Call it in "ENVY", I want her on me, all up in my head, now she in my bed,
I, I, I, I

Got her on patron, she actin' all bad,
Your Girl chose me, Don't be mad.

The way she rock that, got the boy in love,
And I pray that y'all ain't serious, cause seriously shes on my dick.
