If-I-Were-a-Jedi-That-Would-Be-Hella-Awesome-:MC Lars
VERSE 1: 

This beat is my recital, I think it’s very vital 
to use (the force) for good (of course) 
Lars Skywalker that’s my title! (here we go!) 

If I were a Jedi, I could out rap Busta Rhymes 
Going in like Qui-Gon Jinn for the win, I could flow in quadruple time 
And at the Canadian border, every time I went on tour 
I’d be like “this is not the undeclared MC Lars merch that you’re looking for" 
I could levitate like Yoda, I'd eradicate ebola 
I could pick up girls, literally, even master the viola 
I could read all of War and Peace in ten minutes, 
entirely in Russian just to say that I did it 
I could even catch that golden snitch playing Quidditch 
(Wait, wrong movie, innit?) 
Podracing up the 101, surpassing Golden Gate traffic (whoo!) 
R2 on the roof of my Prius (dude), I could FaceTime holographic 
I’d play for the A’s and we'd win every game 
Resurrect Mac Dre do it all for the Bay 
They’d all say hey Lars is neato 
And always let me cut the line at El Farrolito 

Two years ago, a friend of mine, 
asked me to say some Jedi rhymes 
so I said this rhyme, I’m about to say, 
I fought the Sith and it went this way 

CHORUS: 

If I were a Jedi, bet I’d get all the ladies 
I would mack it more than Dumbledore or Leto Atreides 
If you try to strike me down I’ll just be more powerful 

If I were a Jedi, that would be hella awesome 

(Singin’!) 

Do or do not there is no try! 
Do or do not there is no try! 
Do or do not, there is no try! 
And if you don’t believe it you will fail every time 

It’s a trap! (x2) 
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
It’s a trap!
