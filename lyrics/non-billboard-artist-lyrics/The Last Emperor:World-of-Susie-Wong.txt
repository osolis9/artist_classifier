World-of-Susie-Wong:The Last Emperor
I'm looking for Suzi Wong
Tell me have you seen her
I need her before I step inside the arena
We lost touch and let Philly come between us
Warrior princess, she's stronger than Xena
I know niggas that can't wait to get between her
But if you get cold with her it's more than a misdemeanor
My homeboy said she was more beautiful than Selena
So I let him hit it and he fell into a seizure
Caught amnesia from Suzi getting tossed up
Fives, tens, twenties it don't cost much
Compared to other chicks they all suck
We lost touch I heard lately she's dating this kid they call Dutch
They got off to an incredible start
She gave him wild ideas about blowing the charts
And when she broke up with Dutch it split 'em apart
I guess she captures a man's mind as well as his heart

*CHORUS*
Suzi gives me sanctuary
She's a place for me to hide
A place where we get high

What kind of man am I
Tell me the truth 'cause I just can't stand a lie
I can't find her but I'll still be a man and try
For Suzi's affection I'll punch out a samurai
Made for admiring, no woman's flyer than
She calms me down with a stroke of the violin
She brings peace to the streets filled with violence
Put down the guns and let the l's start firing
Words I speak send the weak into retirement
Evel Kanievel styles straight deaf defying men
Open the door before I let the empire in
Tell me where she is break the code of silence
Keeps me hungry she startles and stuns me
I went from clean cut to low down dirty and grungy
After one pull in some undiscovered country
No man could ever stop Suzi from speaking bluntly

*CHORUS*

They tell me time and time again that shit is real
The slightest touch gives Suzi the illest feel
Take one pull and watch her flesh turn into steel
I'm seeing red and the stage is like a killing field
She got my eyes so tight I can't open 'em
No matter how hard I try I can't focus 'em
Dangerous rhymes, minds I'll be blowing 'em
Far from addictive, ghetto version of opium
All my friends as well as my fans
Fell in love and gave Suzi total command
I tracked her down, I used an intelligent plan
That's why I keep my face hidden like the elephant man
I'm telling you damn
Twisted, but even when I'm sober
I hunt Suzi like Sean Connery in Red October
Sad to say this relationship is over (it's over)
'Cause when I found Suzi I had to smoke her

*CHORUS* (repeat twice)
