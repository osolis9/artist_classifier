Wind-Up:Encore
[Verse 1]
if looks could kill i'd be in a danger zone
don't know what i even did wrong
if you don't say then just leave it alone oh
i worked my hardest tryna get you to talk
you don't seem interested at all
actin' like its all my fault

[Pre]
i'm not feelin' this
tell me what the deal here is
is it worth all the silence, that ish i don't buy it
tell me where we go from here

[Chorus]
girl is this a wind up wind up
you need to make your mind up mind up
should i stay should i go
i really don't know x2

[Verse 2]
I put my hand out hoping that you wanna resolve
throw the towel in and end the remarks
so we can come together as one.one
just when i think you're giving me a second chance
you turn your back and your screwing again
tell me if this will ever end

[Pre]

i'm not feelin' this
tell me what the deal here is
is it worth all the silence, that ish i don't buy it
tell me where we go from here

[Chorus]
girl is this a wind up wind up
you need to make your mind up mind up
should i stay should i go
i really don't know x2

[Rap]
your the ache in my brain
playing them games
am i to blame for your insecure ways
you can stay quiet and keep pushing up your face like you don't want to hear what a brother has got
to say
ive been here, seen it before
why you want to act like theres something wrong
why don't you say whats really going on
your like a rose from a concrete i'm cut from your thorn (This love is so bittersweet, bittersweet)
one minute this, next minute ache
one minute love, next minute hate
cant really see why i stand in this place
yo its getting long, yo i'm heading home
you really do know how to get me out my zone
you used to be the one i can say was my dream
but everything you wish for ain't what it seems

[Chorus out]
