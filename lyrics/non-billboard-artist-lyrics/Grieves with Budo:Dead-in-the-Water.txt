Dead-in-the-Water:Grieves with Budo
What did you want from me?
Ya knockin on doors tryna wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You wanna settle the score, you wanna level the board,
you wanna level me down
What did you want from me?
Ya knockin on doors tryna wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You wanna settle the score, you wanna level the board,
you wanna level me down
I find it funny how ya heart don't work
And that tattooed diamond on ya chest spells hurt... how predictable
Just another shark in the blood stream
Swimmin its way upstream,
and figure out where love sleeps,
And kill it like it must be stopped
I don't see the reason in ya logic I just understand the plot
And if I don't find it outta here I swear to God I'll pop --
From the needles you been stickin in me
Tryna throw me off when I fly straight
Just another meal for the vultures, picked into pieces
and buried under the boulders
Till the last cracked molar is found
I'm just a victim with the soul torn out of him and shot to the ground
Without the glory, broken and that's the way that you like it
With the war horns fired up stimulating excitement and,
I can see why the devil put you in ranks but shoulda
asked you what you wanted fore you flashed me the fangs...
you gotta problem
What did you want from me?
Ya knockin on doors tryna wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You wanna settle the score, you wanna level the board,
you wanna level me down
What did you want from me?

Ya knockin on doors tryna wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You wanna settle the score, you wanna level the board,
you wanna level me down
I've been livin in this winter you provided me
Eatin all the pages of this history inside of me... for what?
Just so you can run around the graveyard and scream
into the Heavens and sink the boat that you came on?
I've taken all the pain I can
And plan on jumpin off this ship before I lose it
and never know who I am
Fore this vessel ever gets in sight of land
Imma dive into the waters underneath it and
take my chances at hand, till it drowns out
You've got a perfect way of killin me
An angel in appearance wit a smile like a guillotine
And I don't think that you could ever change
Pain is your nicotine and fightin me's the flame and it stays that way
Cause everything is frozen in ya steps
And this blade is a trophy to your unexpected guests... you're a monster
And I can smell it rottin in your teeth
Just hope that you can figure out whatchu been lookin for and leave
...you got a problem
What did you want from me?
Ya knockin on doors tryna wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You wanna settle the score, you wanna level the board,
you wanna level me down
What did you want from me?
Ya knockin on doors tryna wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You wanna settle the score, you wanna level the board,
you wanna level me down
