Get-Away:Akir
Yo 
Put on my work clothes 
Late leaving out 
Rush hour for an hour started feakin out 
Manager callin me tryin to stress his authority 
Work tasks the staff does the majority 
Horribly they’re extortin me 
Want the American pie 
But they can’t afford a piece hungry I hit the store to eat 
Thirty minute break 
And two fifteen’s 
A protein shake 
burger with extra cheese 
How much can I take 
I have big dreams I can no longer fake 
Living beyond my means 
That means I need change 
To make my dollars stack 
the years increase my age I can’t get it back 
Matter of fact I’m bout to start tearing down displays 
Flip off the boss and then mush him right in the face 
Tell him that I quit 
demand he send my pay 
Shoutout the homies tell them that I gotta getaway 

All this stress just won’t go away 
My boss keep trippin I been working all day 
The weekends here I just got paid 
A full tank of gas and I wanna getaway 
Getaway Get Get Getaway (3x) 

Collectors on my phone 
Wanna be left alone 
Another Friday watchin Friday think I'll stay at home 
Right when I’m in my zone 
I get a text b 
From this girl that I met so sexy 
She said what up AK think bout you a lot 
It’s Friday night me and my home girls hittin the spot 
I’m like let’s do it then 
But then Im blue again 
I got a letter from unemployment its soon to end 
I gotta pay these bills 
I gotta pay my rent 
I really wanna chill but if my money’s spent 
I can’t eat can’t sleep can’t function right 
How to resolve all these problems got me up at night 
Today’s a new day 
And my future’s bright 
Thinkin of new ways to get my money tight 
That’s when my man called 
and said my bad dog 
Forgot to pay you back when can I hand this cash off 

All this stress just won’t go away 
My boss keep trippin I been working all day 
The weekends here I just got paid 
A full tank of gas and I wanna getaway
