Gettin-Funky-In-The-Joint:Mellow Man Ace
Say, muthafucka, what you mean
You ain't gon' let me in this funky joint?

My homie Snoop Lover's on the drum, the drum
My homie Snoop Lover's on the drum, drum, drum
My homie Snoop Lover's on the diddy drum, drum
Me, I'm Mellow Man, I'm on the mic, so here I come

The M-E-double L-O-W M-A-N A-C-E
Rope-a-dope and definitely in the place to be
Came to tear it up and now I put you in the wrong mode
I deliver lyrics for the SP's in song mode

You can't delete it, rappers can't beat it
It's just like crack, when you start you need it
So light me up right, go 'head, take a puff
Sho nuff, you love that Mellow Man stuff

So you come back for more, eh, wantin' to score, eh
Rewound tapes of funky joints, you can't ignore, ya
Mellow joint fiend, jockin' me blindly
Go to ten stores but you just can't find me

'Cause I sold out, that's without a doubt
'Cause that's what makin' money is all about
So I'm sorry, soft sport, you come up short
'Cause you ain't got the money to pay for rhymes of this sort

Every day you come up shorter with a dollar and a quarter
I should smack you right now, that's what I oughta do
'Cause I don't play, I just get straight to the point
Mellow Man is in the house gettin' funky in the joint

(Say, muthafucka, say, muthafucka)
Say, muthafucka what you mean
You ain't gon' let me in this funky joint?

Now I'm not the kid you wanna go with, know it
Good and well that I'm the bilingual poet
I smoke impostors and crews, the tribe's in a gangsta bang
'Cause it ain't nothin' but a thang

I come off like niggas, never pull triggers
Never live foul but to girls I send shivers
So the day I die on my tomb it'll say
He smoked muthafuckas and got pussy all day

So watch me flow, girls and come a little harder
Girls call me papi, the daddy, the father
But I'm just an outgoing kid that be flowing
Over my mouth and drop rhymes without knowing

So I suggest you back up, go get your backup
Of 10 or 12 rappers that I'ma cold smack up
One by one 'cause ain't a damn thing changed
And seein' me enforce is like watchin' L.A. Gangs

So check me out, hey, you just got done
By the Babalu Boy droppin' lyrics on the one
I won't bullshit, I just get straight to the point
Mellow Man is in the house, y'all, gettin' funky in the joint

We're gettin' funky, this is the funky beat
Funky, get funky

Yo, I'm smooth with my flow and you can bet a smooth talker
Never know what I'll hit next like
(Name)
Or strawberry hittin' a off-speed pitch
Your girl, she's a schemer, so I say
(What up, bitch?)

And you don't even run up or try
To get some of this milky vocal-dropper, dope son of a gun
Mellow Man is in the house, y'all work it out
'Cause that's what throwin' joints is all about

I come ready, steady, ready
(What?)
To cut you up like Freddy
(Who?)
Krueger and wild up like Crazy Eddie

(With what?)
With crazy vocab
(And)
Dope gift of gab
(What?)
Stupid bilingual, wrote rhymes by the pad

So watch me drop ya, ugh, got to stay hyper
The man on the mic servin' you type of hype
That slams on time to basslines
But back up off me, nigga, let the mastermind rhyme

I won't bullshit, I just get straight to the point
Mellow's in the house, gettin' funky in the joint

(Say, muthafucka, say, muthafucka)
Say, muthafucka, what you mean
You ain't gon' let me in this funky joint?
Much money I done spent in here
Nigga, I knew your mama when she was hoein
