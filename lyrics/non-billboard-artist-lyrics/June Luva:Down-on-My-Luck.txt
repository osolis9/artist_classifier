Down-on-My-Luck:June Luva
[June Luva]
20/20/25 thousand in my pocket, it's a good day
Strolling down the FDR again, for some good yae
Check this cat Felipe, Mike G. knew the cat
Said he wanna link up where the Magic Johnson Movie at
Saw this bad chick, she was thick, had a doobie wrap
Outfit was slick, ankle bracelet where her shoes be at
Order from the food snack, me and Mike both strapped
Looking at my Gucci, wondering if this is where it's at
Next thing you know, Felipe and his mans walked in
Bossy type, waving his hands when he's talking
Shit goes wrong, I'mma lay him in his coffin
Why the fuck you wanted me just here, this is ackward
Walked pass the ushers, we ain't going out like no suckas
We down to blaze the place, if they rush us
Head to the back row, shit look cool where we at though
Why it seem like time moving mad slow
Coming attractions on the screen, lights dim low
Whatever games is being played, I'm bound to win, yo
Sped up the tempo, show 'em the money, where my shit at
The scene's about to get action pid-acked
Word...

[Interlude: June Luva]
During the chorus break
Felipe and his mans died, yo
Calogero press rewind, yo
Aiyo, papi, man, I'm saying
I appreciate you wanna spend time wit me and shit
This ain't getting it man
I'm saying you got the product or what, man?
I told you I want my shit
(Relax I got the product)
Relax? Yo fuck that shit
Get your fucking hands off me
Give me that, what, what, hold that down

Yo, at this point, the crowd was bugging, people was running
And ducking, my adrenaline rushing from all them slugs busting
Smoke in the air, hoes in the chair
Colder in the stairs, screaming ass hoes everywhere
This is so clear, I should of peeped it from the door
Cuz that could of been me and my man laying on the floor
I just came for the broad, I could never be a sweet dick
Mike G. hitting at police, I can't believe this shit
I caught a bullet in my thigh, I started bleeding quick
I used my man as a crutch, we bout to flee this bitch
Bust out the back accident, ran through a parking lot
Hot wired the car, about to give it all we got
It sucks to be shot, I'm leaking all over
My body temperature's dropping, son, I'm getting colder
My man look and put his hands on my shoulder
And said that only the strong survive, I am a soldier
Looked out the back window, police is gaining on us
I started busting, they was dipping, changing lanes on us
This was the moment I feared, the tires blew out
We spun, check the clip, no more ammo in the gun
It's a wrap
