PSA-We-Talk:Salt 'n' Pepa
Well, for a long time, me, Pep, and Spinhave been involved in the fight against AIDS, and we always say the best cureis not to get it and not to spread it.
You should be responsible if you're gonna have sex.
So, we decided to give a spoton our album to a group of young peoplewho are also involved in the fight, and they're called WEATOC from Boston, Massachusetts.
They're just young people schoolin' other young people.

[Cathy]
Mario, this is more important than the game.
[Mario]

[Cathy]
There's nobody home right now.
[Mario]
Oh, then so that's why you called me over here then...
[Cathy]
Mario, that's how we got into this in the first place.
[Mario]
What are you talking about? What, what are you talking about?
[Cathy]
I went to the clinic today.
[Mario]
Oh, what you got? A little cold? I know how to fix that.
[Cathy]
Mario, I don't have a cold.
