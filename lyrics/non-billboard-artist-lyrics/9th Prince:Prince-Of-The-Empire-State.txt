Prince-Of-The-Empire-State:9th Prince
[Intro: 9th Prince]
Aiyo, one-two, True Master on the beat

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, my legacy is here forever, always thinking clever
Plus tomorrow be better, smooth like Mayweather
The Prince of the Empire State, holding cake like it's my wedding
Rocking that Killarmy, we the last armageddon
I'm from an era of Wu-Tang and Nas, Death Row and Bad Boy
Giving jobs to the umeployed, seek and destroy
And still live a life of joy
But back to the verbally sniper, shooting down biters
When I'm high, stay fly like skydivers, hover my ears around cadavers
Walk with a sabretooth tiger, I belong, to an organization of dart writers
Critics wanna hear me rhyme like I lost my mind
Like Spider-Man to the top I climb, no more life of crime
Only champagne bottles, tall models
We wine and dine but still on the grind
Yeah, the 9th Prince, One Man Army

[Hook: 9th Prince]
True Master on the beat, rhyme grain, the concrete
We need this in the streets for the Lex, Beemers and Jeeps

[9th Prince]
Yo, so many stormy days so I smoke the haze
And stay John Blazed, through the dark age we on a rampage
Telepathic ways, I glaze when the sun blaze
Martial Law breaker, shout out to Heaven Razah
Get well, you'll be home, Killarmy and Sunz of Man, we the Killarmy Platoon
Kidnap your goons and play a game of torture in a dark room
Niggas is screaming and letting out demons
Like Rakim for a microphone, I'm still fiending
Wake the fuck up or get broke the fuck up
You still dreaming, what is the meaning of life, can you live?
If you get struck in the heart with a sharp knife
Is she your, whore or wife, swim through darkness to get to the light
Twenty seven diamonds in my mic
For every MC, I took off the earth, now they in the dirt
Bullets went through my shirt but didn't hurt
Sometimes with death I flirt, Star Trek trilogy
Like Star Wars, I be moving through your galaxy
Relax it's me, 9th Prince and the Killarmy adversary, we ready to bury

[Hook 2X]
