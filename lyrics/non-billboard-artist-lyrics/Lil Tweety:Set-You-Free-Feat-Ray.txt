Set-You-Free-Feat-Ray:Lil Tweety
you see I tried to be the best I can
tried to be the only man, that would set you free from every tear and misery
but it just came to me all the truth you always hide and it just came to be a memory you hid inside
see I tried to make you happy tried to fill your soul with pride
but it just didn't work it was the first time that you lied
every night I made you cry cuz I was angry up inside
blood rushing through my veins right there I knew I had to change
cuz I couldn't stay the same made me someone who I'm not now it came a part of me but I just want it all to stop
so I hated just for you and I noticed that you changed like a stranger to me
sometimes I think that your a danger to me
If you don't want me then I will set you free I will set you free and you will see life could be without me x2
but don't get me wrong cuz baby I still love you
you just be strong and how I think of you
