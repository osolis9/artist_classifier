There-Is-Rock-N-Roll:Sandman
You show us all the things you got
All the boring things that you brought
You were our friend
Now it has gone to the end
All the things you said
Are making noise sin my head
You don't have to care about me
Just leave me be

Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll
Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll
Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll
Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll

You show us all the things you got
And you know that's quite a lot
We never wanted you to be near
No one actually wanted you here
I thought you were great for a while
But then I noticed that I don't like your style
You're making your own show
You better let it go

Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll
Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll
Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll
Go to the next room open the door
There is Rock n' Roll
