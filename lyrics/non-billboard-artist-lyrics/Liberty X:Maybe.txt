Maybe:Liberty X
Walking all the days of my life
I must have passed you by
A thousand times
Talking 'til the dawn breaks the night
With so many friends by my side
But I've never felt so alone

'Cause I was waiting for a sign
For my destination
When I saw you go the other way
But I gotta keep on going
'Til I find my way home
Maybe we'll meet another day

I'm taking all that I can carry
But I don't know how much I can bear, no, no
I heard there's so much more, waiting for me
Somewhere out there, somewhere, somewhere

But I'm still waiting for a sign
For my destination
I know you've gone the other way, no, no no
But I'm gonna keep on going
'Til I find my way home
And maybe we'll meet another day

Maybe there's a heaven up above
And a devil down below
And a story in the stars
And an angel for me

But I'm still waiting for a sign
For my destination
But I know you've gone the other way, oh
But I'm gonna keep on going
'Til I find my way home
Maybe we'll meet another day
