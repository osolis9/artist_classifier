Make-or-Break:Bugzy Malone
To be the best at what he do
He just kept kickin' and kickin' and kickin' until the bag wouldn't move
Until his shins were numb
He just kept powerin' through
He wants to look after his mum
Somethin' his dad couldn't do
He used to train out in the park
In the blistering cold
Until the roads went dark and the streetlights gave you that orange glow
He would keep kickin' but he would get kicked back 'til he had a broken nose
It could've been boxing, could've been wrestling, it could've been taekwondo didn't matter he was there 6 days a week
Same gym bag same trainers on his feet
Worked on the door so he could eat
Trained hard cause he didn't wanna taste defeat
But sometimes you have to lose and learn before you become the man to beat
And the night that his mum stood next to the cage to support him it was just clear to see
She kept payin' and payin' and payin' for sessions and all of em paid off
Cause now when he kicks, he doesn't feel pain and he could take somebodies face off
He won in the second round but by then his mum would just ruin the make-up
He made thirteen grand and dropped it all on his mother's table

Life is only what you make of it
We are born alone and time begins to tick
I pray you....
I pray you never let it break you
Hey hey
Life is only what you make of it
We are born alone and time begins to tick
I pray you....
I pray you never let it break you

To fail and know it's too late
There was three of em all of em cousins and they would play on the estate
They didn't get along with the other kids
So they would get into fights
But the oldest cousin felt like he had to make sure they were nice
So he started... fightin', fightin', always fightin' just to protect
He put himself in a position where nobody liked him
He got arrested for the last time
Say good night to the bad guy
Only sixteen lookin' at eighteen months and at least he'll do nine
And this meant the younger cousins were left on the street to fend for themselves
And now the protection's gone for the oldest out of the two it was hell
And now he's just.. fightin', fightin' always fightin'
But he's not originally from this country so he's on his final warning
He got deported back to his hometown where the older cousin was holed now
Feelin' guilty his younger got sent home so he's ringin' his mobile phone now
He didn't answer, and when he went on his facebook, it just said R.I.P
The reason I know this story is because the oldest cousin in this was me
