U-R:SZA
Clarity is a state of mind
Freedom ain't real, who's sold you that lie?
I ain't buying that
No matter what the price (one more time? Aight)
So give it up give it up mama
Undo your pants and your bra
I see you liking that, you must need a slice...

Type B personality
Extrovert, introvert, commonalities
A Type A personality
Just dumb enough to lie to me

Ain't you tired of that wind in your face?
Your skin taste likes brussel sprouts I swear
Can't seem to remember your face
So give it up give it up papa
Make it make sense to me
I can not go any further then 2 steps in-front of me
I'm lost in...
