Nikehead:Lexicon
And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
Lexicon! Lace up your sneakers
And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
Nick Fury, lace up your sneakers
And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
Lace up your sneakers
Comin' out your speakers

Everybody's got an addiction, mine is shoes
It started with my very first pair of Kangaroos
And to L it see, made for tennis, I play none of it
But I owned 'em in brown and black suede

But that was hardly the beginnin, of my obscene spendin', nah
Savin' up pennies, parental begging, what?
Even now if I only got forty bills
I'ma buy a sack of weed and go straight to Marshall's

'Cause one time at Ross I found Nike zoom airs
Fourteen bucks, what? I bought two pair
I always do dat dere so there's no need to despair
If my kicks get ugly from some wear and tear

I know it's sick, my addiction, I'm addicted, I admit it
Like an alkie to his liquid, I ain't tryin' to kick it
I predicted, I'm headed only downhill from here
'Cause my foot hasn't grown in the past five years

I got old shoes, new shoes, on my closet floor
In my trunk, holdin' open my doors where?
Overdue shoes, borrowed from my brother, yup
Alternates, duplicates, hard to find colors, check it

I got four pairs of Air Force Ones high and low
All in all white, one with a gum sole
Buyin' Air Max Runners since they first came
Before wearin' neon colors was a G thang

Remember the first ones in pink, makin' eyes blink
All my clothes drab except the kicks that I drag
And my top five fades all got, orange on 'em
From old Air [unverified] to the new Airmada

Lava Domes, check, internationalist, check
And a bag of ankle socks, do you accept checks?
No not for you Mr. Fury, not at sporty L.A.
Your account's made of rubber find another way to pay

That's when I go on the internet to the Japanese sites
Where I can't read a word of it but the pictures taunt
Tell me to max out my Master card
Deal with it later these shoes are hard

Said the same thing for my Wallabees, Timberlands, shit
I even got Cortez to match my Pendletons
I got a problem, and I need salvation
So at this time I'm accepting donations

Cash is fine, or anything in size nine
But please don't send no Jordans
Send 'em to someone else, I'm not the only, one on this earth
Who will buy food second but a pair of shoes first

Oak's a Nikehead, yo and my man Double-O
Whose got more Air Force Ones than anyone I know
I mean, I even got my girl into obscure kicks
If it ain't in my size then a boy size six
So if you wonder, why I'm broke, why?
Or my bank account's dead, A, I'm underground, B, I'm a Nikehead

And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
I'm an addict for sneakers
And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
I'm an addict for sneakers
And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
I'm an addict for sneakers
I'm an addict for sneakers

And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
I'm an addict for sneakers
And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
I'm an addict for sneakers
And I'm a Nikehead, Nas
I'm an addict for sneakers
I'm an addict for sneakers

So when your girl gets bent 'cause you spent the rent
And I'm a Nikehead, and I'm a Nikehead
And your dad gets mad cause it's just a fad
And I'm a Nikehead, and I'm a Nikehead

And your folks complain, say they all look the same
And I'm a Nikehead, and I'm a Nikehead
Well lace up your sneakers, I'm comin' out your speakers
And I'm a Nikehead, and I'm a Nikehead
