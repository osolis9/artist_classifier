[Verse I]
Do you remember how he walked
Onto the stage like the world was ending
And this was his final song?
The way the sweat dripped off his nose
Forming a swirly pool of colors
On the cracked wooden club floor?
Now I recall the way he moved
Back then before the bullet
Shattered pieces of his skull
Spreading him all over the carpet
In that hotel room
They couldn't piece him back together
To sing his last tune

[Hook]
We only wanted one last song
A tune so we could sing along
We only wanted one last song
A tune so we could sing along

[Verse II]
No time machine exists quite yet
And all those voices we once worshiped
Solely belong to the dead
Sleeping so comfortably for now
Between some gatefold sleeves and shrink wrap
Piled on record store grounds
We all imagined his last song
A melody
To help us forget that our God was gone
To help us remember his face
Before the maggots crawled
Inside and out of his eye sockets
Such a perfect song

[Bridge]
Ahhh ahhh ahhh men
Yadi yadi yadi yay
Gummy gummy gum drops

[Verse III]
But he's gone
Into the abyss
Falling fast
Sucked through a giant black hole
Deep into the center of the earth
Far from anybody's ears
Just flung
Into oblivion
Forgotten by the world
And the puppeteers
That once put him on a pedestal
Are repackaging
Hoping advances reappear
Gone
Now there's no way that we could ever
Dig him out beneath the
Mountains of records
That cover his dusty grave
He's done
And there's no Ã¼bermensch
To soothe the senses
Truth is that we'll lose in the end
Everything dies soon
It's helpless

[Hook]

[Outro]
So you have you heard the one about the one man band?
The one man band
Yes, the one man band
