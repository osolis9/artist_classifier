Counting-Stars-Original-Version-:Cyr
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be, counting stars

I see this life I could swing in wan
Swing my heart across the line
in my face is flashing science
Seek it out and you shall find
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be, counting stars

I feel your love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be, counting stars

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt

Everything that kills me makes feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be, counting stars
