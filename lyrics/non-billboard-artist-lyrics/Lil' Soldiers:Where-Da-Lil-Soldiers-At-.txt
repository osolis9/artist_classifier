Where-Da-Lil-Soldiers-At-:Lil' Soldiers
[Chorus]
Where they at
Right there
Watch it
There they go
Where the little little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Were they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
[Little Soldiers]
I'm the I in the alphabet
In no tracks
I'm the t in too cool
Chilli'n like that
I'm the gravy on your mash potatoes
Thinki'n you beef
Like your piggy bank
And penny when your broke on the street
I'm that class in school
That you go to
Like your favorite charter
When you watch cartoons
I'm that cat in the third grade
Talki'n to babes
I'm that last Little Debby
That you here to save
The television show
That you don't want to miss
That rap that you spit
When you talki'n to chicks
I'm your favorite little snack
After taken a nap
I'm the qualified eight year old
With the dangerous rap
[Chorus]
Where they at
Right there
Watch it
There they go
Where the little little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Were they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
[Little Soldiers]
We the s up in serious
Real with this
Were the number pointing out
When you ball you fist
We the cracker on the brisk
That be hurting you feet
We the little unit
Down with Master P
We the power from the paradise
Put on a map
We the best the ever done it
Hot boys on rap
We that a on that paper
When you getin that grade
We the u in the tank
With the hidden grenade
We the speed
When you got to catch the ice cream truck
We that block that you live on
Always ruff
We the key to the hand cuffs
Braking the lox
Wearing tanks on the necks
Cause can't be stopped
[Chorus]
Where they at
Right there
Watch it
There they go
Where the little little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Were they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
[Little Soldiers]
I'm the rope in the gym
That you want to climb on
I'm the rhyme you always singing
Now you call me the bomb
I'm the s in the place
All up in your face
I'm the triable and the bass
Equalizing your taste
I'm the cd in the store
That you about to go get
Like a real low price
For a nice out-fit
Like the iefey eves icy
Open your eyes
Like a juicy cheese burger
With fresh out fries
I'm the lunch ticket call
With the not to glalley
The youngest
Ripping mics
Now holding us down
Like a nice piece of change
When you go out of town
We the punches with the round wit
At lest by the pound
I'm the little soldier
Blacking on every song
I'm the one with the twist
And the hearing bran
I'm a swing in the park
When you you come with your pops
I'm from quom
The bomb
My whole album is hot
[Chorus]
Where they at
Right there
Watch it
There they go
Where the little little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Were they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
Where the little soldiers at
Over there
Watch it
There they go
Where they at
Over there
Watch it
[Little Soldiers]
