Melting:Kali Uchis
you are my church, you are my place of worship
i heard you're the plug, can I be the circuit?
when I got court, I hope that you're the verdict
when you're around, my insides turn inverted
my blood start to rush when I see you, darling
i know you're nearby and I know your purpose
take one look at you, you're heavens incarnate
what is this spell baby, please show some mercy

melting like an ice cream
when you smile
melting, you're a daydream
stay a while

i pray that I can learn to be funny
I am watching every stand-up comedy
just hoping that it will rub off on me
so you will smile at everything I say
you got some soft lips and some pearly whites
I wanna touch them with the dead of night
your smile ignites just like a candlelight
then somehow I know everything's alright

melting like an ice cream
when you smile
melting, you're a daydream
stay...
melting
