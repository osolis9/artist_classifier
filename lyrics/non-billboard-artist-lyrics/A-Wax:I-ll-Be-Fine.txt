I-ll-Be-Fine:A-Wax
I'm having arguments alone
So I must be outta my mind
She said I'm so worried bout you,
Trust me
I'll be fine
Trust
Me
Ill be fine
Disscusion with my mind

Where the hell did it go

Fucks me up in my brain
I'm must be losing it
I must be losing
What the

Ppl think I sent someone
Intense summer
Every year I face fear
Hope you hearing my verses clear

Better hope it don't surface
I'm having arguments alone

I'm must be losing it
I must be losing it
What the fuck is wrong wit my concepts
Coming back from my weed run

It must be gone
