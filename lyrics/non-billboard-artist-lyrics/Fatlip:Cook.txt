Cook:Fatlip
Seen you in the club, doing the rub-a-dub
Looking for some trouble having fun
Laughing, giggling, with your ass wiggling
Thinking to myself, hell yeah she's the one
Young and tender, slender, far from Ugly-
Lovely- female gender
I send ya a drink from across the bar, wink-wink, I'm feeling up to par
So I approach you, like I'm supposed to
Cause you're the type I like to get close to
Go back to my chateaus
For a late night night snack sip a little Merlot
Blackened salmon salad with cro√ªtons
Conversate 'til dawn on a fifty dollar futon
Me and you 'til the sunrise
I'm looking in your eyes, thinking of your thighs

Hey baby do you think maybe
That one day you could be my lady?
You look good, can you cook?
Let me put your number in my phone book

First date, large, it look great
Five star spot, five hundred a plate
Play the role like I'm ballin'
Your body callin'
So I spend a little Cash Money like a nigga from New Orleans
I see you fallin' for the old Fatlip charm
Feelin my arm, checking my strength
Feeling my leg
Checking my length, uh
Hot damn you a dime like one tenth of a dollar
Lookin' like a young Paula Abdul
Fools follow you try to holla, at you
That's you ain't nothing new
Beautiful way back molested at two
But I don't really care about the past
I just want this thing right here to last
I mastered my dick
Don't get enthusiastic
Or blast too quick and bust off too fast

I just want to talk to you right here baby...
What's going on with you...
Naw, I seen, I seen you, I seen you the other night.
You know what I'm saying...
I wanted to, uh, get at you or whatever...
But you know (check it out)...

See I need you
See, see we do
Anything you please
I'll be your Hercules
(Anything you please, I'll be your Hercules)

Please, I ain't too proud to beg
(Please, I ain't too proud to beg)

Sick of tricking dough on hoes spending an arm and a leg
(Sick of tricking dough on hoes spending an arm and a leg)

Drinking all alone nas by the keg

I vaguely recall the last call I received
Or exactly when my last ejaculation was achieved
Without the assist of a hole in my fist
It's almost as if sex doesn't exist
But that's only half of the whole thing
I need a queen to respect the king
Wear my ring, bear my offspring
Bring me meals morning and evening
