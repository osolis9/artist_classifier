Gunna do this for all the girls in love with a thug (now here we go)

Boy I love you
And I neva wanna let u go
I know your thuggin
But I'm feeling on the way you roll
And I'd be nothing without you
Here by my side
Just know I'll always be down

Now shes in love with a hustla
Mama can't stand that
Daddy like damn that
Boy you betta stand back
She tell dem the way she feels
Cry and she say it's real
He don't cause trouble
He just hustle enough to pay the bills
Her friends are saying she'll
Leave but she staying still
See me writing get all excited
Like you gunna get that bills
Yup
She respect me
And she respect herself
And no I only stay staff
And watch my back to protect myself
We tear the cover
Packin pad as we throw the dubba
It's like she wanna
Neva smoke but she wanna roll a blunt up
Then we bump bump
In the sheets
Til we see the sun up
Now you can judge us
We don't care what you thinkin of us
She down to ride
Down to lie
Even die whateva
Leave her for another lady
I could neva(let's go)
She down to ride
Down to lie
Even die whateva
Leave her for another lady
I could neva
This is why

Boy I love you and I neva wanna let you go
I know your thugging
But I'm feeling on the way you roll
And I'd be nothing
Without you here by my side
So I'll always be down

{Look babe I'm gonna be real witcha alright
It's like this look}
I know you need your father
You needa speak to your momma
If I'm the reason for drama
You needa leave
But you wanna
Stay in school but
Listen now baby
Let's go and make the rules
I'm heavy in the street
But not everything that they say is true
Girls are scandolous
When they see you
And tryin to make it through
Brush it off your shoulder
I'm coming home everyday to you
Now if I'm locked up
And gotta go do a stretch in prison
Just promise that you gunna move on
Baby commence to livin
But don't you think
That these feelings have changed
The day I'm free
Hopefully
We can rekinddle the flame
Just hold me
In your memory
And remember the name
She looked at me with a smile dawg
And all she could say was

Boy I love you
And I neva wanna let you go
I know your thuggin
But I'm feelin on the way you roll
And I'd be nothin without you
Here by my side
Just know I'll always be down

She from the s'burb
I just bring her round the hood
Cause she know when she with me
It's all good(good)
You doin what you gotta do
Nothin wrong with that boy
You know I got your back
And that's a fact boy

So let's ride together
Bride together
And know I'm staying by your side foreva
So let's ride together
Grind together
And know I'm staying by your side foreva

She said she'll always be down
