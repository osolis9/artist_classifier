One-Woman-Army-Intro:Ciara
Never knew what I was signing up for
Knew it was hard but not this hardcore
Never gonna stop, never gonna give up on you
No matter what I do

Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
I'd fight for you, I'll die, I'll be your protector
Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
No matter what may come, I won't surrender

Wanna give you everything I never had
Love you and teach you good from bad
Never gonna stop, never gonna give up on you
No matter what I do

Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
I'd fight for you, I'll die, I'll be your protector
Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
No matter what may come, I won't surrender

What I do, I do for you the best I can
Build a life for you with my own two hands
Never gonna stop, never gonna give up on you
No matter what I do

Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
I'd fight for you, I'll die, I'll be your protector
Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
No matter what may come, I won't surrender

Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
I'd fight for you, I'll die, I'll be your protector
Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
No matter what may come, I won't surrender

Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
I'd fight for you, I'll die, I'll be your protector
Here I am baby, I'm your one woman army
No matter what may come, I won't surrender
