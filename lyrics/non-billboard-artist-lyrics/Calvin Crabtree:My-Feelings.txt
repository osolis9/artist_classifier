My-Feelings:Calvin Crabtree
You where the one talking about thug for life*
Now you sitting at home with ya kids and ya wife
I'm still keeping it g
Introduced me to the life of crime now you asking what the fuck is wrong with me
Saying the shot needs to stop you sounding like ya pops when we'd get suited and booted
With the bandannas ready to do it
13 and shit a young bad ass commiting the crime and screaming prove it with the blunt in my hand
Feeling invensable just picking up that glock and poping off them shots
Drinking till we sober and talkimng about how we wanted to go out when we died
Couse I know deep down in they hearts they knew I would be the on who keep it alive
Couse it made me feel alive to have that thugging felling inside
When from school text books to pulling out techs to thoe who gave dirty looks and getting fucked up
And beating those up who wasent down on my block
Parranoid of the law if they chase me I won't stop I know I'm wrong in life and I skeem to get buy
You got me in to this and now I don't know why

You lost that thugging feeling, ooo o that thugging felling, you lost that thugging feeling now it gone, gone, gone, wooo ooo o ooo ooo [x2]

I took you in gave you close and half my meals
Growing up sed wed be down for life just showing you I was real
Showed me the ropes when I was young made me feel thuff
Now you haveing tuff times so I healped you felt it was my duty
But look now how you do me stealing my shit to trade it to get your fix
You probly even pulled some trick sucking a mans dick to hit that glass dick that's some shit
What was once my role model and close hommie I'm wanting them to be a stranger so in the futcher he don't know me
So lonly so confuse no where to turn to
This life style is so fucked up got me fucked up whered I go wrong, my life,
Or was it my foult I thought it would be something that wuld make me feel proud thinking about all the stuff now I'm haveing doughts I'm over

It I just want yout, so what are my hommies saying now?

You lost that thugging feeling, ooo o that thugging felling, you lost that thugging feeling now it gone, gone, gone, wooo ooo o ooo ooo [x3]
