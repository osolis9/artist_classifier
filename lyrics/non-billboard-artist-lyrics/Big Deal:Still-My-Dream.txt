Still-My-Dream:Big Deal
[Verse 1]
All the junk that keeps you so distant
I can hardly see you through
This stuff that takes you so far from
What you want and what you do
Oh, your name
Ringing in my ears
But it never sounds the same
Under the moon you reflected
All the words we couldnâ€™t say

[Chorus]
I shut them out to see your face
But somethings always in the way
But you are still my dream
Oh, you are still my dream
[Verse 2]
Does it feel just like you remember
Does the magic still remain?
The wind is changing direction
And the music dies again

[Chorus]
I shut them out to see your face
But somethings always in the way
You are still my dream
Oh, you are still my dream
I shut them out to see your face
But somethings always in the way
You are still my dream
Oh, you are still my dream
You are still my dream
Oh, you are still my dream
You are still my dream
Oh, you are still my dream
You are still my dream
Oh, you are still my dream
