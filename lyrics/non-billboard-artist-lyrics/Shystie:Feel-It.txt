Feel-It:Shystie
Ahhhh I'm itty bitty
Got a couple dargs chasing after the kitty
How you gonna blame them, babes I'm pretty
It's bait, ya man wanna squeeze pon my tittys
Woof woof, dogs are what men are
He see me in my wife beater, no Stella
Bitch I'm a pirate, plank on ya fella
Now he wana make it rain, let me get my umbrella
Lard, let the lights dim
You know what it is, show me skin, let's sin
White cup, swag juice, filled right to the brim
Bitch I'm so waved, gonna drown, can't swim
Breakfast in bed with some head
Never fuck with you if you niggas ain't cleared
Son, nothing in life's to be feared
Let me put it in ya face, get it all on ya beard

Tell 'em all move, get up, get up out my way
Tell 'em all move, get up, get up out my way
Tell 'em all move, get up out my way
Tell 'em all move move move move move

Ahhh, you know what this is
Don't act like you don't know this is
Look I am the shit, bitch come take whiff
Phone line popping like I move sniff
Fuck them gal, I be swagging
I can have there whole fucking team white flagging
Boyfriends me and these gal wan tag in
Everybody know seh dat mi have the fire like a dragon
Ride out for my whole team like I'm killing
Fuck good girls, I'ma bad gyal villain
Wan test I, better pray God willing
I'ma boss and I will start Meek Milling
Minor, ya know say mi big and major
Bummy ass guys, they ain't on my radar
Headtop with a laser
Never spilt with my team, Dappy Fazer
