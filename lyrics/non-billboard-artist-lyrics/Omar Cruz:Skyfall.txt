Skyfall:Omar Cruz
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the skyfall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall, at skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall, at skyfall

Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

-Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall-

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the skyfall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

Let the skyfall
We will stand tall
At skyfall
