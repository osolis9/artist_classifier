Purple-Heart:Sevin
Yeah
You can't really know who you are
Until you know who's you are, uh
You feel me? Yeah
For real
Purple blood in these veins boy
Forever mob'n yeah c'mon

For real
So deservin' to Jehovah to throw my soul in hell
They revoked the bail but He broke me outta my lonely cell
And I need Him
Won't know how on my own prevail
Completion
Like a quarter ounce on that tony scale
The evidence of the spirit making His residence in me
Is evident to the people who really know me well
Huh we are active in the street where they are prone to kill
And you you better practice what you preach baby that's show n' tell
Huh if your soul is polluted they could show you the truth
But you would be too slow to compute it
Like them older Dell's
As I bell in the zone where so many homies fell
I'm too trained to stay on track how I'm gon' derail
Huh I came here from the bottom where the cobras dwell
You know my motto - bang a throttle till the motor yell
Ain't a problem that my father doesn't shoulder well
These zag heads will get scrambled before they yoke a shell

For real
Purple heart beatin' in my chest
Ready for the war boy I'm sleeping in my vest, right
I'mma seek Him to my death
Keep leading my steps
Spirit's speakin and it's weakening my flesh
For real
Purple heart beatin' in my chest

Yo…and I climb through with that swine flu bruh
I'm sick of errythang
Spitting scriptures lift you as quick as a spliff of mary jane
I wish I could rip ‘em from e'rry gang
Dude states no fruitcake
The blueberries trippin' with the cherries mane
My environment's wild - was never very tame
But I bear His name in e'rry lane of this harried game
Where we tarry we carry pain
Cuz out here when it's a drought year
They kill Abel… but bury Cain
I shared my gun hand with the killers
They don't feel us cuz these squares is one handed gorillas
They could barely hang
Paul spoke to the Romans and Peter spoke to the Jews
I was a gangster before this I bring the hopeless good news
I've been broke and unnoticed I bring the homeless good shoes
Bruh my people are broken I bring my culture some tools
They think Christianity's just a bunch of rules
Made up by people trying to keep you from what you wanna do
And really freedom in Jesus frees you so you can see what's in front of you
Then you no longer wanna do what you wanted to
Real talk
I used to love to get high nothing but blood in my eye
Swore I would thug till I… die
I was worshipping the serpent then
Filthy at heart guilty as charged bruh the verdict's in
Yeah, then I heard the gospel and got converted when
He inserted in His Holy Spirit bruh and it murdered sin
If you wit' it turn up the furnace then
Committed …Nah we ain't goin out
We going further in
What, you nervous friend
You better pray cuz we roll hard
Got my skull card trying to earn a ten

For real
Purple heart beatin' in my chest
Ready for the war boy I'm sleeping in my vest, right
I'mma seek Him to my death
Keep leading my steps
Spirit's speakin and it's weakening my flesh

Yuh
If you fail to plan you plan to fail baby
Persecution's a guarantee
But so is salvation for those that endure
Hah
Forever mob'n yuh!
