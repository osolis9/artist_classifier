Pain-Interlude-:Trey Songz
Passion....pain....pleasure*

It hurts when I laugh sometimes, feels good when I cry 
Tell me would you look at them 
Can you see the pain in my eye 
As the star shine in the night sky 
As the sunset wabe out the cloud 

As the world spin from time n time again 
Look at myself wondering where I've been 
City to city and girl you are the one that I got to give 
You know me no matter how I am appear
