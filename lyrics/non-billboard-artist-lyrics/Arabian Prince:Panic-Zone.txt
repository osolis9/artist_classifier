Panic-Zone:Arabian Prince
Panic Zone, don't get your girl in here;
A way out in here, a way out in here,
A way out in here, a way out in here,
A way out in here, a way out in here,
A way out in here, a way out in here,
Panic Zone, don't get your girl in here,
Panic Zone, don't get your girl in here,
Panic Zone, don't get your girl.

It's called the Panic Zone (The Panic Zone)
That's right, The Panic Zone
Some people call it torture,
But it's what we call home,
(we are the renegades of this territory
And you're afraid),
I'm the Arabian Prince, (and we're N.W.A.),
Don't interfere with the sound you here,
Cause it's a dangerous groove,
I'm in control of your mind and soul,
Don't be afraid, just bust a move,
So out your home,
You're on your own,
In the land of the unknown,

It's the darkside, the darkside,
It's called The Panic Zone.

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong,
The underworld is taking control,

We're not only in dimension of sight and sound
But of mind,
There's a sign posted up here, and it reads
"The Panic Zone".

Now the party is at its peak,
So we suggest you move your feet,
N.W.A. create the groove,
And Dr. Dre create the beat;
So if you got the juice,
And you're feelin' loose,
Let the music take your mind,
The Prince is here,
Don't interfere, our world is one of a kind;
This place is called the West,
West-Coast of the USA,

The Panic Zone's homebase,
In a place we call L.A;
So ladies, all the ladies,
If you're all alone,

Just call Arabian Prince,
In The Panic Zone (Pa-Pa-Panic Zone).

A way out in here, a way out in here,
A way out in here, a way out in here,
A way out in here, a way out in here,
A way out in here, a way out in here.
