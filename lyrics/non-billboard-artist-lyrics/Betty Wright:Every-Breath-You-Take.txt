Every-Breath-You-Take:Betty Wright
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every little step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Well, every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night but I only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby, please

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me, oh yeah
How my poor heart aches
With every step that you take
Every little, every little step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I will be watching you

Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Said, I will

Huh, just look at you
You thought I didn't see you, huh

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take

Every breath you take
Every breath you take
Every breath you take
