One-Day:Kyprios
One day, Kyprios, one day
Swollen Members, drop it

One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me

Ever wonder how one day it's a blessing, the next, a curse?
What you do in a day affects the whole universe
It's mysterious but here it is, energy swells
From lands full of sands to the liberty bell

From advanced organisms to single cells
From those living in heaven to those dwelling in hell
Yesterday, talkin' yourself, our toll prevail
The power of 24 hours can change and compel

This is crazy, yo, it gets stranger still
One day child is born with a brain to build
One verse at a time, I live mine through music
One day a teacher but always a student, one day

One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me

My days run quicker than am track
Momentum got me movin' so stand back
'Cuz dads back to his bad self, baby
Never let a little stipulation make me crazy

It ain't worth it, interrupt to make it perfect
Built to exact measurements like my verses
It's me versus the world and all its curses
Serpents workin' the evil, I'm not a servant

I'm burdened by the fact, I'm on my own track
Phone back 'cuz I'm busy, I'm really a lone cat
Despite my band, my group, I'm out the loop
Are we superior and ready to count this loot?
Let's go

One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me

One love, one sun
Wonder where your time is goin' when you're under the gun
I got one fight, one breath, I think I'll breathe a little deeper
Till I got out the left, I'm a breath away from death
Every time that I speak, I need to keep my breathing
In tune to what I believe, I take the seasoning, I take the reasoning

With beautiful talk, I am the rock
To knock the thought out your dream box
You see your life, to be yourself in this
Don't forget all of that and get selfish
I'm a gift from the sky, for the myths be I
I ain't missing anything, I'll live it to the day I die

One day I went platinum but that's the trouble with one day
'Cuz the next day I wanna double it, then triple it
I'm sittin' here trippin' wit keepin' this ridiculous predicament
I'm caught in, I wanna take a break but I don't wanna be forgotten

So I'm plottin and scheming wit screaming demons runnin' through my mind
Nightmares and daydreamin', that's how those compare
So now is drunk, talkin' bout the moments worth trashin'
At least I can't remember the shit that was embarrassing
Mood swings, extreme highs and lows
One day we'll see the light but we still got miles to go

One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me
One of these days, you will lift up from me

I'll make you runny, catch me on the runway
Saturday, Sunday, find me in the sun rays
That's all I got to say, sometimes it's funny
That I can feel this way, I'll make it one day, ooh
