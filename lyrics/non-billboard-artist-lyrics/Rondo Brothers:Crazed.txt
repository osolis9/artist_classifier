Crazed:Rondo Brothers
Look how the snow is falling,
it softens every step.
I hear the sirens wailing,
they haven't reached me yet.

And as the body runs,
my conscience stands alone.
Of all the things I've done,
I know this one was wrong.
But if I could bring you back... I would.
They called me crazed.

I feel your heart inside me,
it beats for both of us.
Thank God I took it from the
long life of where it was.

And as the body runs,
my conscience stands alone.
Of all the things I've done,
I know this one was wrong.
And I pushed it by,
it wont lie down.

The light falls on the table
illuminates my soul.
I read fantastic fables
and then I'm free to go.

And as the body runs,
my conscience stands alone.
Of all the things I've done,
I know this one was wrong.
But if I could bring you back... I would.
They call me crazed.

They call me crazed. (3x)

They call me...
