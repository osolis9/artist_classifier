I-Ain-t-No-Rapper:Reef the Lost Cauze
Yeah!*

What up Brods?

From Philly to Norway (nigga, I ain't no rapper...
I ain't no muhfuckin' rapper nigga)

I ain't no rapper!

The equivalent of wickedness, sid vicousness, ridiculous
You die slow while I live for this
Find my arch nemesis quiverin' while I'm in the premises
It's my movie, here's what the premise is
I don't do nothing if I don't really benefit
I cut people off, I don't mean finish sentences
You won't get that until I'm long gone
You gay dancing in Sean John thongs to Sean Paul
Oh lord... here goes that guy again
With the spectacular spit stealing my shine again
You should not try and win, be happy to lose
Lil' BDI dudes looking at my confused... man...
I'll murder your spirit before I consider your flesh
Fucked you up with that right? Now give it a rest
Give up the checks, it's time to pay the piper
Cauze is Johnny Cash going down a reign of fire

[Chorus: x2]
I'm a end up in all y'all top 10
Like G Rap, Big Daddy n Rakim
Biggie & Pac... yo who shot them?
"I don't really give a fuck... I ain't no rapper! "

I blaze trees that harvest in the humble forest
You fall flat like one-note chorus
Hare vs. Tortoise... run nigga run
America said that we like our young niggas dumb
Ahh... it figures... I'm preaching to the Choir
Your tongue needs to be yanked, I'm reaching for the plyers
Been nice since my mom found my reefer in the dryer
I left it in my pocket... was a thief and was a liar
Ain't shit changed except now I don't hide my smoke
Ancestors were tied with ropes inside a boat
So we could have gold fronts and hair salons
I still know where it's not but I don't know where it's gone
Somewhere beyond, I'm tryna rope it in
Go to war against Uncle Sam like the Ho Chi Minh
Before the globe should end and blows away in the coldest wind
I'm a drop jewels just for you to soak'em in

[Chorus x2]

I'm the truest rhymin', rare breed like jewish-irish
Disrespect your argument like Judge Judith Sheindlin
If you said you beat me, then you is lying
Cancer consuming the chords, the music's dying
Do this as a blueprint, exude defiance
Lock your doors, the full moon is rising
The natural should never be confused with science
The power to move the muthafuckin' Mayans
It's not doctorine, it's raw rockin', jaw droppin'
They say Cauze awesome
Potatoe silencer make you au gratin
My words is dirty... all rotten
Covered in filth, your mother's a milf
Get the cream all day son, nothing but milk
I dig in your ass like boxers that's silk
You wanna run with me then your gonna get kill't... oh!
