Smokin-Valves-from-Live-Hot-Curry-And-Wine-LP-:Holocaust
Got me an electric guitar
I'll show you where the good times are
Whip it up... play all day
I don't care what the neighbours say

I love to rock, I love to get down low
I love to rock... rock 'n' roll

Got me some smokin' valves
And you can hear me for a hundred miles
Ten speakers gone in a year
I got a grin from ear to ear

Got no time for women or booze...
I ain't got no time to lose
I got the loudest axe in town...
Look at me, a rock and roll clown
