Iesha-Live-from-In-Living-Color-:Another Bad Creation
Iesha, Iesha
So glad to meet ya
See you in the schoolyard
Strolling with your teacher

The little skirt you
Played was really fly
She turned around and
She winked her eye

So I stepped to her
Like I knew her
The Biv is cool
But Romell is cooler

The bell rang
Cause I started to talk
Yet the class is
Not there no more

Yo, Red, where'd you meet her

At the playground, you know
That's where I saw this cutie
This girl was swinging
And she looked so fly

On the monkey bars
We climbed up to the top
And she touched my hand
That's when I fell in love

Iesha, you are the
Girl that I never had
And I want to get
To know you better

Iesha, you know
I want you so bad and
There's nothing anyone can do
To keep me away from you

Yo, Dallas man
These five young boys
Out of Atlanta, GA
Are a real adventure

They kinda like remind me of
Me and my boys, New Edition
Know what I'm saying

So all you people out there
Riding in your cars
Listening to the radio station
Or cooling back in
Your living room
Watching this here video
Yo, check the second verse

We played Nintendo
This was her very first date
I didn't wanna make it
Seem too fly

We ate cereal
She couldn't stay out at late
Her mother told her
To be home at nine

Iesha, you are the
Girl that I never had
And I want to get
To know you better

Iesha, you know
I want you so bad and
There's nothing anyone can do
To keep me away from you

(Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike)
Chris, Mark, Red, Da, Ro
(Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike)
Chris, Mark, Red, Da, Ro

Yo, Ro, you might
Sound too sure
So whatyou gonna do
I dunno Da, I only
Got one more rap and
I'm gonna see what happens

Threw down my books
Went up to the door
Pressed the bell
What was in store

Iesha came out
With a smile, oh, no
She ain't worth the while

So I passed her a
Lollipop and a letter
Told her so let's
Keep this a secret
Now remember, Iesha
Only you can keep this
