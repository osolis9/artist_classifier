"You know me"

[Verse 1:]
I push black market rhymes in a white collar world
For the opportunity to make a mighty dollar bill
Gotta deal with the real
Reality is a snake that'll strike if you let it sit and rattle in your face
And it's poison
Wake up every night hearin' noises
When the wind blows man I swear I hear voices
Choices, decisions, boys go to prison
Girls havin' babies, people dyin' and we miss 'em
The system, a cycle
The rich get richer
On every corner there's a spot for us to buy liquor
And every mornin' we know we got to make a livin'
So every mornin' we go to work to go get it
The stereotypes you put me in, I don't fit it
Lyrics, dig deeper when you hear them translated
There's more to MCin' than bein' a fan favorite
There's more to MCin' than bein' a fan favorite

[Verse 2:]
You sure you wanna be the rap games greatest rapper?
They murder them
And then you never see the killer captured
My theory on that is, we're too influential 
Politicians don't reach 'em like we do on instrumentals
Imagine if Pac could've endorsed Barrack
Then the lines at polls would have wrapped around the block
If Biggie would have went on tour for Al Gore
Then possibly, there wouldn't be a second Gulf War
So logically
I speak what I feel in my heart
Cause there's a lot of rap fans that are still in the dark
About the ways of the world, the games bein' played
The money we're throwin' away, that ain't bein' saved
I can't be afraid to touch on the hot topics
To win you gotta gamble like playin' the stock market
So when you see me scramblin' like there's no tomorrow
I'm doin' it for my family
Hustlin' for my honor

[Verse 3:]
This is problematic poetry
A symphony of struggle
A masterpiece of melancholy misery and trouble
So open your eyes because the enemies among us
Givin' us record deals like the industry can run us
It's funny
Real MC's police themselves
The same way a street dude will release those shells
From the clip of his whip and if he's threatin' a corner
I apologize Morehouse I left without warning
The same way my mother left Morris
Which is further proof we live in the shadow of those before us
The burden of the past is enormous
Imagine my plight tryin' to write with the legends in the chorus
It's morbid
Watchin' men throw they lives away
Chasin' fortune and fame knowin' their souls can't afford it
Reward it
Not with the glamor and salt
But with relentless criticism till you're just an afterthought
