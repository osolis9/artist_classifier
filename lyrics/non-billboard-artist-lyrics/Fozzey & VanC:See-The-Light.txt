See-The-Light:Fozzey & VanC
(A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them, and now it's left me blind)

Let me paint a picture
But wait it has twist
The razor is my paint brush the canvas is my wrist
And I've been up every night trying to paint the perfect one
Its the only way i deal when the hurting comes
They say ill get better but i feel the same today
Maybe i should be selfish and take the pain away

Nah ive seen so many people go and take there life
And im telling you now that shit doesn't make it right
If your down now im saying keep your head up
Im just like you but probably more head fucked 
Theres been days where if thought to myself this is it
But the last thing i want to be is a hypocrite
Look at me i turned all this into a positive
And you can get through no matter what the problem is
This ones for that kid thats to afraid to speak up
And to the fans that keep telling me they need us
I got you

(chorus)

You see the light, just stick it in
Even if your worlds coming to an end
you'll realise that everything is in the palm of your hands
Just put it down while you think about
Even though you feel the way you're feeling now
The way you're feeling now

Beware of the false man no matter no why
I try to pick up the pieces that are left behind
Everyones watching and no one will save me
Im all alone and know this no one will notice me

(chorus)

You say you want to die, but you just want to be saved
And i hope you hear this before you make that mistake
Theres very little more that i can say now
Just know thats not the only way out 

(chorus)
