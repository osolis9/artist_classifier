Keep-It-Real:Yungstar
You can buy me diamonds
Or lot's of ice
You could buy me a benz
And not ask the Price
Better yours than mine
I won't take a dime
But if it's comming out my pocket every thing is fine
We can spend the cash
And Ill let you flash
I'm too playa for dat there
So you can go ahead and pass
I like shinning too
Even rhyming too
I got other female friends just as fine as you
I do things for you
You do things for me
I'm as real as real get's and it's plain to see
But first time a front
Took you out to lunch
Spent 50 on your food
You aint eat that much
You better ask you friends
I'll smash some twins
I peep game from a distance
Like a contact lenz
So let me swing your wheel
In your red seville
I put food on these tables
You can pay these bills
You triflinnnnn
Hoodrat roaching
Type of sistas
Were T.Y.P
Dem roaching hoes we always miss em'
We ballas
When times get hard
We need a woman to help us out
And never
A girl like you who don't know what a players about

Can you pay my cell phone bill
Put Baggets in my grill
Buy a house on a hill
Then maybe we can chill
If you can't come through
Then you gone get the boot

Hold up
Every thing was gravy
Till you started talking about them dollars
Trying to be another gangsta boo
But, Uh Imma make you holla holla
Like J-rule Imma act a fool
Can't get a dime from oweing me
Better ask my partner
That boy lil Marcus
Can't get that F y b to the e
That's J-five
We struggling to strive
Up in this thing for finner things
Breaking up all these plots and schemes
Can you put a bling bling up in my ring
That's your best friend Im talking Baggets
If you really wanna uh keep it real
Baby I'll drop half on the bills
But you need to chill and keep it real
And that's 50/50 not 80/20
Tryin to stack my paper up real tall and long
Talking down on my name like Jenny jones
Blowing up my phone
Cause Im ridding on chrome
Better leave me alone
And get lil daddy to pay your bills
Cause you don't know nown playa wit my skills
So you better chill and Keep it real

Can you pay my cell phone bill
Put Baggets in my grill
Buy a house on a hill
Then maybe we can chill
If you can't come through
Then you gone get the boot
Can you pay my cell phone bill
Put Baggets in my grill
Buy a house on a hill
Then maybe we can chill
If you can't come through
Then you gone get the boot
Can you pay my cell phone bill
Put Baggets in my grill
Buy a house on a hill
Then maybe we can chill
If you can't come through
Then you gone get the boot
Can you pay my cell phone bill
Put Baggets in my grill
Buy a house on a hill
Then maybe we can chill
If you can't come through
Then you gone get the boot
