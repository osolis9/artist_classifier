Beethoven-s-Cunt:Serj Tankian
Brushing touching feeling on your shoulders
Believing appealing kneeling in your worlds
Oceans are combined

Being that I love you so much
In the end, they all will say
Breaking someone else's heart again

Find the little evil perpetrator
And feed him to the hungry alligator
You want it all
You want it all

Love is not about the profits
Nor the riches in your dreams

The arms of time are breaking off
Civilization is on trial
The clocks eliminating time
Do you believe in me

Well I've been walking through these dead farms
But I don't mind
I've been screaming through these dead lungs
But I can't find

Being that I love you so much
In the end they all will say
Breaking someone else's heart again

Find the little evil perpetrator
And feed him to the hungry alligator
You want it all
You want it all

Love is not about the profits
Nor the riches in your dreams

The arms of time are breaking off
Civilization is on trial
The clocks eliminating time
Do you believe in me

But lately I've been blind
You leave me all alone, left in time
You left me here to die, left in time
You leave me all alone, left in time

The arms of time are breaking off
Civilization is on trial
The clocks eliminating time
Do you believe in nothing

But lately I've been blind
Leave me all alone, left in time
