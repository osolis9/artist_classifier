Like-It-Or-Not:Hell Razah
[** feat. Baghdad, Prodigal Sunn:]


[Movie Sample]
You can't even sit on a beach for 20 minutes*
Without running for cover, without dying from cancer
How the hell you gonna build pyramids?
Don't you realize your foreparents lied to you
Your rabbi's lied to you
That you stoled the land of Israel
Just like you stoled America
Just like you stoled Russia
Just like you stoled the moon

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Whether you +Like It or Not+ [x4]
We gonna go in '99, whether you +Like It or Not+
We gonna go in 2000, whether you +Like It or Not+
Whether you +Like It or Not+
Sunz of Man, stay hot, whether you +Like It or Not+

[Interlude: Baghdad]
All units come, all units come in
The suspect is in sight, do not try to apprehend him alone
He is armed and dangerous, I repeat
He is armed and dangerous

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Brooklyn'll shoot a cop, whether you +Like It or Not+
We put work on ya block, whether you +Like It or Not+
Fortune 5000, whether you +Like It or Not+
We tell the truth to the youth, whether you +Like It or Not+
Ya girl is fuckin' me tonight, whether you +Like It or Not+
Armageddon soon to hit, whether you +Like It or Not+
Armageddon soon to hit, whether you +Like It or Not+
We drop jewels on the regular, whether you +Like It or Not+
What, what, fuck y'all, whether you +Like It or Not+
Fuck what ya niggas think, whether you +Like It or Not+

[Hell Razah]
Fuck 5-0, we hot, while ya Black Tahoe's
Wit wild priminals that'll die for the dough
Nine blows from the guns of these Brooklyn bravo's
Shows how Mexico eatin' taco's
Blowin' hydro rolled up in gold Fronto
My team hittin' hard like we Denver Broncos
Rap Picasso bury niggas in the pothole
Die slow, let 'em bleed to death til' his eyes close
Stop flows like a river dam, up in Amsterdam
Hell Razah, Sun of Man, seen the promissed land
Like the Pope John the Third, it's the Ku Klux Klan
My mind being catscanned, lookin' at ya glance
We see through your evil, if you ain't Hebrew
Women like the way I entice it, so they can tease you
Superstars ain't God, cuz ya niggas bleed too
Never ever bite the hand that extend to feed you
Out the darkness, is my light gonna lead you
You ain't nothin' but a piece of meat I sink my teeth through

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Yeah, yeah, whether you +Like It or Not+
Hell Razah stay hot, whether you +Like It or Not+
We gonna take the Earth back, whether you +Like It or Not+
We get money in the bank, whether you +Like It or Not+
We puttin' records in the store, whether you +Like It or Not+
Absolute all night, whether you +Like It or Not+
Ya girl is fuckin' me tonight, whether you +Like It or Not+
Armageddon soon to hit, whether you +Like It or Not+

[Interlude: Baghdad]
The perpetraitors are sighted on the Brooklyn Bridge
We need a roadblock at the Flatbush extension
The perp has increased his arsenal
So please, proceed wit caution

[Baghdad]
It's signa, signor, Tray Bag, I'm loc'd dolo
From Toronto, I'm a hot jalapeno
Dusty hoes I grip in my Derango
Holy wit my hailo, as my sombrero
Lay low wit the lizards, on camels cross rivers
When the snake quivers, my AK delivers
Senoritas wit margeritas, defeaters and millimeters
Niggas couldn't read us even wit encylopedias
Brooklyn amigos, trees from Montego
+Ghetto Government+, sluggin it from El Dianco

[Prodigal Sunn]
Come meet the young Kamikaze
Watch eighteen slugs bust through ya body
But how you think a Bacardi drinker, stop wit the trigger slinger
Brooklyn brigade, black blaze and bloody days
Strap wit grenade, sluggin' my way through drug raids
I love to get paid, movin' like a shadow in shade
Never affraid, my teammates don't go renegade
It's Sweet Assassin, keep my morals pure, mentally fastered
Everlasted move wit passion, when I'm blastin'
Ready for war, son I gotta settle the score
For better or more, my mom and father granted me strong

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Yeah, yeah, whether you +Like It or Not+
I be wit ghetto +Ghetto Government+, whether you +Like It or Not+
We be them wild criminals, whether you +Like It or Not+
We came to blow up the spot, whether you +Like It or Not+
We goin' plat' underground, whether you +Like It or Not+
Ya girl is fuckin us tonight, whether you +Like It or Not+
Armageddon soon to strike, whether you +Like It or Not+
Absolute all night, whether you +Like It or Not+
Cuz Brooklyn'll shoot a cop, whether you +Like It or Not+
We puttin' workers on the block, whether you +Like It or Not+
Hell Razah stay hot, whether you +Like It or Not+
We puttin' records in the stores, whether you +Like It or Not+
We smoke weed in the cab, whether you +Like It or Not+
We hop the fuckin' turnstyle, whether you +Like It or Not+
We smoke weed in the cab, whether you +Like It or Not+
We gonna hop the turnstyle, whether you +Like It or Not+

[Interlude: Baghdad]
Mayday, mayday
The suspect has formed an alliance wit the +Ghetto Government+
Retreat, I repeat retreat
We are not going, on the nearest hill
We need to back out

[Outro: Hell Razah]
What, what, whether you +Like It or Not+
What, what, whether you +Like It or Not+
Fuck 5-0, whether you +Like It or Not+
Fuck 5-0 (We goin' plat underground), whether you
+Like It or Not+
Whether you +Like It or Not+
Yeah, GG, whether you +Like It or Not+
Hell Razah, whether you +Like It or Not+

Runnin through the streets of Brooklyn, whether you
+Like It or Not+
Untouchable, whether you +Like It or Not+
