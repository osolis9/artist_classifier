U-M-P-:Shy One
In 1983
A prophet was born

Shy One, Shy One

I feel myself growing up
To be nothing
It's like my soul doesn't want
Any part with me
I'm stuck all alone
Thinkin' and I'm talkin' to myself and then I cannot even roam
Without a single thought that then will make me in the spot
Putting light on anything that's wanting me to drop
But I will not let me drop
We will stay at the top
In my mind all confused
I don't know what to do
I will live and soon die
Nobody will cry
Who would know who I am
I am nothing, that's the end
The pressure will sooner
Rise up in the deep, in the parts, in the veins
And that makes me insane, I can't lose control
I am losing my mind and reacting to slow
I'll never get recognized, all that I've done
Just working so hard with no play, no fun
Someone please, open your mind
So you can see my kingdom

All of these questions that haven't been answered
To why am I feeling that loneliness after
The goods that I've done there but then it's not fun
As they're taking advantage and I have to run
My life is a book and it gets a page turn
And you gotta look deep or else you will not learn it
But you were misled and I knew this would happen
So tie me up and let me burn
Maybe this is all that I need and I cannot even make up of the best
And when you put me to the test and when you keep on blinding me
To the point where you can see
I'm a little lost soul, I'm an unborn seed
As the days go by I feel me fly by nights
And I feel all alone and this is how I grow
When I feel my eyes move and look the other way
You can put me down cause I am here to lay
