All-Over-Love-:Eamon
Hard to believe it
It's kind of amazing but it's true
Now that I'm needing
Something so special, here comes you

So how am I crazy
To say that I'm dreamin' over you
Someone so special
How could you say this, oh, so cruel

So when you're sayin' that you need love
I look at you and kinda smile
It's very hard just to convince you, baby
So maybe, this'll take a while

'Cause all that I wish for is just to be with you, baby
With a little love and squeezin' and holdin' you close
Girl, it's drivin' me crazy

All over love
  (All over love)
All over love
  (All over love)

All over love
  (All over love)
All over love
  (All over love)

Now that we've started
Let's make a relationship at last
Gettin' to know you
With nothin' to owe you, so I ask

Let's keep this real simple
When all the material things won't last
Show me you love me
If anything's different, then I'll pass

So when you say that you need love
I look at you with kinda smile
It's very hard just to convince you, baby
So maybe, this'll take a while

'Cause all that I wish for is just to be with you, baby
With a little love and squeezin' and holdin' you close
Girl, it's drivin' me crazy

All over love
  (All over love)
All over love
  (All over love)

All over love
  (All over love)
All over love
  (All over love)

'Cause all that I wish for is just to be with you, baby
With a little love and squeezin' and holdin' you close
Girl, it's drivin' me crazy

All over love
  (All over love)
All over love
  (All over love)

All over love
  (All over love)
All over love
  (All over love)

'Cause all that I wish for is just to be with you, baby
With a little love and squeezin', holdin' you close
Girl, it's drivin' me crazy

All over love, all over love
All over love, all over love
  (All over love)
(All over love)
