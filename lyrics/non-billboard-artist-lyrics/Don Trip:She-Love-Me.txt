She-Love-Me:Don Trip
[Chorus]
Okay
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me not
I'm flyer than a rocket ship and she's an astronaut
She just see the opportunity to ride me to the top
Okay
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me not
I'm flyer than a rocket ship and she's an astronaut
She just see the opportunity to ride me to the top

[Verse 1]
I got this bitch I just met
Say she love me to death
Say she love how I kick it
I say, bitch you need help
I'm no good for your health
All I care about is cash
I'll never give you my all, I'll never offer my last
See, I was broke as a son bitch back when nobody care
Started chasing that paper and pussy fell out the air
I hear the ghost of dead presidents live under my bed
While you count sheep to go to sleep, I'm counting money instead
Push that weight like the Rock, hope you smell what I'm cooking
I'm not fighting, I'm not shooting, I'm not dying for no pussy
That ain't my bitch, ain't finna wife that bitch, I barely like that bitch, one night that bitch, just had to pipe that bitch, then extradite that bitch
We gone, Poof!
Abra-Kadabra, bitch be on your way
She say after the key to my heart, sorry I locked that key in the safe and then I tossed that safe in the lake and it sunk and I sailed away
I got four babies and they love to race, so a bish is the last thing I'm gonna chase
I said, good day!
[Chorus]
Okay
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me not
I'm flyer than a rocket ship and she's an astronaut
She just see the opportunity to ride me to the top
Okay
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me not
I'm flyer than a rocket ship and she's an astronaut
She just see the opportunity to ride me to the top

[Verse 2]
She say she loves me but I can't help but think she bluffin'
Ain't no way that bitch got feelings for me, must be up to something
I know better, I know good and well, she don't mean me well
My G-Shock just sent a message, it say, only time will tell
She say, can you pay my Bill
I say, girl don't hold ya breath
I would rather rob a bank, get away with it, then confess
Fuck it look like?
Endorse my check to who, you? Bitch get real
She said, damn my nigga that cold
I said, bitch I know, so chill
Bitch I know you money hungry, I look like a Mil'
Ain't no Starter check, waiting on me to fix you, you about to start a dare
I heard all those sad songs before, you wasting all your breath
Fuck is you thinking?
You thought you caught me slipping?
You thought I lost a Step?

[Chorus]
Okay
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me not
I'm flyer than a rocket ship and she's an astronaut
She just see the opportunity to ride me to the top
Okay
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me not
I'm flyer than a rocket ship and she's an astronaut
She just see the opportunity to ride me to the top
