Forever-In-Love:Next Level
Verse 1 - Compound;

Baby I promise I'll never ever let you go
Make you happy, give you everything and more
Before I met you I mean it my heart was sore
That smile is unlike anything I've ever seen
Healed my heart like you were the vaccinne
You and I don't need any breaks inbetween
Forever in love and girl that's the reason why
You never need to ask me the question, why
Cause why doesn't matter when I fucking love you
Time was standing still the first time that I kissed you
I don't think I could cope if you ever walked away
Cause all I ever want is for you to just stay
I know I'm loving you more and more each day
When I know you're mine I can look straight to the sky
Always see the blue clouds cause they never turn grey
Me plus you equals forever in love uh

Cause you're always in my life

We're gonna reach the top now baby
Always be right by my side
It's me and you forever baby
Forever in love if you just believe

Verse 2 - Mackin;
I say I love you because it's true
I just want it to be me and you
I waited all my life stuck in the que
Have your name on my heart like a tattoo
Cause I know you're always gonna be down there
I never ever let you go I promise and I even swear
Spin the bottle, truth or dare
You know for a fact, I don't care
As long I have you, that's so fair
That's all I want, so please just be aware
I'll snuggle you to sleep, you can be my teddy bear
You're lovely with no make-up and bed hair
You're gorgeous, no wonder people just stop and stare
You're just mine, trust me I will never share
Love is crazy, call me maybe, be my hero and come and save me
