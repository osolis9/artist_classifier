Election-Day:Joell Ortiz
It's election day people
(YAOWA)
I voted for Bill Thompson

Right now I don't like the way the state of New York is
Fans voted me in so I'm the new man in office
Sick of what I'm hearing radios making me nauseous
Won it independently with no major endorsements
E-1, let's have a little fun
Bunch of voter furore was going on before I won
Look how many times niggas commercials getting spun
The old administration tryina play us like we dumb
And use hypnotism, same exact song
Different rhythm, now that we all hip let's get em
I got a gift of giving, lotta snakes in the game
Well I'm the vaccine til they hissing venom
Former leaders know they aint the best at this
Buncha old white men had the election fixed
I got support from G-Rap, support from KRS
On the Green Lantern show Nas said he think I'm next
My notions being seconded by legends in the game
You probably secretly accepting presents from a cane
Now that I'm appointed things'll never be the same
You'll actually have to rap to be a member in the game
Not just look good in the leather in a chain
Find a catchy beat and write a letter to T-Pain
Get a little single think you'll better get a name
I am hip hops redemption, Andy Dufresne

Chipped at them walls many years, now I'm free
Free like holmes who rep R.O.C.
Free like Shorty that hosted B.E.T.
Free like the Agent February 23
Yeah that should get some sort of order in rap
First law I'ma pass; legalise audio crack
Cause your favourite rappers looking like a Oreo snack
Got milk I put a spot built all in the crack
Of you ass didn't laugh cause you trash
I swear my flow tighter than them pants you little bastards wear
Oh that's the new fashion where;
You try and sag but your belt can't get past your rear
Your career won't even last a year
Never get past your little buzz like half a beer
2009 y'all finished many men
Next year y'all won't see me if your visions 2010
Get it? 20 - 10.
I understand if y'all don't get it
Sometimes my rhymes go over your head like fiddits
Always knew I had it when y'all said I didn't
Now everybody fucked like the red light district
It must be frustrating to know
That you really practice updating your flow
And in comparison to mine what you saying is slow
That's why the fans be so quick to say the man's Joe-
Double L - O - R - T - IZ what it is let's have a par-ty.

We won baby!
I wanna thank all my fans for supporting me for many years
I'm in office now. It's gon be a change
Joell Ortiz.
