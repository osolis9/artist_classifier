Rise-Fall:Nino Bless
(feat. Hemi)



[Verse 1: Nino Bless]
Everything is heaven until everything is hell
Everything's well, everything's rising, up up up, no it just fell
You got faith to sell i'm buying, i'm trying
A baby's born, tears of joy, while some one's love one is dying, fearful crying
Timing is everything right, til everything ain't right at the time
Must i deny the signs, that life decides to flash me with like every time
How the fuck can I prepare? i'm being honest here
Although I'm aware, know one day i won't have my momma here
And if that time is near or not, life will decide for sure
I'll just ride this course, the only thing that's certain is that we'll rise & fall

[Verse 2: Nino Bless]
These are the best of times yet I see armegeddon signs
The devil's embedded our minds so we'll be in his debt til we're dyin
In a fight with sight vs blind, which side are you on
If that lying eye on the back of the dollar has you one sided and guides you along
Man, and if i'm wrong then i'm wrong
We're guinea pigs the FDA's experimenting on
I can't stabilize my ground
Not too high when I'm up, not too low when i'm down, nah
Go on everyday, in any moment too shifty i'm staying balanced, feel me
Uh uh uh rising or dropppin, I'm on a even keal, and trying to keep it there as I stay
Go on for the ghetto
Folks that don't play victim, i love y'all
Some might need religion, but you are a God with no guidance
Don't follow me, lead
For the those on the block despaired starving, without a dollar to spare
Or that child out there, abandoned desperate to find some adopted par-rents if you feel ya appearance has you fearing ya reflection in the mirror
And that questioning just builds up, i get it
Lost a job you had it all now ya problems solvable odds
Seem improbable nah, nah
You make what's possible ya'll
Look at me, a kid from the Flatbush streets who took a hobby
And made music touching lives from Africa to Abu Dhabi
Brooklyn!

[Outro: Hemi]
We rise, we fall. But we're never alone
