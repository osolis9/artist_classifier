Snitch:Trip Lee
Yea*
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that

OK
It's T Lee and I'm back with a fresh flow
Even though I ain't really left though
Listen in close, this is one ain't a threat bro (No)
I'm just tryna help you move like the metro (let's go)
The worst snitch don't cut it on the block
Ain't tal'in bout them dudes that be runnin from cops
Ain't tal'in bout them dudes thats pitchin that D
Not you, not me, I'm snitchin on me
Familiar with the fact that I'm wicked
Born with sin from the beginning I lived in defeat
Can't sin n hide em in the back just to creep
I'm frontin stuff pullin covers up like a sheet
I love Christ, I don't wanna let me sense lie
But it's hard not to keep it on the inside
Can't stray and start livin for me
Livin foul man I gotta blow the whistle on me

No matter I don't wanna see no trash
So I'ma put me on blast(?)
Godliness I wanna see so bad
That I'm willin to put me on blast(?)
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch

Trip Lizzard and I'm back on the verse 2
Sin ain't a game look man it'll murk you
Ever since the fallen of the first two
But I can't perform no more no need for rehearsal
Y'all know how we like to do though
Frontin' like everything's nice when you know
You fallen real short of the life you shoot fo
We like kudos we don't like rebuke though
Not you gotta stop and ask
Do you hate sin and the (like?) it has
Or do you wanna paint it like you got this sin
(You stop it?) puttin all your stock in trash
I wish I could say that I'm always at my peak
But I would be lyin, sometimes I'd rather sneak
Since this sin be a pest of my soul till death
I'ma always be a snitch till I'm thrown to rest

No matter I don't wanna see no trash
So I'ma put me on blast(?)
Godliness I wanna see so bad
That I'm willin to put me on blast(?)
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch

If you hate yo sin you can play this song
Hate yo sin you just say this homes
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that
If you hate you sin you can play this song
Hate yo sin you just say this homes
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that

Young Trip L and I'm back a verse 3
Sin ain't my friend in fact it'a hurt me
Priase God for His Word that alerts me
If I confess my sin then I obtain mercy
Proverbs 28:13, James 5:16 He'll turn me
I used to hide all the time till it burned me
Now I confess to the Lord it's the first thing
Then I confess to my fam that I walk with
(Every?) lookin (granny?) have I lost it? (nope)
I just wanna live in light of what the cross did
Ain't just tryna look Christ like I'm tryna walk this
I ain't gotta prove that my works are the best (why?)
If it was up to me and my works I'd be stressed
But Christ already did the work with His death
I repent by faith in His works, I'm a mess

No matter I don't wanna see no trash
So I'ma put me on blast(?)
Godliness I wanna see so bad
That I'm willin to put me on blast(?)
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch
I'ma a snitch man, I'ma snitch

If you hate yo sin you can play this song
Hate yo sin you just say this homes
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that
If you hate you sin you can play this song
Hate yo sin you just say this homes
I'ma snitch, ain't ashamed of that"
