Black star will bring
Will make you laugh
Like you were
A little child again
Smooth, that's how I grow
I've got so much soul that
When I step into the party
I wanna move somebody

Play the masters
Of the ceremony
What does it take
To be a garage MC?
Personality
Originality
On a microphone
And got zippity

You and the K.N.O
Will get down
Represent that London town
My life is on the decks
Rock the disco people
I'm back in a sec

This one's for
The heads out there
Party people
Can you hear me clear?
If you like it
Let me see your
Hands in the air
If you don't
Y'all get the hell
Out of here

Bass is kickin'
Drums is drummin'
When you hear "d-d-d"
I'm comin'
Sharky represents
The west of London
