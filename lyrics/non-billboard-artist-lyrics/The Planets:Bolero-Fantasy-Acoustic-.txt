Bolero-Fantasy-Acoustic-:The Planets
I'm looking for my girl have you seen her about 5'6" tall, brown hair, with a piercing in her nose.
Her eyes tell the sweetest of lies, every time she smiles I get in a state of ecstacy.
I'm searching for my heart, since she stole it.
Why do, I feel like half of me is gone.
Seems like the hour glass, have turned against me, O where do I belong!
(don't say I'm in love with a fantasy,
am I in love with a fantasy-2x)
I'm looking for my wife to be, yes I have seen her me.
I know she's real, I feel it in my soul.
Her strength gives me reason to fly, far beyond the sky, oh I can feel her energy.
I sense her from a distance, I know you're there, I know you're there.
Baby...

But will the fortunes, oh spin into my blues
Where are you...

(Don't say I'm in love with a fantasy,
Am I in love with a fantasy-2x)

I don't care what anybody has to say,
I'm a dreamer but this is no dream!
I see her face from far away,
But I'm afraid.
(Don't say I'm in love with a fantasy,
Am I'm in love with the fantasy-2x)

(She's so real to me-6x)
