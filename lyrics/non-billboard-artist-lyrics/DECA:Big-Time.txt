Big-Time:DECA
look at me (look at me)
I'm doin' things (I'm doing things)
I'm do- mhm, (I'm doing things)
look at me
I'm doing things (I would do anything)
look at me

look at me
I'm doing things x3
look at me (look at me)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (I'm big time)
I'm doing things (I'm flat broke)
look at me (a troubadour)
I'm doing things (my head hurts)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)

broke stress toke less
fresh out the ocean's depth
overslept woke up in a cold sweat
soakin' wet
below the threshold of breath to get the full effect
when sun shines you can feel them in your solar plex
is it all a dream? (yeah)
is it all in vain? (no)
pulling out a brain child with forceps is painful
think big
aim high
entertain angels
stay gold in the stain fold of the same old
he's got a good song, he's got a certain style
every goddess on the planet wants to have his child
I'm thinking out loud, exhaling brown clouds
my guns go- your guns go pow pow
they're not figurative
I don't throw stones
I aim high and shoot holes in the ozone
I got big plans

to do big things

to spit pristine sixteens and live dreams

look at me (look at me)
I'm doing things (a pipe dream)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (my music bangs)
look at me
I'm doing things
I'm doing things (I'm deca 1)
I'm doing things
look at me (look at me)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (I'm big time)

I'm doing things (I'm flat broke)
look at me (a troubadour)

I'm doing things (my head hurts)

I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)

the sneak thieves trying to snatch what i got
I took the product off the table put it back in my sock
take a page out my book
sign your name on the top
take the hands you hold the mic with and place it on the chopping block
I'll lop it off, watch it drop and leak fluid
like your pop's old Buick, Judas
first you gotta go through this
you gotta make sure your bag's strong
I did everything in glorifying rap songs

made a fast buck hubris
bass drums gassed up by an opportunist with a snake's tongue
sounds dubious

catching blown kisses from a cutie's lips
acting out scenes from a movie script

I play a man that overslept, woke up in a cold sweat soaking wet, got dressed, grabbed his coat and left
by day, swallows pride and tries not to choke to death
by night he dreams little dreams in the ocean's depths

look at me (look at me)
I'm doing things (I'm pressing buttons)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (my music bangs)
look at me
I'm doing things x3
look at me (look at me)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (I'm big time)
I'm doing things (I'm flat broke)
look at me (troubadour)
I'm doing things (my head hurts)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
I'm doing things (I'm doing things)
