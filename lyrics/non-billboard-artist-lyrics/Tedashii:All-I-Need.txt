All-I-Need:Tedashii
Intro:
I see You're all I need/Father God I see you're all I need/ (All I need)
God, God you're all I need/to tell the truth LORD you're all I need/ (All I need)

Verse 1 (Tedashii):
They said I was going crazy on the campus when You saved me/
Cause I stopped partying, chasing all the ladies/
And they told me I was loosing it/calling me a lunatic/
Because, for you, that world; I told them I was through with it/
Man I heard the rumors/calling me a joke/
I'm praying saying, I wish they knew what I know/
Cause if they did they would see, how you were meant to be/
Much more than the god of emergencies/
You're the God that elected me/chose, and selected me/
When nobody else would mess with me/
Never neglected me/you even loved me when you corrected me/
Hands down you're the best to me/
I spent years of my life/trying to be liked or be like the people who seemed to be liked/
Following the crowd, trying to be allowed/Into a world where every thing seemed right/
But,

Hook (Chris Davis):
I wrote this song to tell you LORD you're all I need/(You're All I Need)
(God)/And I know you'll never fail me LORD/you're all I need/
And when the time gets crazy and my vision gets hazy Father/You're all I need/(You're all I need)
When my life needs saving/or the world starts to cave in/around me you're all I need/(You're all I need, You're all I need)

Verse 2 (Tedashii):
From saving me to raising me, shaping me and changing me/
Embracing me, taking me, making me yours/
Amazingly and graciously when I was lost and wavering/
Couldn't get from A to B/you opened the door/
I deserved to be left there/in distress with the rest there/
Right there in my mess yeah/
Still believing all the lies/the world can satisfy/
I almost died, pushing you to the side/
What a fool, making crazy moves/about to lose, all I had for a buzz and a thrill/
We too easily satisfied and that's just how Adam died, He was in the place where the love wasn't real/
But the more I get to know You/the more I get to know truth/
And through you I see who I am/
My identity revealed as you show me how to live, through the example of the God-man/
That's why,

Hook (Chris Davis):
I wrote this song to tell you LORD you're all I need/(You're All I Need)
(God)/And I know you'll never fail me LORD/You're all I need/
And when the time gets crazy and my vision gets hazy Father/You're all I need/(You're all I need)
When my life needs saving/or the world starts to cave in/around me you're all I need/(You're all I need, You're all I need)

Outro (Tedashii):
You're all I need/Father God I see you're all I need/ (All I need)
God, God you're all I need/to tell the truth LORD you're all I need/ (All I need)
And when the time gets crazy and my vision gets hazy Father/You're all I need/(You're all I need)
When my life needs saving/or the world starts to cave in/around me you're all I need/(all I need)
