i have been sipping on a hideous concoction
that seemed to make the world and all its creatures malfunction
and looking through the eyes of evil Edna on production
and using any gravestone i can find to build a dungeon
the sequence im compiling has me howling at the moon at 12
and sitting on a toadstool telling stories to a crew of elves 
the likelihood that you will ever feel the fucking same again
we see him with a hunchback ringing bells with just a ball and chain
its meager, listen to the daydream believer
'cause Mickey's not a monkey, he's a mouse that smokes sativa
look into my inner eye and tell me not a porky pie
'cause either i'm the genesis or this is just a genocide
no joke, no white sheets with the man inside
i'm haunted by the things that money brings but it cannot buy
so sing a lullaby for Rosemary, 
her baby is a devils child
and when she screams her nose will bleed
and this is not a TV show of hoes who have a silly dream
of making loads of cash from being something i could never be
i'm generating hoards of killer dolphins so that when you swim
they'll smack you half to death, with a beating from their dorsal fin
down in the underworld the beast is almost belly up
'cause man is natural sinister, he even made ??? bluff
fucking baby ay, he's praying who can save the day
my world is now a place that makes the devil wanna run away

did you ever see a rapper with our names on his tongue
even if he never did it, make him tell you what he done
string him up, string him up, make him tell you what hes done
string him up, string him up, make him tell you what hes done
did you ever see a rapper with our names on his tongue
even if he never did it, make him tell you what he done
string him up, string him up, make him tell you what hes done
string him up, string him up, make him tell you what hes done

im an urban inner city man, dont get up out your pretty pram
i'll slap you with a shitty hand, then feed you to a gritty clan
of pitiless religious freaks, who'll chop you into little bits
then pop you into jars then go and store you in the fridge for weeks
each with little stickers saying "something for the kids to eat"
when times are hard then i'll steal a car and go and find your yard
then burn it to the tarmac before i take the car back
me i'll take another trip to go to try and find your ma
and teach that bitch a lesson, how to raise a decent little guy
and take her fucking junkie pins and give her artificial eyes
there is no glory in a suicidal battle cry 
i'll slit your blubbered belly and leave you looking at your appetite
i'll use your little brain to paint a fucking satelite 
so stay the fuck away unless you're coming here to die tonight
and dont be tripping when you're walking in the streets i tread
i may be vegetarian dont think i wouldnt eat your leg
and grab you by your greasy hair and tie it to a stolen ped
and drag you through the streets until it pulls it out your swolen head
i bury all opponents dead beneath the fucking ground here
so bring yourself some armour if your gonna come around here
i'll send you both your girls ears
i swear my fucking worlds wierd
dont fucking piss me off you twatty toss
i'll grab the sheep shears
and kill you in your sleep counting sheep man i blacked out
so hold your fucking tongue before i cut your fucking cats out
