My-Calling:Sha Stimuli
I know you ask yourself a thousand times
Should you just keep dreaming are you out your mind? 
Its like if I get in the booth and doubt my rhymes
It’s like you giving up on your mission without you trying
Sometimes you gotta leave your house to grind
Make different circles that connect just like that Audi sign
They ask me when will I run out of lines
That’s like questioning your father
Don’t get out of line
But I know what you mean
You peep your competition and some of em in they teens
Got you in the fitting room wiggling in your jeans
‘Cause you trying to fit in
That’s just too extreme
Had a homegirl that was a singer now she teaching
Got another friend that was a stripper now she preaching
My dude was a rapper but his lyrics had him reaching doing videos w hoes fake jewels flashing heat and
When I saw it and he asked my opinion, we was speaking I said
You got some shit but I really was meaning feces
He started second guessing what was coming out his mouth
Month later son called me up like what’s this all about?
They writing comments on his shit it made him want to switch his route
He said he bout to get a Luger beat and say he’s from the south
And I pretended that my signal dropped
Yesterday his single dropped
Wish they had a red light on youtube that signaled stop. 
But people keep going
And who am I to tell em that they not the illest flowing
I was over at the Wendy’s bout to cop a number ten
Cashier looked at me with a spooky, silly grin
Said he seen me on the blogs, yo what’s up your name is Stim right? Sha that’s You, yo I told you that was him
I was hype for a second but I kind of held it in
Son gave me a pound, then called over his friend
Like yo my man’s nice we get busy we go in
We just working so we stack up this bread, we bout to win
I was thinking yea right
But looking like I’m real involved but mostly hoping that they speed up my order ’cause I was starving
Then they handed me a CD with the name written in marker
And an insert wit misspelled words I said you charging
They said, free for me and the meal is on the house
And they gave me extra barbecue sauce I walked out
Feeling weird, sort of happy that they seen I wasn’t balling
Now they know I’m down to earth and since I’m there I’m never falling
But my thought were steady drifting
Cause those kids believe their mission is to spit
And feel like rapping is their one and only calling
