Technicolor:The Planets
Coffee, Stereo
Lights out, Radio
Bright lights, Monochrome
Can't seem to get off my phone
You're mystical, cynical
But i don't know
I only see in black and white
Ohh

I think i saw you in Technicolor
I think i saw you in Technicolor
I fell in love in Technicolor
Ohh

It's not meant to be
Me and you, you and me
But i'll just try to work it out around
What people say it's right
(with)

Lonely times for you and me
Not long ago you set me free
It's always time to recreate
Stay with me
You're starting
To color my shadow I think i saw you in Technicolor
I think i saw you in Technicolor
I fell in love in Technicolor
I fell in love in Technicolor
