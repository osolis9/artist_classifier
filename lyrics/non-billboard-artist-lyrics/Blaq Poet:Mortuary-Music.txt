Mortuary-Music:Blaq Poet
Have no fear, Black Po’s here 
b***h-ass n****s to the back of the rear 
I just don’t care, it’s time for me to tear 
It’s time for me to leave the rhyming spree to bleed your ear 
I represent the streets, it’s hard for ends to meet 
n****s hustle to eat, police hustle the beat 
They trying to bust you in sweeps 
They trying to rest you in peace my n****s 
Follow me cause you can count on me 
Hardcore for life, f**k all that other s**t 
Blaq Poet Society, the new government 
f**k them rappers fronting for them cameras 
All the gimmicks and bullshit they all characters 
This s**t is real, nothing but true life 
I get ill, some say I’m too nice 
Some say I’m too crazy, some say I’m too nuts 
Some say I’m too wild but I don’t give two fucks

[Chorus]

Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s murder 
Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s done

Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s murder 
Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s done

[Verse 2]

I’m back spazzing, sitting back laughing 
This is the year of the black dragon, I flow with a mad passion 
You came to war with a water gun 
n****s know I slaughter them, this is just the beginning, there’s more to come 
Let’s be serious, I go so furious 
I rip y’all n****s from head to toe delirious 
This ain’t no regular raps and rhyme 
This is that terror to snatch your shine 
The secret is out it’s mine 
I’m ready for any kind of metaphor 
Any kind of petty war Cinco de Mayo bring em all 
And I ain’t looking for nobody’s approval 
I’m a Whoo-head for life though my words slice through you 
Haters can’t handle the pain, supreme I’mma reign 
Damn it’s a shame and I damage you lames

[Chorus]

Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s murder 
Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s done

Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s murder 
Black, no time for looking back 
Black, no time for looking back, it’s done
