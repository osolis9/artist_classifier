God-s-Language:Self Scientific
I hate to be labeled as paranoiac or dramatic
But reality is worse than a hore for the romantics
devilish ways lead to . I am trying to keep my sanity .
I have been looking in the mirror
A little bit deeper trying to get the picture clearer
But I am scared of what I am seeing
. for every wrinkle my face is a living monument
Memos of my travels and bales and my accomplishments
I never bee mistaken for . I am ion some . shit
.real talk niggers can fade them . interpretations .

Turn and fight our brother disrespect your mother
Selling drugs to your mother
. what I discover you nigger .
Remember government dont loves us
. into the heat I have been . by the street
To add stream to the hit . my mission
Is to tackle the ignorant . resurrect the light . bring the devil .
. will the devil bring illusion I . bring confusion . a rebel without a pause
. in the mean time we gotta stay hey
