Minds missing
just picture a scientific experiment
and Einstein couldn't figure where it's goin'
Well then what does that make me? (whoa)
Imagine waking up in a wreck
have the thought of your own thoughts
talking under your breathe (ha, ha, ha)
Shivering with sweat on your chest
The sleep paralysis alone is as dark as it gets
I'm try'n to tell you that it's
Oh very, so scary, oh baby, you're getting up on my last nerves
This coffin so dark
heading to the end of the road
And I'm ready for your conscience
It's haunting is taking its toll.
So I held on the cards I was dealt
Try'n to buckle seat belts
Cuz my brains always trapped in a cell
Cuz it's all too unbearable to face on my own
I'm so alone
Can somebody just...

Every time that I give it control (Did it hurt)
Every time that it's killing my soul (Did it hurt)
All those years and the tears in the cold (Did it hurt)
It's like a black hole that's eating me whole
Set in stone
It's like everywhere and place that I go
They're all like (wow)
Maybe that's the only reason of why you wrote this (down)
Probably cuz I got a bigger than the Eiffel (Tower)

Hello, is this the monster?

It's your conscience, of course I'm a monster
you bonkers? Your screw's just a little bit loose?
Are ya yonkas?
It's me everyone wants to meet
It's your conscience

Well maybe I should just try to leave you up there
cuz in my head you're not real I'm not even aware
that my surroundings eating me up
and it makes the hairs on my neck stand up
