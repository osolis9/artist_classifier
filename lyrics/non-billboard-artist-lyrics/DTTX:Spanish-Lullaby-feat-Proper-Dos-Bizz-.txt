Spanish-Lullaby-feat-Proper-Dos-Bizz-:DTTX
last night i dreamt of San pedro
just like i'd never gone, i knew this song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
it all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
all of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
la isla bonita
and when the samba played
the sun would set so sigh
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
your spanish lullaby

the beautiful island

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
they went away so fast

he told you'i love you'

Tropical the island breeze
all of nature wild and free
this is where i long to be
La isla bonita
and when the samba played
The sun would set so high
ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby

the beautiful island

i want to be where the sun wqrms the sky
when its time for siesta yiu can watch them go by
beautiful faces, no cares in this world
where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night i dreamt of a San pedro
it all seems like yesterday, not far away

(CHORUS TWICE)
