Diced-Pineapples:Ash Kardash
You see' something 'bout this dude got me trippin'
Cause I'm willing to give up all that I've got,
All to have what I've been missin'
And I'm like
"Is you crazy?"
Goes the conscience in my mind
Cause this the same old thing
That happened to you last time

Remember how you gave him yo' heart?
And in the end that nigga stepped on it
And than you gave him all your love n'
And in the end that nigga pissed on it
And you were hurt,
You were in so much pain
You should've listened when they had told you,
"These niggas all the same"

But I see something different in you
Something that makes me think otherwise
Like, definitely, perhaps?
Your nothing like these other guys,
So I stay
And yeah, maybe that makes me dumb
But those who've never loved, will never know where I'm coming from

And boy, you put me through a lot
And should I be with you?

(Hell)

Prolly' not
Because every day
It's the same shit
We going back and forth
About a different bitch
And then I'm mad and crying
And asking you why you lying
And you tell me to stop crying' cause you
Ain't doing shit,
You tellin' me to grow up
Cause all these bitches is mad,
And all they doin' is hating,
And they can't prove it

So than I'm thinking to myself
Like, you know what?
Maybe this nigga didn't
And then I come to my senses and I'm like
Hell nawh
Him?
I know this nigga did it,
So I get mad and send you a text that I don't mean at all,
And your reply to me,
Is no reply at all
So then I'm sitting there like,
Ain't this about a bitch?
Cause I hate it when you do that shit
In my Wayne voice

And I know this is a double MG song
But on any beat
I can get my Wayne on

And I'm just thinking from the heart
Thought I would keep this cover simple
But before I sing the hook,
Shout out to - beats for the instrumental

And I'm like
I guess I'm in my feelings right now
I guess I'm in my feelings right now

I guess I'm in my

I guess I'm in my feelings right now
I guess I'm in my feelings right now

Because I'm writing songs bout' you

You got me writing songs bout' you I guess I'm in my feelings

But he say
Why you always trippin'?
Keep tellin' you that I ain't doin' shit
But you don't wanna listen
That's why I say you crazy, acting like you lost yo damn mind
How you be making up these stories
And assuming stuff all the time

I told you to grow up
And stop always arguing
And stop always going off
And being worried about another bitch
Then maybe you won't be hurt
And in so much pain
And get that shit out yo head about these niggas being all the same
Cause I'm tryna be somethin' different fo' you.
But you think otherwise
I'm tryna prove to you, that I'm nothing like these other guys.
And just because you stay, that don't make you dumb
It just means you're a rider who knows where I'm comin' from

And he like

Girl, I put you through alot
And should you be with me?
(Hell)

Prolly not
Because every day
It's the same shit
We going back and forth
About a different bitch
And than you mad and crying and asking
Me why I'm lying
And I tell you to stop crying' cause I
Ain't doing shit
I'm tellin' you to grow up
Cause all these bitches is mad
And all they doin' is hating
And they can't prove it!

But then you stop thinking to yourself
Like you know what? Maybe this nigga didn't it
Tryna convince you that am being honest
But you be sure a nigga did it
Now you mad being silly actin brand new
Textin me all this shit, and saying me you hate me too
Now I'm sitting there
Cause I'm supper pissed
Cause I hate it when you do that shit!

In my Wayne voice
And I know this is a double MG song
But on any beat
I can get my Wayne on

And am just speaking from the heart
Thought id keep this cover real
But before you sing the hook you already know the deal

And he like

I guess you in your feelings right now
I guess you in your feelings right now

I guess you in your

I guess you in your feelings right now
I guess you in your feelings right now

Because you're writing songs bout' me
You got you writing songs bout' me I guess you in your feelings

Hey
