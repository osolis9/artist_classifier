Call Me
If you're feeling sad and lonely,
There's a service I can render.
Tell the one who loves you, only,
I can be so warm and tender.

Call me.
Don't be afraid, you can
Call me.
Maybe it's late, but just
Call me.
Tell me and I'll be around.

If you call, I'll be right with you.
You and I should be together.
Take this love I long to give you,
I'll be at your side forever.

Call me.
Don't be afraid, you can
Call me.
Maybe it's late, but just
Call me.
Tell me and I'll be around.

Now don't forget me,
Cause if you'll let me,
I will always stay by you.
You've gotta trust me,
That's how it must be.
There's so much that I can do.


Call me.
Don't be afraid, you can
Call me.
Maybe it's late, but just
Call me.
Tell me and I'll be around.

Call me.
Call me.
Just call me.
Tell me and I'll be around.

Call me.
Just call me.
Call me.
Just call me.
Call me.
Just call me.
