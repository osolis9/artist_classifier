Nite-Falls:Sheek Louch
Let the wolfs out*
He comes to... again
His skin is darker
Think I'm shopping the... again
Stash... opened up the rooms again
Party is over
But we ain't popping over... again
You see the 40 on my waist
They see my face
They'll be like
A... noise
When the nite starts to fall
I'm painting this vivid picture
In my private...
The bullets will come to get you
You see... night time to a sunny
Hey man don't be fucking with my money
They'll be like
When the nite starts to fall
And where we go from here

Is it safe
Is it... clear
Is it... ear
Is it the women in the trunks and the cars
And the jewels on the bodies... news
I ain't playing with these fools
They see me they'll be like
Show off
They see me they'll be like
As crazy
When the nite starts to fall

Stupid isn't stupid
He's going down
Understand how stupid he was
But it's ironic cause he got a stupid boss
... super false
... is your time
When the nite starts to fall
