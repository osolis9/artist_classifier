A-B-C-:Another Bad Creation
Comin' from the playground
Take it straight back to the bricks
Yo Chris, tell 'em where it is

Chillin', cooler den a squeak, kickin' dirt on my sneakers
Suckers on the corner lookin' down at their beepers
They couldn't get a job or a nice home
So they wanna stay and wait for the pay-phone

Take JoJo he's the youngest
Girls jock him 'cuz he's reverse dressed
[Unverified] strollin' through the neighborhood
Sweatin' their brother tryin' to see why he's doin' good

Rollin' through the park tryin' to make another hit
Little do they know that soldiers' legit
I'm not sayin' this to put nobody down
This is what I see at the playground, ya' know

Aww yeah, another ABC smash gonna make ya mad
Uh, come on, come on everybody
And guess who's up next, kick it

L I L D A V E, 4 feet shorty of the crew
Just let me get on the mic and show you what I can do
When I'm all alone, cold rockin' on the microphone
At home [unverified] playin' under the phone
[Unverified] dis time little home

Kick it D, kick it D, kick it
Pump it D, pump it D, pump it
Swing it D, swing it D, swing it

I swing my beats at the playground, ya' know
(Everybody)
Come on y'all, good assault is in effect
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
I don't wanna see nobody sittin' in their chair
True dat, true dat, yo Ro, you are next

Well, I'm RoRo comin' in third
Now it's about that time that I get heard
And none of my rhymes will never ever be swerved
Word to her play tricks on your nerves
Everywhere I serve is real superb
And I'll be right back with part two of this funky rhyme G

Haha, yeah boy

Yo Red, I don't wanna flow no more man
Y'all go ahead, I'm just gonna sit back
And listen to this ghetto swing
'Cuz this is what I do, at the playground
Ya' know what I'm sayin'

Aww yeah, ABC's gonna sing, added to this missile
Fusion hip hop with a little ghetto swing
Yo Red, kick the ballistics G

It's the R to the E to the D and what you get is what you seein'
Straight up B boy word to Miss
Kickin' and flippin' the rhymes for the kids man for the kids
Chillin' in the park, nice and smooth

JoJo Mark tried to bust my groove
Ahh, I hate that
Had a big fanny not like Annie
Gave her the 24 letter and some candy, ah ah

Ay yo Red, where'd you meet her?
At the playground, ya' know

Okay, I guess you know by now
Big smash moves
Pants inside out

Into the Mizzark, chillin' in the pizzark
I got a break 'cuz my mother said be home by dizzark
But before I go I'm gonna flow for you in time see
So listen to the rhyme G

The East Coast Family, Boyz To Men, ABC, BBD
Now flip the tracks D
My mother is mad and my brother is Red
Mario Brothers, bed
Last but not least I wanna say peace and we outta here
From the playground, ya' know
