[Featuring: Big Sik and Edbone]

Pac Div them niggas and you know that shit
'Bout to get some millions and I blow that shit
I'm a get me some greens and I grow that shit
Put some bitches on sale and I smoke that shit
Appreciate that pussy now I own that shit
If any y'all need pussy I can loan that shit
Roast that pussy, roast that pussy, roast that shit
When a nigga get finished bring that dope back
Pimp game for your membrane
I been the illest motherfucker since Rick James
Give it to me, you should see me when I switch lanes
On the freeway doing 90 leaving shit stains

Savages, savages
T shirt shaped from Mexico
Might grade it to Los Angeles
I make her so mad and shit
She be talking spanish shit
I can't understand and shit
But she be looking bad and shit
What can I do?

Word to Big Sik I just wanna be a boss player
Hundred mouths running charging to my pros trainers
I'm Hugo Boss get new lacrosse not mangine
Niggas fists can't fuck with what I pull up ross hangers
Let le floss flagrant then we got a statue
Show time stables any day might put our statues up
Aqueduct water flow where I'm at the party go
Green giant kush in the shroom to super mario
Got that, innovated, old 6 we innovated
Whole click a nigga's kanging
Oh shit we mini merely it
Tell them hoes we just going for
Resources in your open tone
Fuck it if it ain't open though
One calling is Kosovo
Pac Div easy like a former grip
Chardonney and morning pill she say it's for the thrill
Holla out the name bitches listen for me
Nasty after shows poopies give it to me

Give it to me [x8]

Like a homie blowing chilling with the homies
Phony niggas keep it moving
Don't be acting like you know me
I don't have the patience and there's no acquaintance
Bitches hit me up and when they ready for relations we get drunk
Sloppy, over do you copy?
Hate me 'cause I'm cocky haters wanna chop me
Watch me close, sit back and I pose
I'm a pharmacist, hit me anytime you need a dose
I'm out here bad bitches do the most
Raised around killers burnt like toast
Burned like rotisserie raised up in misery
Pay the world back for the probs that was given me

Bad bitch she was poppin my in hand
I'm digging in her pocket center panties
Get it understood I'm a star in the hood
Fuck an oscar and a grammy
I burn that bitch come Sissy do it
Heartbreak kid this that sweet chain music
No heart he's centering the pain
All off in her ear tryin' to send her on a date
Soda from the corner store then I go pour for
They say that I'm that nigga yea
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
In the glass I'm dames with a mask and a stash
Tryin to pass like pay

Give it to me [x8]
