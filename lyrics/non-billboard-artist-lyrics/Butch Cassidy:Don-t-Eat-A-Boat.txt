Don-t-Eat-A-Boat:Butch Cassidy
Our Lord's a jealous God
Filled with vengeance and wrath
He takes revenge on all who oppose
Loot the silver
Plunder the gold
There's no end to this love that doesn't go untold

This toxic mercury will break the glass
And the temperature will hit triple digits
And we'll all watch as this town burns down
But we're not burning down with it

What sorrow awaits the city of murder and lies?
Mistress of deadly charms and countless casualties
All who hear of your destruction will clap their hands in joy
I am your enemy!
I am your enemy!

This toxic mercury will break the glass
And the temperature will hit triple digits
And we'll all watch as this town burns down
But we're not burning down with it

And I,
I'll trace this back to nights when we set this town on fire [x2]
I'll trace this back to nights when we set this town on fire

YEAHH!
