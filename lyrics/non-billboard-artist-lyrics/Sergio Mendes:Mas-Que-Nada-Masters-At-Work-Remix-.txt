Mas que nada
Black Eyed Peas
Came in to make it hotter
We beat the party starters

Bubblin' up just like lava
Like lava heat it like a sauna
Penetrating into your body armor
Rhythmically we message ya
With hip hop mixed up with samba

With samba, so yes, yes, y'all
You know we never stop
We never rest y'all

The Black eyed peas
Are keeping it funky fresh, y'all
And we won't stop until
We get you, til we get you

Oari rai
Ob, ob, ob
Oari rai
Ob, ob, ob

Peter piper picked peppers
But tab rocked rhymes
1, 2, 3 for several times
Heavy rotation made by every kind
Of radio stations, blessing every mind

And we crossing boundaries like everyday
We got, we got tab magnification, tab magnified
Like every day, so yes, yes, y'all
You know we never stop, we never rest, y'all y'all
The Black Eyed Peas are keeping it funky fresh, y'all
And we won't stop until we get you, til we get you sayin'

Oari rai
Ob, ob, ob
(L, l, l, l, l)
Oari rai
Ob, ob, ob

Drop hot, hot, be my daily operation
Got to put a right in this crazy occupation
Gotta keep it movin' that's the motivation
Gotta ride the waves and keep a tight relation

With my team keeping moving and doing it right
I've been in a lab every day til daylight
That's the way things move in this monkey business
We took a old samba song and remixed it

Mas que nada
Sai da minha frente
Eu quero passar
Pois o samba esta animado

O que eu quero e sambar
Este samba
Que e misto de maracatu
E samba de preto velho
Samba de preto tu

Mas que nada, we gonna make you feel lil hotter
Peas and Sergio Mendes heating up samba
Bada, ba, ba, ba, ba, baa
Sergio play your piano
Sergio play your, yo, yo, yo, yo, piano
