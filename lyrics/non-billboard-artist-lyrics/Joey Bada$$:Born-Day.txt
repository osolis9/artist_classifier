Born-Day:Joey Bada$$
And I'm a hot nigga
Cause where was OG Bobby Johnson
To tell young Shmurda that he had some better options
You wanna blame the streets that adopted him

Or the doctrine that got his mind so boxed up in
And I don't judge, but there's no one to blame but us
And that's the truth, but it's always swept under the rug
