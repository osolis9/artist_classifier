Hiphop-Music:Rob Swift
I don't bust caps or press em on Krylon cans
I just stand on stage with the MIC in my hand
8 years ago, no friend of mine
was around to talk, so I'd sit and write rhymes
I can't say, hiphop is all bad cause it isn't
sometimes it makes me mad and I eject it from my system
this is an art-form, a form of expression
communication, something that youth relate with
gang related or peace statements, it's all up to the artist
we got, freedom of speech and each aims for a different target
different markets, different agendas, different intentions
some are pure, some are offensive
I'm just, one of many different sides represented
or should I mention, each individual is their own extension
speaking their perspective, so in this game I hold my own
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my home

Hiphop started in the Bronx, come on
now it lives all over the world
people of all types embrace the culture, bang the music
get into it, start a movement, keep doing it
when you write your first rhyme don't expect to be
considered the best mc, develop your flavor and recipe
if you wanna see success it takes a lot of sacrifice and effort
just because you got a flow doesn't get you cheddar
call it cash money, I hate slang and stereo types
for all mediums I give the same advice
no matter what you strive for, no matter what goals you got
there's no short cut to the golden pot, the plot thickens
I spit out lyrics like their lukewarm but keep it hot
plant seeds to feed the flock when the beat knocks
stay focused on God, bless tracks with passion
I'll be loving hiphop till my flesh turns to ashes

I got a love/hate relationship with hiphop, it frustrates me
it can break these rusty chains or drive me crazy
I'm a rhyme spitting, time bomb ticking
Christ is living, and died, to save me from this worlds sickness
when people think of rap music they relate it to players, pimps
paper chasers and gang bangers, but don't forget
just cause you see them scenes in videos
doesn't mean, that for every mc, that's how it really goes
the truth is, hiphop is diverse as earth is
what a man speaks reflects the world he's immersed in
and the condition of his heart, yo it's hard to judge it
most these rappers would be nothing, without their budget
and record labels, paying for promotions
putting their face on posters, while they posing
but see, hiphop music gave a voice to the streets
plus it made profit, so now everybody wants a piece
I wasn't down from the beginning but since I started
I've been true to God, myself and true to the art
all I got left to say for everybody east to west
represent hiphop right if you want it to get respect
