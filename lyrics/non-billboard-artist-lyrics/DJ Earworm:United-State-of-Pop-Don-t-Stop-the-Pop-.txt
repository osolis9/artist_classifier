United-State-of-Pop-Don-t-Stop-the-Pop-:DJ Earworm
Do what you wanna do, uh uh
You can do what you wanna do, uh uh
It's all inside you
Amen, Amen

Can't stop, won't stop moving
Don't speak the language
The music don't need explaining
I know that in the morning now
It's gonna be alright
I keep grooving
Do I have to tell you,
This music is beautiful too
All I really need to understand is, I'll be alright

Because you know I'm all about that bass, about that bass
Don't tell ‘em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell ‘em
No treble
I'm all about that bass, about that bass
Don't tell ‘em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell ‘em
Because you know I'm all about that boom boom,
About that bang bang
About that beats
About that bass
About that music

Katy Perry, Juicy J, Jason, I-G-G-Y, Nicki, Jessie and Ari
My God
There's no going back

So you can do what you wanna do
You already know
You can do what you wanna do
From LA to Tokyo
It was all inside you all the time
Remember my name,
Well, now they know

So all the cups got broke
I'm gonna show ya
It's clear to see
It wasn't my fault
I got one less, one less, problem
Am I tripping for having a vision?
My prediction: I'mma be on top of the world

Can't stop, won't stop moving
Don't speak the language, the music
Don't need explaining
Let it go, let it go
And you let her go
It's gonna be alright
Say yes, say yes
The answer is, is music
What's really crazy
All I really need to understand is, I'll be alright

Because you know I'm all about that bass, about that bass
Don't tell ‘em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell ‘em
No treble
I'm all about that bass, about that bass
You ain't even gotta tell ‘em
It's gonna be alright
But I know you want it
Boom, bad bass, bad bass
Don't tell ‘em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell ‘em
No treble
I'm all about that bass, about that bass
You ain't even gotta tell ‘em
That's what you wanna do

Can't stop, won't stop moving
Don't speak the language, the music
Don't need explaining
I know that in the morning now, it's gonna be alright
I keep grooving
Do I have to tell you

So you can do what you wanna do
You already know
You can do what you wanna do
From LA to Tokyo
It was all inside you all the time
So you can do what you wanna do
That's what you wanna do
There's no going back

I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane (London to Taiwan)
From LA to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, ‘bout to blow, oh, oh
That's what you wanna do
Amen, Amen, Amen
