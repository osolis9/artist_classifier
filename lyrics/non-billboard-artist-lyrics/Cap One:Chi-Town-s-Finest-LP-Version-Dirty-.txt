Chi-Town-s-Finest-LP-Version-Dirty-:Cap One
Nigga, I'm 'bout 4 seconds off yo ass
When I get that itch, you betta pass 'cause I'm ready to blast
Breaking them motherfuckers off
When pistol pumpin' hollow points you ain't gonna last

'Cause I'm 'bout to fuck you straight up
Shit, I be dippin' up in the club, my milla-meter go buck
Now you bogus as fuck, shit outta luck
I'm a murder your spot in yo gut

And run up right beside of yo crib
Jus talkin' 'bout shit you just did, neva tellin' the pigs
About the weapons and the work you put in
To find where I hide my shit
'Cause she was all on my dick

Wonderin' where I be hustlin' and bustin' niggaz on the block
Servin' rocks, I was hot but I to keep takin' 'cause I had to get rich
Now I got a lil bit of scratch, navigator and a 'llac
You be on a nigga back, said you tired of servin' packs

You want me to front you a few G sacks
So I broke you off a lil some, some
Give a nigga high off one bum, from the jump, make yo body slump
Make the Tempo pump, 'cause you servin' dem gumps

From the Westside to the Southside
Because we be ready to ride because we 'bout pride
What was Cowhide, do what was hard, now high, we 'bout die
Put him off the temp ready to hurt 'em, now they mouth wide

We murders that will bust all of y'all
Togetha brotha, we ball or fall
Cap.One, bitch, shinin' to ya like I'm 'bout to draw
Windy City haters, fuck all of y'all

To the gangstas and hustlers, Chi thugs, throw it up
While we smoke 5-bo let's get buck
Why we rollin' to the Westside?
Nigga, let's ride to the Southside and roll 'em up

And you know I can't forget 'bout
My niggaz and bitches who had my back when I was out on the cut
Hit the clutch, we 'bout to whip up the club
Trippin', we gonna pick up the punk

To the gangstas and hustlers, Chi thugs, throw it up
While we smoke 5-bo let's get buck
Why we rollin' to the Westside?
Nigga, let's ride to the Southside and roll 'em up

And you know I can't forget 'bout
My niggaz and bitches who had my back when I was out on the cut
Hit the clutch, we 'bout to whip up the club
Trippin', we gonna pick up the punk

How many niggaz wanna bust the gunshots
Touch the glock, back on the block for my niggaz that pop one shot
Murderous niggaz that put the barrel in yo mouth
And bury it outside, cop keys on the drive

Love, love all my bitches and thugs that put a slug
In any nigga that fuckin' wit my blood
Hey, hate for any nigga for to stay
And for the fake niggaz fuckin' wit J

I can't wait to kill, kill all nigga that will
This shit is real, when you up in the field, in my field
Take, take a nigga life to see
How many niggaz wanna die for me

Now motherfucker, wild, wild is the home, holla Southside
And it's on, I'ma ride wit my chrome, I'm a silent the chrome
Take the whole world on my own
Nigga, I'ma die on the throne

It's the bitch that killed the shit
Now fuckin' wit this, I love you dicks
Runnin' up wit the dick, wanna lick
A big bitch, wit big dreams and big shit

Fuck wit a nigga that put the gleam on the wrist
Killaz, wild ass niggaz, drug dealerz
Motherfuckers that put lead all up in ya
Send you to bed, the bloodshed with the red to yo head
When you fuck wit guerillas

To the gangstas and hustlers, Chi thugs, throw it up
While we smoke 5 bo let's get buck
Why we rollin' to the Westside?

And you know I can't forget bout
My niggaz and bitches who had my back when I was out on the cut
Hit the clutch, we bout to whip up the club
Trippin', we gonna pick up the punk

Shit, I love when I get on the block not even goin' thru a thang
Spittin' it for niggaz and bitches who holla my name
You feelin' more pressure and pain
Niggaz is jealous and wanna step out of the game

You tellin' me life is the same
I'm tellin you niggaz, you sheisty for the price of the fame
Or have niggaz goin' insane
Spittin' it for niggaz and bitches who want me to reign

Enter the mind of a Don, Cap to tha Dot to tha One
Nigga, who we pop wit the guns
On the block, all day, tryin' to get my money right
Niggaz on the roof lookin' out wit the ones

Wit the fucks, ice, I say get down on my nutts
Bounce wit a pound in the trunk
Fuckin' wit some hoes, watch dem go up in the room
Every nigga who I'm down gon bust

Hit it from the Don, blow dro quick wit the chrome
Blaze till six in the morn
Slide to the club, hoes wanna show a nigga love
Shit, we can ride drinkin', Bone, "Foe tha luv of tha"

Niggaz and bitches that push weight
And flip gates, flick to da lake
Ballin' C A P Dot, gun cock
Run in yo spot, lick shots and give a fuck

To da mallin', so I be reppin' da wild
Niggas in front with the tech and the crowd
Spit rhythms and get 'em buck wit many styles
Get patience, what da fuck nigga we out

Niggaz dat be wit me on da tip
Let 'em know that it's on, T and Shawn, Cap One who da Don
