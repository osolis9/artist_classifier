Back-To-Love-Candle-Light-Mix-feat-Jay-Sean-:DJ Pauly D
Can't you feel it? All that space in between us
I know you can feel it, I miss you just a little too much
Memories in the breeze, are they gone now?
Thought that I would be right but I'm wrong now
Know you can feel it, I miss you just a little too much
We built it up and let it all crash down
We had it all and let it burn to the ground
And maybe we can turn around and get back
'Cause right now I'm off track
And I'm looking for a way back to love
I need you now, I'm feignin' for your touch
Come back to love
Oh yeah
Come back to love
Ooohh
Do you see all that everything we were turned into dust
See do you believe it? Can we ever get back to us?
Memories in the breeze, are they gone now?
Thought that I would be right but I'm wrong now
I know you can feel it, I miss you just a little too much
We built it up and let it all crash down
We had it all and let it burn to the ground
And maybe we can turn around and get back
'Cause right now I'm off track
And I'm looking for a way back to love
I need you now, I feignin' for you touch
Come back to love
We built it up and let it all crash down
We had it all and let it burn to the ground
But maybe we can turn around
See maybe we can turn this day around
Pick it off the ground
We can remember what we found
'Cause we built it up and let it all crash down
We had it all and let it burn to the ground
So maybe we can turn around and get back
'Cause right now I'm off track
And I'm looking for a way back to love
I need you now, I feignin' for you touch
Come back back to love
Oooh
Come back to love
Come back to love, back to love
Come back to love
