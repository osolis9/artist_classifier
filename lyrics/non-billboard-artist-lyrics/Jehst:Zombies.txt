Zombies:Jehst
Verse 1
Heavy hitting like Kimbo Slice
Precise
Like the blade that Yo Jimbo sliced
? too tight
Rambo knife
Slang theory
Red-reg round my head
Your clan fear me
Red-rag to a bull
Don’t come near me
China shop taurus
Getting more than rawkus
I’m more like a walking thesaurus
Tyrannosaurus rex
Loose in the audience
Beats make the ornaments
Fall off the mantlepiece
Dick in your mouth, with my balls on your mammaries
Smile for the camera
Please say “Cheese”
I make it look easy
Moneyshots on the break-beats
Hardcore porn how I’m fucking with rap
You were trying to crossover
Now you’re stuck in the gap
My syntax like busting a gat
In a cave
You can hear the echoes resonating through the rave
Making soundwaves transform
And translate
Universal
In your boombox everday
Like Parky & Tiffany Paige
I flip the script to a different page
Dismissing a fake
Your crew’s fruitier than Christmas cake
Hollow threats
That you’re in no position to make
And right now it’s all about the Boot Crew
Tell me how do you do the voodoo that you do?
All these other dudes is doodoo
Looking like Ali G
Bright yellow FUBU
I keep it tight like Yogi & Bobo
The sniper
Billy got more hits than Youtube

Chorus
We’re gone worldwide
Smashing a set
My flows baptise
Splashing your head
So just hold tight
We’re back from the dead
Attack of the killer rap zombies!

Verse 2
You see
My art attack like Neil Buchanan
When I reveal the cannon
Like the genie and the magic lanten
Stay concealed untill it’s time to grant wishes
Death wishes
I’m Charles Bronson
You’re dead, bitches!
And that applies to both genders
Candy-rappers got hard shells and soft centres
Confectionary emcees are all Forrest Gump
‘Cause life’s not like a box of chocolates, chump
I’m trying to get rich like Donald Trump
But I’m looking at my crib like
What a dump
Beats got to bump
Like cars in the fairground
How many bars are prepared now?
How many stages?
I tear down rags
How many guys took a chunk out my raps?
And ain’t giving nothing back
Enough of that
Billy puff a sack of Green Crack till I’m black
With my Baron Greenbacks in a stack
It’s danger for a mouse ’cause I want crazy cat
Tom & Jerry shit
You got a hatchet, you better bury it
I swing tomahawk like I’m Native American
Lungs full of medicine
Chick with a bumper like gelatin
I predict something developing

Chorus
We’re gone worldwide
Smashing a set
My flows baptise
Splashing your head
So just hold tight
We’re back from the dead
Attack of the killer rap zombies!
