Bag Da Biscuit (Ain't Nuttin' But A...)
[Saukrates]
I'll be your sugar daddy
Yo
   "Party party"
Ca-ca-ca-ca-can you feel it? Nothing can save ya
From the money run, getting those papers
Or from catching the vapours
No chance for miss chances or mistakers
But you hun you get new ones
Checkin' out the way you and your crew spun
Into the, spot I love a plot that unfolds in front of these eyes
I want ya, to relate to fake 'cause when I taunt ya
I'm leaving you with words that will haunt ya
Give me two minutes to get in it with a chick
I take two hours reaping the benefits
That's for real (yo) so honey what's the deal
Let me know if you ain't feeling it
If you is then we four wheeling it
Plus, my dog's got your girlfriend kicking her butt
   "Party party"
Can you get down whether or not giving a fuck
Type of disposition to hop into the truck
Who knows with a little bit of luck
We might let each other get a taste or a touch

CHORUS [Saukrates] (Female singers)
You coming with us (he making a fuss)
So what, it's nothing but a "party party"
You looking for love, but all you getting is lust
It ain't nothing but a "party party"
You coming with us (he making a fuss)
So what, it's nothing but a "party party"
You looking for love, but all you getting is lust
It ain't nothing but a "party party"

[Saukrates]
Yo, I'm night dreaming of becoming a "party party"
I know sometimes it seems odd to ya
Why nigga's always got to be starting up
Why them nigga's always got to be parking up
But check it, I know I ain't the first or the last
But your intuition is telling you to crash
I can feel it, I can feel it, I guess that's why
We all in the whip feeling hippy hippy fly
We all in the whip feeling the natural high
When we get to my crib, we going to give this a try right
She said 'nigga fly right, and we might'
Just put it down, all it takes is trust
I said 'what?'  yes yes y'all, yiggy yes y'all
Waiting for the moment when I see your dress fall
If you're wondering what's happening next
Y'all it's triple X-rated, take a guess
   "Party party" y'all

CHORUS

Life ain't nothing but a "party party"
Bitches ain't nothing but a "party party"
?Krunk beats be doing? "party party"
I love something just for the "party party"
We all got something for the "party party"
Life aint nothing but a "party party"
Bitches ain't nothing but a "party party"
Tricks ain't nothing but a "party party"

CHORUS X3

   "Party Party"  *repeated*
