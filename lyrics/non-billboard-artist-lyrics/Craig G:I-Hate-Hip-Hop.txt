I-Hate-Hip-Hop:Craig G
[numerous intro chatter for 20 seconds - hard to transcribe]

Hip-hop nowadays seems different to me
Everybody's bustin a shot or flippin a ki
Is it real? (Hell yeah) Well it isn't to me
It seems a lot of these wack rappers are livin for free
With their talk-about name tags, designer frames and bags
Peruvian coke connects that they never had, huh
Dressed up videos co-starring De Niro
To them ghetto dwellers, you label street heroes
THAT'S A SHAM! Don't get caught out there man
They'll put a bullet in your temple just as quick as they can
then they'll scram, you're nothin but a stuttered out, piece of flesh
in the next man's GS I guess
All that tough talk on wax ain't according to many facts
It was a facade you put on, when your lawyer got your contracts
And the way you went down got me heated
Your presence in hip hop ain't needed so beat it, uh yeah huh
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
Yeah yeah yeah, you's a real tough niggaro
Back in '80-somethin I saw you dancin in the videos
Frontin hard, for the AV squad
In high school, you was just a branded fool
Dressin preppy, you must've ate too much spaghetti
Flash forward a decade now your last name's Guiseppi
Allegedly, runnin with those crooked nose kids
but when you turn your back they'll shoot a hole through your leg
As you skid (AARGH!) out of control on the Grand Central
You gotta call that your label would fall
If you put your, toughest, hardest, realest
MCs against me they'll turn up empty HAH
Cos they don't know nothin bout real rap skills
so there presence ain't needed for real so what the deal? Yeah
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
Hah
Now this goes to the fan that really thinks the man
behind the mic is speakin truth, but yo I got proof
There's about seventy precent of rappers who misrepresent (What?)
talkin about they'll put a dent (What?) in the game when they drop
but don't even scratch the surface, rhymin without a purpose
makes me sick to my stomach, so you suckers should stop
It's a sign of the times, a kilo ain't got nothin to do with your rhymes
A gun ain't got nothin to do with your rhymes
A blunt ain't got nothin to do with your rhymes, that's why you fall behind
So next time you braggin bout the dues you completed
Remember your presence ain't needed, now hit the hell out of here, huh yeah
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
You ain't doin nuttin for my brain
And all you rappers really sound the same
You ain't needed in the hip hop game
Motherfucker
