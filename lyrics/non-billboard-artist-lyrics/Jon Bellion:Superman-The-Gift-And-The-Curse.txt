Superman-The-Gift-And-The-Curse:Jon Bellion
[Hook 1]
Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

[Verse 1]
Your favorite rapper's be taking beats that I'm shitting up
Your favorite lyricist's tell me that I don't spit enough
10 steps ahead of you musically, how you plan to stop me?
Just count your blessings that I consider rap a fucking hobby!

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more, more, more..

[Verse 2]
Imagine locking the tone of Sarah McLachlan
The fashion of Jimi Hendrix & a box with the bible's doctrine
I look for potential wives, She looking for famous Johnson
She hungry for the Action in New York we call that Bronson

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She literally told me "you're too much of a genius
You're gonna be too famous"
She literally left me
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse (2x)


[Outro]
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse..
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse..
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse..!
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse..!
TELL ME THAT SHIT AIN'T A GIFT and A CURSE..!
