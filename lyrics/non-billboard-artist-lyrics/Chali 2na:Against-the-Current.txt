Against-the-Current:Chali 2na
Yes sir, yes sir
Testing one two
Yes sir
Haha testing one two
Tryin to get this right

Yo, I sense havoc that triggers immense panic
Convince savages with the use of intense magic
I'll prince planet your flesh against granite
The best is fish dammit the rest should just vanish
Assess damages after my clique handle shit
No comparison 2na is the best candidate
The diamond studded amulet upon this random shit
Making them abandon ship with the fresh manuscript
Yeah so I reproached the curvature
Got the game covered like reupholstered furniture
Lyrical ligatures reinvented my signature
Prehistoric methods that readjust the temperature
(In California)
Been here for the best of my years, but I won't claim the west like the rest of my peers
When they see the aggression they got me testing you kids
And the lesson is ain't nobody messing with fish it's like this.

[Chorus:]
Into the tide go in and dive down deep below with the undertoe
Will guide us straight into the light
Go up against the current,
(Up against the current) [x8]

Where my verbiage is inserted it makes your skin curdle and told us you been nervous
I leap hurdles and murder you weak turtles complete service the beat furnace these heat burners
From this deep furnace
Imbedded the chest level, when the dust settles there's an angel amongst devils
Boulder amonst pebbles
A disciplined minded soldier amongst rebels composure while others tremble I'm sayin
You can't withstand the fish man
The minute that my group switch plan it disband
Relations became abrasive like brillos and dish pans
And crumble like a tooth pick used as a kick stand it's sick fam
Although my luck seem dimmer
I'm the only 2na that's an upstream swimmer
Corrupt teens wither using hatred as a fish deterrent
So I switch when I learn shit and pushed it against the current.

[Chorus]

The way son represent it, unprecedented
Brought to your temple like it was a gun pressed against it
Coming fresher scented with an impressive sentence
And those who witness have an invested interest
Ground breaking while you clowns faking
Here to fit your face and leave your whole town shaking
I make it sound blatant cause the fish could burn it
Here to heat the ocean in one motion against the current
No fear don't hide jump in and dive
It's there below where you can grow
Decide, cause right now is the time to go up against the current
Be brave and try then you will fly above the shores and thunderstorms,
That's why right now is the time to go up against the current
(Up against the current) [x4]
