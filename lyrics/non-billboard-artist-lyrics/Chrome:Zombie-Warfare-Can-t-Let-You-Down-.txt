I feel it like a scientist
I feel it like a scientist
And you say you're face is parted and you can't be alone
You say he loves you but he didn't phone
But I can't let you down
I can't let you down
I try to get you to except the feel
That the march is on
Can't you be someone that I can't let down
Can't let you go and can't let you down
Now that you're someone you gotta go to war
You've been persuaded
Persuaded you to join
So I've got to go to war
I've got to go to war
And I can't let you down
I can't let you down
