Vibin-:Athletic Mic League
(BUFF-ONE)
Well it's the B-U-F-F dash O-N-E
Asking y'all to please get your vibe on with me

(Vitalo)
And it's the V-I-T-A-L-OOOO
Hit a vibe with y'all now and make you say hello

(14KT)
What up though, and if y'all didn't know it's me
And I go by the name of 14KT

(all)
And it's the Mic League right - right -right - right
(Showing how we vibe)


(BUFF-ONE)
You call that genius? It's more like the stroke of ignorance
And I'll be more than happy to fix those broken sentences
The only problem is (what); they're blowing in the wind
And you can't pick up the pieces cause you don't know where to begin
Start with that main organ a few inches below your chin
You hear a beaten but you don't know what coast you're listening
It says -- "Fella you must destroy
Those thoughts that got you running around like your mama don't love you boy"
I'm just keeping it real, but real to me -
Is not a real emcee but a real human being, and
We do the things that seem to get applause
It's called hip-hop, and we rockin for the cause
Not the kind of rock that fiends abuse -
The kind of rock that make your speakers move
What side you claim, you don't need to choose
We all the same, all my people groove
Cause when it's all said and done we dot the i's and cross t's
Y'all gonna know this cat they call?
Make the names household, y'all gon see
But for now just vibe with me

(Chorus)
We gon represent the Midwest even though we been goooooone
Let's rise up together, we can all stand taaaaaaall
We spent some time away, but the connection stay stroooooong
We know we owning supporters cause we be vibin off y'all

(Vitalo)
?"Your daddy plugs whites"? spit the crowd, make them participate
Improvise, its ok, you'll make mistakes
Don't blame the soundman, the DJ got breaks
Why don't you utilize the crowd and prove the vibe in this place
Hold on dog, the reason I survive this long
I'm age sported in dialog, and word delivery
Perseverance Â– that's like my greatest attribute
And saying that "I'm dope" is a lie, then I go out and smack em (come here)
The truth come out the Himalayas, with a? and a snaggle tooth
I'm takin y'all way back (WAAAAY BACK) rocking white jumpsuit abs and proof
Love or hate, y'all can take your pick
We've seen it all from plagiaristic racist hicks to O.D.'ed raver chicks
Disconnecting cables, freestyling to the fader clicks
My favorite is - leaving tour stages cause it pays the rent
The eight energetic, with eight thousand ways to spit
Thanks for the wait, yo we appreciate it

(Chorus)
Find your life is? while I recite this sooooooong
Tell your girl is fly and your kids that crime's wroooooong
We keep the dogs hype and the ladies head boooooob
The League stays in the job when we be vibin off y'all

(14KT)
Yuh yall, it goes (UH UH UH OOOOH)
Let-let me know is y'all with me (WITH MEEE)
Yo I'm ready to rock, is y'all ready to rock? (YEAH)
I'm sayin if, if y'all ready to rock then, (ahhhh...)
I might as well then
Spit my patented hype sentences to finish this
I got no choice but to take this back to genesis
With peer ethic, haggling it like Tom Chambers double-pumper Lakers vs Celtics
Y'all know the half-steady craft the raps til I hear the extra hand clap
Then see fans stack a lease the gold LP?
Back to back -- blows to sold out shows
To show that we love? master glow?
It's all for hip-hop, nothing else can match the vibe of trying to switch spots
As big as it's got, we raise it to an infinite notch
To see them arms flop Reggie Miller fight after drunk shots

(Chorus)
We go on and on and onnnnn, on and on and onnnnnn
Keep your hands to the sky, we trying to see how loooong
We stage diving, climbin speakers like King Kooooong
Yeah, gettin at shows, cause we be vibin off y'all

We go on and on and onnnnn, on and on and onnnnnn
Keep your hands to the sky, we trying to see how loooong
We stage diving, climbin speakers like King Kooooong
Yeah, gettin at shows, cause we be vibin off y'all

(Adlibs to the end)
