Circle-of-Fools:Epidemic
Reject the internal, a blind eye turned, truth denied.
Unwanted within them inflicted outwards in lies.
Aversion, denial, oppression, blame sinks to you.
The scapegoat is chosen and hunted among delusions of the few.

Panic bleeds into the brain, a high pitch from the sky.
Gripped by the instinct of fear, sirens multiply.
Convulsions to death, conform the body to flesh.
A beatless heart lying still, murdered by illusions of the mind.

Convicted, sentenced, brought to trial, extremities too far.
Exceed brought by stagnant world, time frozen, charges barred.
I blame you for corrupted youth, on your command they turned.
Bring the masses to the fold, next generation saved.

Fear dictates their sense of trust, a tightened guiding grip.
In their minds we are the weak, so easily to slip.
Eliminate temptation, a world preserved and saved.
Persecute the ones they fear, and the disarray.

What do you think entertained his mind, as he raised the gun to his =

sweat soaked brow.
Did some hypnotic rhythm reach out and fire the killing blow.
Or did his battered, scarred existence cry out for an end.
A tortured empty life that he let go.

Shock, disbelief, the crushing grief
As guilt drained their lives, their senses numb
Brought to trial can=B9t let the question lie
Court rejected, blame deflected, failed to pass the inner pain
Stagnant now, within them it resides.

What are they hoping to see, those who shield our eyes
Uniformed, marching in stride, pure personified
This world of perfection, enforce the boundaries around
Like cattle the circle of fools is lead to the moral high ground

Tension built, released the blow, outbreak of war and fear
Collective ignorance and hate directed at the near
Vandalized by fools who search for an enemy
They and those who blind our sight are the danger that they seek.
