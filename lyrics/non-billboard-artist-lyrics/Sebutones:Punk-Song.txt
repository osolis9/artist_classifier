Punk-Song:Sebutones
I've had it up to here with people that don't think
I'm sick of people asking me why I don't drink
I'm sick of wannabe DJs I'm sick of marijuana
I'm sick of the nineties I'm sick of Americana
I'm sick of indecision I'm sick of religion
I'm sick of commercial radio I'm sick of television
I'm sick of the taxes I'm sick of the weather
I'm sick of these wack MCs altogether
I'm sick of casinos and big wager tables
I'm sick of foreign policy I'm sick of major labels
I'm sick of the rednecks I'm sick of Street Fighters
I'm sick of videogames and I'm sick of beat biters
I'm sick of student loans and building bigger debts
I'm sick of fast food and I'm sick of cigarettes
I'm sick of being cold and I'm sick of being broke
And going out to a bar and breathing second-hand smoke
I'm sick of suggestions I'm sick of stupid questions
I'm sick of flat tires I'm sick of big fat liars
I'm sick of being spoonfed bleeding crossfaders
I'm fed up with the gossip I'm sick of rollerbladers
I'm sick of second place and being ripped off
I'm sick of seeing angels with their wings clipped off
I'm sick of cheap thrills and no penetration sex
If you know what I mean I'm sick of Generation X
I'm sick of the mix tapes and heroin chic
I'm sick of peoples minds that are narrow and weak
Thanks but no thanks I'm sick of the skanks
I'm sick of disease and I'm sick of the banks
I'm sick of finding hair when you're chewing your pie
I'm sick of people acting like they're still in junior high
I'm sick of the theory I'm sick of conspiracy
I'm sick of being taken for a joker too seriously
I'm sick of the helmet law I'm sick of taking risks
I'm sick of these God damned compact discs
I'm sick of baggy pants and I'm sick of tea and coffee
I'm sick of being low key and the focus being off me
I'm sick of feeling useless I'm sick of abuses
I'm sick of the red tape and I'm sick of excuses
I'm sick of certain people I'm sick of tuna casserole
I'm sick of Halifax and I'm sick of drunken assholes
