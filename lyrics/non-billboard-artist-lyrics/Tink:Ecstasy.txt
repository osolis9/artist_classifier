Ecstasy:Tink
Baby grab a pill
Tell me how's it feel
Adrenaline rising
& I know this may kill (kill)
But the pain I wanna feel (feel)
Bite my lip oh we're rolling
'Cause
You're thirsty
I'm wet
Oo tonight we'll be breaking out in sweats
It's ecstasy, when you're next to me.
Make me say oho oh

This is new to me uh
I just wanna feel your face in between ma legs
Oh I just went numb again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
'Cause I'm shaking
What is this?
Oo tonight I can't even catch my breath
It's ecstasy
When you're next to me
Make me say oho oh

No more no more (ooh oo ohh)
No more no more (no no nooo)
Baby, its so much more enticing (ticing)
I ain't never felt this horny

What do we do? What do we do? Tell me, baby, what do we do now.
So damn high (high)
So damn in love (damn in love)
What do we do? What do we do? Tell me, baby, what do we do now.

Of that ecstasy
When you next to me
Make me say oho oh oo oh
