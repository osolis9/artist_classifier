[Chorus: Dreezy]
Yo body on my body baby
Im about to catch a body in here baby
I love the way you grind on me
Said im about to catch a body in here baby
It's going down
Im about to catch a body
Oh yeah oh yeah , don't stop it now
Im about to catch a body

[Verse One: Dreezy]
Keep it a hunnid boy I know that you want it
Another round won't remember in the morning
Got on your shirt , put in that work
Until you clock out
Mike Tyson boy you know I got that knock out
Take a dive inside this liquor
Got me pulling on your zipper
He wanna hit a lick , I got my legs up like a stick up
I woke up in my glory
Keep a K with me like Kourtney
Since a shorty I been popping like a forty
End of story baby

[Verse Two: Jeremih]
You work that thang like a nine to five
Clock in to work and put in over time
I pull up on you with that thang through your back
And beat it up like ra-ta-ta-ta-tat ( lock and load it )
Got a Uzi on your booty know you popping
Clip after clip ain't got no problem with me watching

[Verse Three: Dreezy]
Ain't going home baby we could go all night (yeah)
Drop all yo hoes let me show you ima rider
Make the neighbors call the cops
Still ain't finna stop
I see these bitches tryna block
Take another shot
Bang Bang you look good boy
You could be my main thing
Rich sex, I saw your chain slang, I'm on the same thing
Might give in if you don't let up
