Jah-Bles:Klashnekoff
We live this*
Trapped in the belly of the sickness
It's sick and sadistic like six six sixes
That's arithmic I sit with a lit spliff
My hearts split into bits over big sis
Just slit her wrists and left a letter on the bed
Begging for forgiveness
That's why I writ this
You chiefs can't get it
But you can quicker then scrib's ca say bill it
Over stand (bluhd) it's deeper then lyrics
When prayers exchange chains for half of the spirit
Trapped in a maze of masquerades and mimics
It might sound 'arsh mate
But to me we're living in the last days
The same thing my pops say before he passed way
Now all I got is youths and my Mar J
So our Father, who art in heaven
Send me the will and strength of sixty henchmen

Yea, Trust, Meditate, Lion Hearts

Caus I'm pero with words, whore swords sever the verse
Ever ready with a 'chete for what ever occurs
I heard heavens on Earth
Then I reckon we're cursed
Destined to burst weapons while repping our turf
To just get left in an urse
You'll be resting with worms
Or we can converse
Keep it blessing the herbs
I move with an incredible urge to merc anything that's testing my firm
It's better they learn
