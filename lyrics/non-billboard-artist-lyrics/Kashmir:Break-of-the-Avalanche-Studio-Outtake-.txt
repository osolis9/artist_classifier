Break-of-the-Avalanche-Studio-Outtake-:Kashmir
I got a lot on my mind
and blood on my hands
Still terrified?
you wist for men
So I shivver for you
you troumble for me
I step on your shooes
I trip on your heels
But the arcangels curse
for the sins I have shoved away
Let him trumpet and roar
because I can't make it go away
Yes tomorrow lies dark
with what will become of us
Still don't know you stand
You're a watery clown
with a thundering eve
Straight path through a crowd
with a millions deceived
So if time is on your side
and love is on your mind
I wont be too hard to find
In the ludicris lights
at the break of the avalanche
at the end of the night
there's where you find me
There's so much we don't know
so much I don't need to know?
Still when tears to my back
