(Nawlage)
I'm glad that I met you girl
I'm so into you
Only if you let me girl
I'll show it to you

I know that you're afraid of love
'Cause you ain't never got it like this
I need you to change because
I ain't gon' treat you like shit
Like he did (like he did)
Or like he does (like he does)
Like he did (like he did)
Or like he does (like he does)

Although you have a man
We're conversating like you're single
And I know he gon' be mad
But you're the shawty that I'm into
I can't keep holding back when I'm with you
