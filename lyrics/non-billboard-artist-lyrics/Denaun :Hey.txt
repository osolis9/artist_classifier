Hey:Denaun 
Hey, my name's Denaun
What's up with that head girl, you changed your mind? (Uhm, yeah)
Well ain't that fine
Cause that was like a broken hourglass girl, a waste of time
I'm back - I'd like to thank my spine
For holding a nigga up, so I can't recline
I got so much credit that I can't decline
And I flip your dad's wife like she ain't your mom (What your name is?)
Denaun, nickname's 'Naun
Cooler than the [???], they call me [???]
I'm new, but I ain't new to this, love a big luteus
Especially when she nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nu-nudi-ist (Yeah)
I know the fellas is cool with this (Yeah)
Everybody love a big booty (shit)
Cause you don't want beef I got heat to retire you
You won't see it coming, like a secret admirer
The truth with the hands, I stay beating a liar up
(Ooh, I'm cooking)

(Hey!)
Back in this bitch, like a yeast infection
Put the metal to your chest, that's police protection
Got a whopper of a gun, clip your beef in seconds
You don't like what I'm saying - you can eat an erection
With a big side of balls
Couple of flavors, your bitch tried 'em all
Renovation, I rip down the walls
That's why she ain't pick up when the kids tried to call
I gave her drugs like CVS and she took all my kids like CPS
It's locker work for Nike, how we see checks
And you out here sucking dick to get your CD pressed?
Man I'm dodging all your calls like a creepy ex
This is my own planet homie, we be next!
(Bitch, he so fresh)
Yes, me is on deck
You're out here looking for a sponsor when I don't invest
You have to do more than impress me with how much of my dick you can ingest
You're a whore I detest
And I spin hoes like a BDS
