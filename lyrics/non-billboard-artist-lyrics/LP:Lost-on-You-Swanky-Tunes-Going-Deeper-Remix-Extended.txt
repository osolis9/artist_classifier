Lost-on-You-Swanky-Tunes-Going-Deeper-Remix-Extended:LP
Lost on you

When you get older,
Plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers,
Falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago

And well you know

Smoke em if you got em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
Cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass
Or two

To all the things I've lost on you
O-o
Tell me are they lost on you
O-o
Just that you could cut me loose
O-o
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you
Ooooo-oo
Is that lost on you
Ooooo-oo
Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you

Wishin' I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never
lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more
Than hate me all the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink
Of ever this can turn around
Let's raise a glass
Or two

To all the things I've lost on you
O-o
Tell me are they lost on you
O-o
Just that you could cut me loose
O-o
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you
Ooooo-oo
Is that lost on you
Ooooo-oo
Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you

Let's raise a glass
Or two

To all the things I've lost on you
O-o
Tell me are they lost on you
O-o
Trusted you could cut me loose
O-o
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you
Is that lost on you
