Calis-All-That:Def Jef
calis all that thats why im camping out here for right now
because the moneys goodplus i get to kick it with the boys in the hood
holly wood remind me of 42nd street but the cops out here want the beat
i gotta get in my car when i want to jet out and drive kinda far coz everythings so sped up
but i dont really mind i just put my top down boom my system and play my hip hop sounds
big cars and movie stars dont impress me with their wealth because im livin' kinda large myself im gettin' paper what i mean is im getting paid coolin' in cali under a palm tree shade
it aint where your from its where your at you gotta come to cali coz its all that.
california knows how to party, california knows how to party
yo im tellin you your gonna love it
tell ya boy he can take his job and shove it
go home pack your bag but leave your umbrella remember it never rains in southern california. everyday is sunny and bright but its chilly at night so take a sweater and you'll be alright
you never know who you might run into everyday somethin' new is nothing but something to do
so me and crew roll to rascoos we eat then we roll down to venice beach
we each got blunts so its all good to go hoodie bang
and a flow and you know at the beach we dont lay in the sand and get a tan we walk the strip and see the honey dips
and itsy bitsy tiney winey yellow polka dot bikini beleive me when i say cali's all that.
california knows how to party, california knows how to party, california knows how to party, california knows how to party heey.
yeah loves in the house california style
i was blazin leaves on the set side
napa vest side
by the funky funky ass west side
you and ya crew what ya gonna do
jumpin in the pool watch ya eyes they might get full of view.
and every day is smooth and kickin
and dont worry bout the women coz they love attention
i must admit its filled with cliques but the brothers on top dont deal with the bullshit
and get to the party have a sip of barcardi
be a hotty and act like its mardi gras
thas all ya lookin at what i was doing i gotta rump now you know why im barbaquing
heres a chance to unwind in the sunshine everyday you splash and take a ray
ive been all over the world and i love to come back because cali's all that.
california knows how to party, california knows how to party, california knows how to party, california knows how to party.
some people come to cali to make it
some people are phony so they run fake it
some people make it to the top so that theres no body
you see the sam e faceswhen your on the way down
when you drop pop the folk on the moab and death flowin the poet with soul lets roll
to hollywood hills for another good party you know that means crazy food and crazy hotties
not to mention the cronic sticky green
and a lay tight scene
i used to think that cali was all suckers and jelly curls
but they got some down brothers and fly girls
so when you ready to make that move
give me a ring get the next flight and friday night we can swing it
and you can see for yourself where its at come to cali coz its all that.
california knows how to party, california knows how to party, california knows how to party, california knows how to party.
