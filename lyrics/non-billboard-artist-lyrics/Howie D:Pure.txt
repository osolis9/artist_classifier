Pure:Howie D
Alright, I'm alone
And I'm feeling like I'm caught in a daze
Come through, all the more
Yeah she's going right through the haze
There are track of time as she looks into me
And her energy is pulling me closer

I don't wanna be with another face in the crowd
Because tonight I'm looking right at heaven
Let's break away, escape with me all the way
All the way to heaven
Cause it feels so good
And it feels so right
We can waste our time
Put your skin on mine
Waking up in paradise
Waking up in paradise
Waking up in paradise

We leave, we're alone
And your touch is like a chain reaction
Anything that we want
The Stacity is burning in action
Giving everything cause I know what you're worth
Not just tonight but forever

I don't wanna be with another face in the crowd
Because tonight I'm looking right at heaven
Let's break away, escape with me all the way
All the way to heaven
Cause it feels so good
And it feels so right
We can waste our time
Put your skin on mine
Waking up in paradise

Come with me girl
Just follow me
I'll take you there
won't let you, let you go
Watching you come to me
Beautiful as the sea
Watching me touching you (Come with me girl)
(Just follow me) Can't believe
(I'll take you there, won't let you, let you go)
Something's so Pure

I don't wanna be with another face in the crowd
Because tonight I'm looking right at heaven
Let's break away, escape with me all the way
All the way to heaven
Cause it feels so good
And it feels so right
We can waste our time
Put your skin on mine
Waking up in paradise
Waking up in paradise
Waking up in paradise
