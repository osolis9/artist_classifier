It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up

It's dare

You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do baby
Hold it down dare

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were dare yourself
To work it out

Never did no harm, never did no harm
It's dare

It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up
It's dare

You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down dare

Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you would dare yourself
To work it out

Never did no harm
Never did no harm

You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down dare

Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you would dare yourself
To work it out

You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down dare

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you would dare yourself
To work it out
