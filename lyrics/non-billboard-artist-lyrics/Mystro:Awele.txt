Awele:Mystro
Think i know what's going through your mind
Free yourself cos i care you know why
See my weakness right there in your smile
And never fail to recall who you are, who you are
In your arms
i can make it since we are young and this song is alright
It doesn't matter how hard we fight
as long as we remain in love we'll survive
Iku oba la nfiyawo jeru
What will i do without you
Awele
I know that you've been hurt before
Awele
I'm willing to love you more and more
You know say me and you don com a long way
Before before that time money no dey
No mind the old school love igbalode
I'm taking you down the aisle some day
In your arms i can make it
Since we are young and this song is alright
It doesn't matter how hard we fight
As long as we remain'in love we'll survive
Iku Oba la nfiyawo jeru
What will i do without you
Awele (baby)
I know that you've been hurt before
(I love you loooove) Awele
I'm willing to love you more and more

I know that you've been hurt before
Awele
I'm willing to love you more and more
