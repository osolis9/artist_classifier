We-Think-Too-Much:Lil Peep
Nobody wants to talk to me
But everyone wants to walk with me
And I always been that kid
Maybe I won't be if I live long enough
But I think imma die now
I just keep it to myself and try not to cry too loud
I just wanna lay my head on your chest so I'm as close as it gets to your heart
We can fall apart
Start over again
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows one thing about me
Everyone doubts me
But Imma make it all come true
And I do it for you
I know all about the pain that you go through
