Flowers:Yancey Boys
Ok, ok, alright, I'mma get it tight
It's only right, it's me and you
And I would never underestimate the things that you've been through
Ring around what I do, steady getting played
You laying the wedding plans, he planning on getting laid
So hi, how you doing? How your momma doing? Nice to meet you
Seems like you need a mil', I would like to treat you
And we can discuss the wrong and the right way
Or we can get smashed off Hennessey and OJ
Ok, I'm taking off your Dolce Gabbana and I ain't even asked
Don't mean I don't wanna start in the bed, end up in the shower
But first let me give you these flowers

You give me flowers
Lying in the arms of the man that power my high
As sweet as my eyes, another land, like a spiral in my eyes
You give me flowers and loving lullabies made up of the sky
And every hour of the day or of the night I can spiral out my life
You give me flowers, you give me flowers

The most powerful with this flower but devour me by the hour
Got me open, got me zoning, she smoking me like a sour
I'm hoping to give a doer, honor her with the mula
For dating and making rumors to baby showers and dulas
Consuming with my passion, she match it, it's so special
Wherever she take a step she getting showered with rose petals
I'm a king ', black Don Quixote, swinging like' on my Mr. Belafonte
My crew would die to inspire Fante and Big Crew, the way my bella move'
I love your fragrances plus your blush touch my favorite
Vanessa Williams on a poster in my mother's basement

You give me flowers
Lying in the arms of the man that power my high
As sweet as my eyes, another land, like a spiral in my eyes
You give me flowers and loving lullabies made up of the sky
And every hour of the day or of the night I can spiral out my life
You give me flowers, you give me flowers

Yeah, baby, flower, 'cause I touch your powers
So I sign my ' 'cause I want you to feel mine, flexing to the side
You a love concoction, you feel the energy and so do I
But only I keep it real, I wanna be your only guy
And I'm cool we can't be homies but I just wanna be your homie
'Cause I'm home alone and I think you're the perfect person for me, though
We have amazing chemistry but you ' 'cause I can't say what it feels
You know I'm keeping it real 'once my feeling reveal
So that's why I sent you flowers with this letter sealed 'love, John'

You give me flowers
Lying in the arms of the man that power my high
As sweet as my eyes, another land, like a spiral in my eyes
You give me flowers and loving lullabies made up of the sky
And every hour of the day or of the night I can spiral out my life
You give me flowers, you give me flowers
