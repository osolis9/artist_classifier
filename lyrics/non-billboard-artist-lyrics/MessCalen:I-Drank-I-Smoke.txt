I-Drank-I-Smoke:MessCalen
[Verse 1:]
I ain't no Hollywood ass nigga, I ride through the Town
Like nigga who got that white, homey who got that brown?
I'm a solid, nigga I don't fuck around
Muh'fuckers love how I get down
Thirty-four, did my time up in Rita
Had a bitch but I really didn't need her
Niggaz youger than me hittin Quentin
I'm on the phone nigga poppin my pimpin
Me and my West Oakland niggaz gon spread
Do my calistetics 'for I go to bed
Who got the weed nigga? holla at your folks
I drank and nigga I smoke
[Hook: x2]
I drank, I smoke
And I'll put these thangs on your folks
I'll put these thangs on your folks
Nigga I'll put these thangs on your folks
[Verse 2:]
Fo' in the mornin, nigga hittin ki's
Talkin bout breakfast, white boy please
I'm from the block, I sleep 'til two
Betch you don't tell that bitch what to do
I paid a lawyer, my case look sweet

These niggaz hoes be outta pocket on a visit
Soon as he turn around she shootin me the digits
Damn homey, these bitches ain't shit
Soon as I touch down ahe gon suck my dick
Who got that other shit? holla at your folks
I drank and nigga I smoke
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3:]
Yeah nigga, its been a while since I went to court
Nigga sayin anything, cause they know I'm short
I'ma sit and read this dutch for about hour
And play some dominoes, when I hop up out the shower
Locked down, runnin a million dollar operation
It's all good, I done did this on vacation
David Banner and model chicks shootin me kites
My nigga Tay from the bottom was shootin me lice
Niggaz on the phone talkin bout the same shit
He say he pimpin but he talkin to the same bitch
Who got that pruno? holla at your fuckin folks
I drank and nigga I smoke
[Hook x2]
