Fein:Doja Clik
I can't sing like David
I can't preach like Paul
I'm not strong like Samson
I ain't nothing at all.
I can't form great miracles
And turn the water into wine.
But I can preach and sing about Jesus
I'm His and He is mine.

I'm His (I'm His and He is mine)
He's mine (I'm His and He is mine)
As long as I'm singing about Jesus I'm satisfied.
I'm His (I'm His and He is mine)
He's mine (I'm His and He is mine)
As long as I'm singing about Jesus I'm satisfied.

I can't take three loaves of fishes and feed five thousand men
I can't touch those blinded eyes and make them see again.
I can't walk upon the waters and I can't fly through the air.
But when old Gabriel blows his trumpet I know I'm gonna be there.

I'm His (I'm His and He is mine)
He's mine (I'm His and He is mine)
As long as I'm singing about Jesus I'm satisfied.
I'm His (I'm His and He is mine)
He's mine (I'm His and He is mine)
As long as I'm singing about Jesus I'm satisfied.

I'm His (I'm His and He is mine)
He's mine (I'm His and He is mine)
As long as I'm singing about Jesus I'm satisfied.
I'm His (I'm His and He is mine)
He's mine (I'm His and He is mine)
As long as I'm singing about Jesus I'm satisfied.
