On-The-Eve-Of-War:Jedi Mind Tricks
This is raw, all across the board, Liquid Sword Chamber
If it's coming from my jaw, then it's pure anger
Heavy metal rap, with a 44 banger
We can settle that, let the mic cord hang ya

I pay homage to the best of them, like Christopher Wallace
And bring drama to the rest of 'em, with biscuits from coppers
I'm with the Lord-Justice, and we raw gritty
Picture hell, Philadelphia to New York City

I brought a four with me, we can capture the ring
And now we more merciless than the Statue of Ming
And y'all are more purposeless than a pacifist king
You gonna die, like a brawl with a gat in the Bing

It's a passionate thing, the way we make classics
Genuine brilliance or innate madness, yeah
We all spin on the same axis
And this chrome thing here leave your frame backless

The police always trying to aim flame at us
So I don't mind when a pig brain splatters
I don't mind that we all gonna die soon
I return to the silence of God's tomb

Yeah, Vinnie Paz baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

There is no escaping once my blade start scraping
My sword indeed make more niggaz bleed
Wannabe of the MC's is shaken
So swift naked eye couldn't record the speed

There is no escaping once my blade start scraping
My sword indeed make more niggaz bleed
Wannabe of the MC's is shaken
So swift naked eye couldn't record the speed

I don't believe what I'm seeing, I don't believe it
Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we have
to gonna please rise
(You'll never quit)
No one will ever get it, there's no thing quit

Imagine a rhyme in it's prime from off the baseline
Skyscraper a vertical support the hang time
Evidence that was left at the scene of the crime
Trace back to a few from outta group of nine

Who performed well regardless to the price of the ticket
Off or on stage whatever still kickin'
With the footwork of Freddy Adu, it's all new
Now the rap commissioners, they wanna clone my shoe

With the rose now and its difficult to climb
With the heat and wind and fallen rocks combined
It's hard to stay aliened the course is an obstacle
Within each chamber the force it unstoppable

Lyrical swordsman blaze sharp, I'll cut out your heart
MC's want no part of any type of conflict
Be 'cuz when I respond quick, it gets thick
The problem goes beyond sick

Wearin' red trunks with silver trim
Fightin' outta Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
This is how we do it
His game is tight and there's nothing to do

I ain't shaking but I gotta have skill spin
What's the deal, baby? GZA, Genius
Got the chance in life to redeem myself

Stoups on the track, yeah my man Soop on the boards
Those who dare oppose us shall stand
Knee deep in the blood of their children
Is that he who follows the pleasure of Allah

Like him who has made himself deserving
The displeasure from Allah
And his abode and hell
And it is an evil destination
