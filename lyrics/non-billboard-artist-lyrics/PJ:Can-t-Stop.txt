Can-t-Stop:PJ
[Intro]
Alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm not going get out of bed until I feel like it
I ain't go to sleep 'til 5 am
You take a shot while you can
Because it's cold out here
You might not have to get that shot again
[Pre-Chorus]
Ok, we on the road to better things
Because we drove all night
Why don't you tell them every hater you know
We gon' do more than get by

[Chorus]
Won't you tell them that
I can't stop, no, I never won't stop
Why don't tell them that
I can't stop, no no no, I won't stop

[Verse 2]
They used to look at me wrong
Since I was a little, I guess
For me, it's kinda like it's just tradition
For you to say no, just like the last ones did
But what's [?] our position?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ok, we on the road to better things
Because we drove all night
Why don't you tell them every hater you know
We gon' do more than get by

[Chorus]
Won't you tell them that
I can't stop, no no no, I won't stop
Why don't tell them that
I can't stop, no no no, I won't stop

[Post-Chorus]
Not even when they fed up
You can do much, you can do nothing
Not my [?], love
On everything, I'm tryna tell 'em that
I can't stop, no, a nigga won't stop
I can't stop, no no no, I won't stop

[Bridge]
I'm on the road like it feeling now
Been on the rose, but I was gave up and knocked out
Look at the glass from the ceiling down
Been on the rose, but I was gave up and knocked out
I'm on the road like it feeling now
Been on the rose, but I was gave up and knocked out
Look at the glass from the ceiling down
Been on the rose, but I was gave up and knocked out

[Outro]
I can't stop, no no no, I won't stop
Why don't tell them that
I can't stop, no, a nigga won't stop
Okay, we on the road to better things
Because we drove all night
Why don't you tell them every hater you know
We gon' do more than get by
