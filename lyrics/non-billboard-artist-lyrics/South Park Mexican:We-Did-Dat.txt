We-Did-Dat:South Park Mexican
We did dat, we did dat
We did dat, we did dat
We did dat, we did dat
We did dat, we did dat, we did dat

Ain't no cappin' when I'm rappin'
I'm all 'bout dividends, pull up in a bigger Benz
I know you feel adrenaline
Don't be mad cause ya man made it

Ya ain't dedicated
If I'm speakin' anotha language than let me translate it
It was early in the mornin', repos got the Volvos
Now I'm standin' at my door, smokin' them Marlboros

Thinkin' my lights be out tomorrow
And I can't beg or borrow
So if you ain't from our side
It's day one of that horror

Now get in where I fit in, sit down and listen
I hate startin' from the bottom but hea go the new mission
When I'm in too deep I don't believe my shit stank
No if's, and's or cant's to get back to my old rank

Can I turn into a robber? Cock back revolver
Takin' what you got than I'm hittin' for the border
CD's, tapes, stereos, here we go
Droppin' 16 in the studio but ya don't hear me though

Overloaded Wells Fargo, we did dat
4000 at the car show, we did dat
Dope House Records is my studio, we did dat
Houston Hard Hittas video, we did dat

I think like McGiver just to figure things out
I got these million dolla hands that'll outlast Boy Scouts
Now when I'm gone off dat drank I move slower than molasses
Smart like Urkel without the glasses

Now undastand how da game go
It's the same ol' same ol'
Make the crowd dangle
Than shine like a rainbow

Take it there, bring it here
'Cause they ain't no damn stallin'
You put it down
We pick it up 'cause together nigga we ballin'

We ballin' all the time
Grippin' cnady, leavin' stains
My roof popped up
Now my trunk doin' the same

And you ask why these bitches wanna ride wit me
'Cause I done did that Bently
Street smarts is in me, Da Genius baby

I'm the nigga that approve yo credit
I'm dat situation that get drastic if you let it
So if you been there and done that
We da niggas that did dat
Bezatines and baggets, yellow hoes and flaggets

Overloaded Wells Fargo, we did dat
4000 at the car show, we did dat
Dope House Records is my studio, we did dat
Houston Hard Hittas video, we did dat

Speed racer be the name destroy the rap game
Dividends and Benjamins
Constant flow on pocket change
Got a nigga facin' fame

Smokin' weedies to ease the pain
Tuck yo shit in or get put to shame
My whole click shine, we bling and blang
H-Town chop and swang, grab yo bitch she feel me maan

She see a playa ballin' givin' thanks
If you say I did dat than I did the same
Huh? What? Yeah

Lean harder than the Eiffel Tower, we did dat
Flip the big bird and pop my coller, we did dat
Now you know bout the Joel Cormona, we did dat
We da shit? Do you smell the aroma? We did dat

Spittin' game on tracks for stacks, we did dat
Can't fold my wallet cause that bitch sittin' fat, we did dat
You want ya shorty you can have her back, we did dat
Calm ya nerves and blow yaself a sack, we did dat

Introduce blacks and whites to chromes, we did dat
Boy, we did dat
