Catch-The-Sun:Bloodline
Don’t make a move, don’t make a sound
This whole sky is falling down
Into the beauty we once found
And when the tide comes rushing in
It comes to wash away our sins
So the next dance can begin

And so the story goes
There’s a rhythm for us all
Somewhere
But heaven knows 
What this dream is all about
And there’s a dance for the unknown
Though they will never dance
And they can never know
Until they find what they have lost
And as confusion grows
The prisoner of illusion knows
The many ties
That compromise
And binds the truth in lies
And there’s a dance for the unseen
Though they can never dance
And they will never see
Until they know what they believe

When a thousand tears have ceased
And spirits are released
And everything lies broken on the floor
Maybe we will dance again
Who knows?
I don’t want to see the future anymore

No more

And so the words are told
There’s a reason for us all
It seems
But heaven knows
What this game is all about
And there’s a dance for the unheard
Though they can never dance
And they will never hear
Until they listen to their heart
And as confusion grows
The prisoner of illusion knows
The many ties
That compromise
And binds the truth in lies
And there’s a dance for the unloved
Though we will never dance
And we can never love
Will we know what we have lost?

And when the tide comes rushing in
It comes to wash away our sins
And leaves our stones upon the shore
Maybe we will dance again
Who knows?
I don’t want to see the future anymore

No more

When skies are falling
Through the visions and the pain
This dance will never be the same
Though skies are falling
And I can’t escape the rain
Maybe tomorrow we’ll catch the sun and dance again
