Slug:
It's the caffeine, the nicotine, the milligrams of tar,
It's my habitat, it needs to be cleaned, it's my car,
It's the fast talk they use to abuse and feed my brain,
It's the catbox, it needs to be changed, it's the pain, it's women,
It's the plight for power, it's government,
It's the way you're given knowledge slow with thought control and subtle hints,
It's rubbing it, itching it, it's applying cream,
It's the foreigners sight-seeing with high beams, it's in my dreams,

It's the monsters that I conjure, it's the marijuana
It's the embarassment, displacement, it's where I wander, it's my genre,
It's Madonna's videos, it's game shows,
It's cheap liquor, blunts, it's bumper stickers with rainbows,
It's angels, demons, gods, it's the white devils,
It's the monitor, the soundman, it's the motherfucking mic levels,
It's gas fumes, fast food, Tommy Hil, mommy's pill,
Columbia House music club, designer drugs and rhyming thugs

It's Bloods, Crips, Fives, Six, it's stick-up kids
It's Christian conservative terrorists, it's porno flicks
It's the East coast-- no, it's the West coast,
It's public schools, it's asbestos, it's mentholated, it's techno
It's sleep, life and death, it's speed, coke and meth,
It's hay fever, pain relievers, oral sex and smoker's breath,
It stretches for as far as the eye can see,
It's reality-- fuck it, it's everything but me.

On, and on, and on, and on...
The list goes on, and on, and on, and on...
The list goes on, and on, and on, and on...
The list goes on, and on, and on, and on...

Slug:
It's in the water, it's in the air, it's in the meat,
It's indirect, it's indiscrete, it's inconsistent, it's incomplete,
It's in the streets - every city, everywhere you go,
In every man it's the insanity, the fantasies, the casualties,
It's the health care system, it's welfare victims,
It's assault weapons, it's television religion and its false lessons,
It's cops, police, pigs with badges, guns and sticks,
It's harassment, and a complex that you carry when you're running shit,

It's wondering if you get to eat, it's the heat,
It's the winter, the weather, it's herpes, and it's forever,
It's the virus that takes the lives of the weak and the strong,
It's the drama that keeps on between me and my seed's mom,
It's the need to speak long, it's that hunger for attention,
It's the wack who attack songs of redemption, it's prevention,
It's the first solution, it's loose, it's out for retribution,
It's mental pollution and public execution,

It's the nails that keep my hands and feet to these boards,
It's the part-time job that governs what you can afford,
It's the fear, it's the fake, it's clear it can make time stop
And leave you stranded in the year of the snake,
It's the dollar, yen, pound, it's all denominations,
It's hourly wages for your professional observations,
It's on your face and it's in you eyes, everything you be,
'Cause it ain't me, motherfucker, 'cause it ain't me, huh

On, and on, and on, and on...
The list goes on, and on, and on, and on...
The list goes on, and on, and on, and on...
The list goes on, and on, and on, and on...
