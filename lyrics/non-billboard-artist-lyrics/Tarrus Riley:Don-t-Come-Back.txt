Don-t-Come-Back:Tarrus Riley
If you feel like you have me wrapped up
around yo likkle finger
Your wrong
And everybody feel as if a you lick mi chip
And am program to you
Think a you alone can love mi
And |I'll be broken if you walk out
But anytime you decide fi pack up you
things and leave
Don't come back
Gwaan, go
Don't come back
I wont cry
I'll be fine
Don't come back
Don't come back
Nuh bother meck the door reach you when
the good lord
Don't come back
(2)
But life is real
This love is gone toxic
No need to play any games anymore
Your kind a loving a nuh loving to me
Drifting oh we're drifting
Remember when we were one
This ship is sinking
If we tumble out we're gonna drown
My cup is overflowing
I've got enough now
