Circe-Jazzanova-mix-:Ursula Rucker
I've watched you for so long
I must have you
Sirens have nothing on my song
My song is ageless and perfect
Angels envy my song
You must be strong
To resist this
I've seduced men you thought were myth
Gods have murdered mortals over me
They died with my name on their lips
My taste on their tongues
My love is the only one
You need

Come rest your earthly burdens on my breasts
You'll find them firm like virgin
Irresistible, like Goddess
My breasts are filled with Neptune's nectar
One sip and you'll be mine

Now sink into my sea soft skin where your fantasy begins
Don't fight, you'll never win
I know my hair is mesmerizing
It reflects the colours of sun's rising
And set
You'll never forget my wet
Wonder
Come under, my kiss will keep you safe
What seem to you like minutes in my world are endless days
Ride my waves of pleasure
Forever
