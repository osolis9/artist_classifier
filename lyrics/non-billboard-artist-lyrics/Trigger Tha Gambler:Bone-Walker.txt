West Side Baby 
Performed by T-Bone Walker 

I've got a west side baby 
She lives way across town 

*I've got a west side baby 
She lives way across town 
And when I'm with my baby 
I don't want a soul around 

Now she's kind of tall and legged 
She's always dressed swell 
She sets my soul on fire 
When she rang my front door bell 

(Repeat *) 

Now Monday morning early 
Someone bang upon my door 
I knew it wasn't my baby 
'Cuz she's never knocked before 

So I lay in bed and wondered 
Wno could the caller be 
I thought it was insurance man 
'Cuz he's been hurting for me 

Crazy about my west side baby 
She lives way across town 
And when I'm with my baby 
I don't want a soul around
