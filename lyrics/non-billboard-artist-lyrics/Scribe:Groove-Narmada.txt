Groove-Narmada:Scribe
We hope that we ever face, never fall; clever traipse to higher ground.
Together fire, together weep, together wail, together watch, forever now this medicinal light veil ablaze.
We pray that we give or take; or sell our soul to breathe again.
Together tire, together sleep, together sow, together watch forever now this perennial fire-god awake.

Forever fall, whoever did, we never will - wading back alone
Who'd ever cry, to sever now, forever will - turning back once more.

You'd never fly, forever now, whenever this - sinks into my bones
If we're ever dead, whoever now, but never is - Who would ever know?

Your wings they'll never soar. Wear the cloak of neverwhere, you're ready. You're already spoken for, desecrated now, you'll never fly.

You'll never fly.
