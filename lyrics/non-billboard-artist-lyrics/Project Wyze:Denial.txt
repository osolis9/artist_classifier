Denial
I remember the time when I was a little child
My father wouldn’t call or visit
He denied the fact that I even existed
He can’t deny the fact that I’m grown up strong and artistic
You can’t deny the fact that some of us are born different
You can’t deny the fact that your life can be gone in an instant
You can’t deny that fact that your wife left you
You can’t deny that fact somebody’s out to get you
I’ve seen so many things, so many times, so many people
So many lies, so many ways to deny
The fact that you love, the fact that you hate
The fact that you try to escape problems
The fact that you got ‘em
I’m willing to lose, I’m willing to bet
I’m willing to try and die for respect
But if I have to
I’ll break it down for you and spell it out like a child
It seems everybody’s in denial

[Chorus]
You can’t deny
You can’t deny
You can’t deny what the truth is
Truth is
You can’t hold on to what you don’t know
So, let, let, it, it, go
You can’t deny
You can’t deny
You can’t deny what the truth is
Truth is
You can’t hold on to what you don’t know
So, let, let, it, it, go

You can’t deny the fact that your past haunts you
You can’t deny the fact that your girlfriend doesn’t want you
You can’t deny the fact that your life’s been shifted
You can’t deny the fact that I’m god gifted
You can’t deny the fact that everyone’s against you
You can’t deny the fact that your mortgage and rent is due
You can’t deny that fact that you’re falling apart slowly
You can’t deny you’re depressed, stressed and lonely
If only you can see what I see, you’d feel the same
Denial’s a game it only takes one to play
You’re lying, denying and everything seems strange
You can’t deny the fact that things change
For those who came to play the game
For those who called my name, for those who feel pain
I tried to live, I tried to die, I tried to stand strong, I’ve tried to cry
Now somehow someway I plan to stay, I plan to play
I look to pray, my feelings won’t go away
You can’t handle the truth when you’re acting like a child
You’re still lost in denial

[Chorus]

You borrow the keys to your girlfriends ride
You find another man’s ring on the passengers’ side
You thought you kept her happy with the money you spent
You see them holding hands and you still think they’re friends
So sick of these bands that demand respect
You can count on one hand all the fans they get
So who’s the band that electrified your stages
You can’t deny the fact that we’re headed for greatness

[Chorus]
