So-Vicious:DJ Envy
Yeah, gilla nigga in the house nigga
Oh shit, yo, DJ Envy in the house nigga

You are so, vicious
I know you're vicious

Aiyyo dog, you gotta be a gilla nigga, to roll with us
A camp full of hardhitters, with no quitters
Smackin' the shit out gold diggers when the dough mentioned
Take out a new nigga rap, with a old symptom
Yeah, I'm Doctor Dude from, "Malpractice"
Half you rappers ain't on crack, you just crackers
And backwards, I was forward when I wrote it
So when I spit I'll chip a few niggaz shoulders

I want dough, you're only penny like bologna
Haters watch y'all know they Envy, when the song bump
Talkin' 'bout they in the hood, where they hardly found
The whole hood got my number, call me now
I ain't gon' read your palm, I know your future
Only thing I need was the street you're on
Now parked on your lawn is, two Denalis
Niggaz squattin' with gloves and, Bruno Malis

New York and Cali, we don't play fair
If it's thick we rob chicks for they J-Lo wear
Give it to they baby moms, and say it's a gift
'Cause when I ball in my palm, I'ma play it to win, c'mon

You are so, vicious
I know you're vicious
You are so vicious
I know you're vicious

I gotta, watch where I'm goin', start goin' where I watch
It's summertime, but it's like snowin' in my watch
Check the funk Doc, the Lyor Cohen of the block
2020 Benz unfoldin' out the box
Futuristic kid, fuck if your team holdin'
I'm shittin' on y'all and I ain't begin to clean colony
I'll snatch the crown from whatever king holdin'
The unforgettable, Nat King Flow'n

Jack the rapper, like a conference
I'm passin' out demo tapes with shotties under the armpits
Tellin' you to listen to it, or you die young
My music like ecstacy, ever try one?
Throw your guns, it's a law to bein' men
And I'm that all day, like the war on CNN
I turn your day to short, make the night go long
I got Doug E. sayin', "Reggie, on the mic, you're on"

You are so, vicious
I know you're vicious
You are so vicious
I know you're vicious

You are so, vicious
I know you're vicious
You are so vicious
I know you're vicious
