You-Must-Learn-Greenhouse-Effect:Greenhouse Effect
[** feat. Jakki the Motomouth:]


[Verse 1: ~Manifest~]
Most time's ? changes*
It's hard to think straight
I struggle with humbleness to become great, yes Fest is me
Take it or leave
Got to get it to receive it
We always say it but do we really mean it?
When the concern for self goes beyond the concern for health
I'm no better than the next man in my pursuit of wealth
And this desire is a part of me
And I got a have it when life decide to charge a fee
Understand, until I'm comfortable, it's all about Fest
Scheme after scheme, my mind will never rest
With a ? burden I hold dear
But I'm way too bold or proud to show fear
Not that rap is an answer but it damn sure helps
To deal
React when more hands are dealt
And there's
No doubt in my mind I'll survive it
It just may not be when I'm alive, think about it
Never stop movin' up, pushin' on
I aim to be appreciated before I'm gone
Hit the lab everyday, try to write, compose the perfect song
I want the worlds to move a world, for that can I be wrong?

[Chorus: ~Blueprint~]
Life is turmoil from start to finish
Forget to watch your back, you'll be quick to get it
Then every turn you take, will be a turn for the worst
You. Must. Learn
This rap music is a part of me
No different than an arm you see
Keep swords sharpened
Radar on for targetin'
You. Must. Learn

[Verse 2: ~Blueprint~]
Something's wrong
With the way that we live
These gas prices make me wanna stay in the crib
It ain't my fault, it's something that the president did
It's dangerous now, you even go play with your kids
These terrorist's is wild
Flyin' planes into shit
So what's next?
I heard they wanna take out a bridge
Paybacks a bitch
And America's got it comin' 
What comes around goes around
You can't run from it
Can't fly, can't walk, can't drive your car
Won't bend, won't budge, won't fight in the war
I'll pull a Cashius Clay
Before you ever see me enlisted
Cause nobody Arabic ever called me a "nigger"
Or made my people live their lives out in fucked up conditions
Looked upon suspicious cause the color that their skin is
But in these other countries it don't make a difference
Cause television got 'em thinkin' all Americans is ignorant
Meanwhile
Back at the ranch
I try to stay out the grasp
Of the unseen hand
Constructing plans to touch these fans
The thing I know I can control is if my music got soul
The Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth
The positions of the rich and poor will be reversed
And I believe that to be true for what it's worth
Cause the terrorists is takin' out the rich people first

[Chorus: ~Blueprint~]
Life is turmoil from start to finish
Forget to watch your back, you'll be quick to get it
Then every turn you take, will be a turn for the worst
You. Must. Learn
This rap music is a part of me
No different than an arm you see
Keep swords sharpened
Radar on for targetin'
You. Must. Learn

[Verse 3: ~Jakki the Motomouth~]
I look around
And all I see is war, disease and hate
Still wonderin' what we tryin' to achieve in space
Tryin' to settle in a spot I can't breathe awake
Ain't even been to Cali yet, why should I leave this place?
For another planet or station
I watch how our secret government panic the nation
A scheme with fake
Terrorist plots
You don't have to care if you not concerned
Don't mind me
You cattle, you don't got to learn
I got concerned when 9-11 came and went
The Pentagon was hit but never showed a plane and since
Then, I never showed the same resentment
You'll never know the pain I live with
I never display it
Only He's who's higher than me knows what's goin' on inside of my soul
And that's who it's gonna stay with
We on high alert, I know why now
Cause there's terrorists in our country 
And a lot of 'em in the white house {*echoes*}
