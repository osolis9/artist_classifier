One-Day-Remix-:Matisyahu
[** feat. Akon:]


Akon... Matisyahu

See everybody that's existing
Got a mind of their own
We're all Kings and Queens
With a throne of our own
Tryin to raise a family
Is an? home
We got to learn to stick together
Hate to be here alone
Cause the world is a place
That will eat you alive in one day
Said the world is a place
That you can't survive without faith

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
Because

[Chorus:]
All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day (one day) {6x}

It's not about
Win or lose
We all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent
Blood drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the waters stay raging
In this maze you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy
But don't let it faze you no way (no way)

Gotta hold on
Livin life day by day
Gotta hold on
Put your focus on that one day

[Repeat Chorus:]

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence
Down with the hate
One day we'll all be free
And proud to be
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like

Gotta hold on
Livin life day by day
Gotta hold on
Put your focus on that one day

[Repeat Chorus:]
