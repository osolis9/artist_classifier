Rob-My-Plug:Fredo Santana
Im bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks then speed it to my town
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks then speed it to my town
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug, my plug
Trapper of the year bitch I cant stop, transtop
Weed so stanky, you can smell it through the pack
In the pot, then I bag it in the plastic
Cracks doing numbers, plug I say I got magic
But if you run upon me, then its gonna be a tragic
Them bullets get to flag, couple bodies in the casket
A fiend for that money, man I swear Im an addict
Whatever is set when I see it I just grab it
The 30 that I pack it rob me, it aint happen
Now you wanna news from this 40 that Im blasting
My plug he be textin, but Ima set him up
Have them killers at his house
Whoever they see, they wear nothing
Im bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks then speed it to my town
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks then speed it to my town
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug, my plug
My trap dont slow up, grind till they stop up
Hop out nigga, we aint serving less you car part
Bitches see me star struck,
Niggas wanna play tough, acting like they won war
They care to tell your face...
Last we rob the kush man, this we rob the dope man
Hear you hold that work man, get your ass poke fam
Thinking this a joke fam, then I kick your door in
Everybody on the ground, ball out bring them ropes in
Kush smoke, kush smoke, all I do is kush smoke
Disrespect my set, then you fuck around and get smoked
Gamble with your life, ask my shooters what they hitting for
Fat ass niggas, snitchin givin info
Im bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks then speed it to my town
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks then speed it to my town
Im bout to rob my plug
Im bout to rob my plug, my plug.
