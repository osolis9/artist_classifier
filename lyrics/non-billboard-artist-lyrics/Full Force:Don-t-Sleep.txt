Don-t-Sleep:Full Force
And the phone, it rings without a pulse
But I can't wait, I can't wait for the truth
Cause I know it won't come from your lips
And the sound it, makes its way down through the hall
And into my, and into my room,
And I don't know what to do
Cause I can't wait, I can't wait for the truth

Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound tonight
(Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound)
Cause the town still sleeps
The same with you away

Don't wake, don't drown the thoughts you like
(Don't wake, don't drown your thoughts)
Because everything is fine without you

And I finally found the nerve to hear your falsies,
A game of pulses racing over and over again
(Over and over again) Over and over again.
She said, "I won't begin to ask you why you're leaving,
Why you did those things you did.
Why you said those things you said."

Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound tonight
(Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound)
Cause the town still sleeps
The same with you away

Don't wake, don't drown the thoughts you like
(Don't wake, don't drown your thoughts)
Because everything is fine without you

And your lights go out,
Yeah, the air's so much easier to breathe
And my last farewell to you
Might as well be said right here, right now

Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound tonight
(Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound)
Cause the town still sleeps
The same with you away

Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound tonight
(Don't sleep, don't sleep so sound)
Because everything is fine without you.
