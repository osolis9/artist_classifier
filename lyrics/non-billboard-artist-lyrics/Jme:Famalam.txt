Famalam:Jme
Bad-boy tunes, sick lyrics, words and chords
I don't smoke herbs, outside parked up next to the curb
I got a matte black suped-up turbs
Full time, private plane, race and win
Walls and rims, I used to cotch it in Tatums and Pimms
Now I jam in a recliner ting, yeah
Bad-boy whip, soon I'm gonna have a bad-boy yard
What, say somethin', say somethin', I big up my chest
I say I'm the best, 'cause mans been doing this ting from way back when I used to wear two-string vest

Trust me Famalam, mash up the whole party when I land
Don't try come clash me badaman, you must'a had Jack Dee's anagram
Trust me Famalam, mash up the whole party when I land
Don't try come clash me badaman, you must'a had Jack Dee's anagram

Deep bass, bad-boy bars, lights and mics, crowds and hype
Skep's on the left, Frisco on the right, trust me you don't wanna fight
Full squad, big man ting, champs and glass, triple A pass, let one stager mash up the dance
One hand in the air like you're in class, yeah, Boy Better Know, soon I'm gonna have a whole net ting
Business man with a bad-boy flow, and I get all my P from Grime, cha-ching
Safe, speak up, speak up, I big up my chest, I say I'm the best
'Cause mans been doing this ting from I used to play Street Fighter 2 on the SNES

Trust me Famalam, mash up the whole party when I land
Don't try come clash me badaman, you must'a had Jack Dee's anagram
Trust me Famalam, mash up the whole party when I land
Don't try come clash me badaman, you must'a had Jack Dee's anagram

Trust me Famalam, mash up the whole party when I land
Don't try come clash me badaman, you must'a had Jack Dee's anagram
Trust me Famalam, mash up the whole part when I land
Don't try come clash me badaman, you must'a had Jack Dee's...

Okay, you wanna look in my boat, fine, you're through reason I wrote this rhyme
Yo man a baders, man a badman, man I ain't seen a 5 pound note in time
Yo, you can't diss a friend of mine, trust me, you don't wanna cross this line
Don't think you can stand in the background of the video ad-libbing next mans rhyme
Slap, do you think I'm dumb, tried to boy me, nah that can't run, yo you're lucky
The old JME, bun at you just like Jamaican rum, 'cause you got your name in your Nike Air Dunks
'Cause you got your name on your Air Force ones, you can have your name on your Reebok Pumps
Don't think you can ever diss man once, Serious
