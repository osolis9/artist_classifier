Robbery:Guilty Simpson
For real man, as long as I got that thing man I'll never be broke, for real
These motherfuckers all around here eatin' good
God forbid if I got to strong arm to take some
From one of these niggas but if I got to
That's what the fuck I'ma do for real

My loot's like Dave Chappelle
Funny as hell, money is frail
Pockets on E and a broke ass nigga I'm not gon' be
That's why I keep a glock on me

You ain't gotta believe I pop a gun
But when I'm roamin' in your residence cockin' one
You better give me that, I said give me that
Can't stop when I come like a Jimmy hat

Word on the streets is you make a good knot
And I don't give a fuck about the neighborhood watch
I'm comin' in your pet shop, pass the word
Yeah, family get cash for birds

And I'm there to take that cheese
I got manners I still say please
Please tell me all of you know
I want cocaine, weed, ice and all your dough
Now where it at y'all?

If my stomach's growlin'
Catch me in at your next function prowlin'
Somethin' like the players ball
But in the background I play the wall

Everybody all drunk and messed up
Motherfuckers lookin' all clean and dressed up
Niggas got cash for sho
'Cause everywhere I look a nigga flashin' dough

Tryin' to get attention from a nasty hoe
Perfect victims for my grab and go
And when they leave that's my queue
I don't give a fuck I'll rob your bitch too

Creepin' on your Cadillac truck
If you wanna live give your Cadillac up
And I mean quick and fast
Soon as I get the cash I hit the gas
