Jugal:Scribe
Inadvertently,
I might say once again that I could never really know how to veto control anyway, oh!
Everyday for another day, another light, another phase or another season.
Cos y'know what a waste of time that would be!
I could just keep it inside under a chest made up entirely of your lies and resilience.
Still I'd feel a pin prick in my chest cos they would round up at your nesting ground and eat your heart for a snack.
You oughta known when you killed me, this soul it has been me.
Remember, you'd seen me.
Well, now here I am once again.
Consequently, I might add once again that you would never even know how to dupe the fool, and mount the mule oh!
Yet again, you would let her in for a evening of wine and Cheetos.
And perhaps a little sodomy?
We could just keep it inside under a trunk made up entirely of your truth and emancipations, oh!
Although, we'd have to taste the ash when we eat their souls cos they'd dig our graves to burn the fuck out of us!
I mighta known it was still me, this world is within me.
Remember, you'd seen me.
Well, now here is all that remains.
