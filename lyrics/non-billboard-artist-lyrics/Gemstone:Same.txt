Same:Gemstone
See, I've walked in silent thought
Past the cinema and bowling halls
Watched the hours, die in the night
No need to talk, as you took flight

And how can you stay friends
When they've seen you naked
Your smile was wide
But your eyes were vacant
No secrets here
We're all the same

Isn't romance so dreadfully old?
That a person could stay for life
But modern ways, cuts like a knife

And how can you stay friends
When they've seen you naked
Your smile was wide
But you eyes were vacant
No secrets here
We're all the same

Now they ask you to stay freinds
You say, 'cause it's hard to forget
You know, folk don't deal with regret
Took a chance then, and lost your bet

And how can you stay friends
When they've seen you naked
Your smile was wide
But your eyes ware vacant
No secrets here
We're all the same
