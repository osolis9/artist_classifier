Diamonds-Exposed:Lil' Keke
(Feat. Chamillionaire & Lil Keke)

[Paul Wall talking]
I'm comin down
I'm bangin screw
Lookin good
Feelin good


[Chorus]
You know i'ma crawl slow/
Popped up sittin on my swangas & 4's/
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on/
I'ma stay playa, you know playas get chose/
So when I come through I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/

[Verse 1.Paul Wall]
Well it's that grain gripper that hold the throne, i'm straight up outta dat third coast/
I split cigars, and pour the bars so pop tha seal let's take a toast/
I stunt the most, i'm still holdin, my paint wet, and the streets soakin/
I'm runnin diamonds like James Loney with the top down & windows open/
Posted up just like Durant on South Lee with big mix/
My partner Black got 2 chicks thats turning tricks & work for tips/
Stayin' licks since I was six with ice grill and diamond lips/
So boy im about to pull out my wrist, now watch your step, my paint drips/
I'm dueced up in Seirra Mist, my bass loud, and i'm crawlin' slow/
I'm draped up, yea that's fasho them karot stones they make me glow/
I'm slamin do's, and i'm sitting low and I been in the game since '94/
I'm gettin dough, my pockets fat, in all black, just like the crow/
Where tha hoe's? where that drank? where tha money? I need that bank/
Come up off a that cash my dogg, i'm bout that bread, you think I ain't?/
I'm a country boy from South Texas better known as the land of the trill/
I'm tippin 4's, and i'm flippin' hoe's and i'm comin down wit woman and grills/

[Chorus]
You know i'ma crawl slow/
Popped up sittin on my swangas & 4's/
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on/
I'ma stay playa, you know playas get chose/
So when I come through I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/

[Verse 2.Chamillionaire]
Chamillitary Mayne!

Takin pics with this model chick and she lookin thick, said she from Atlanta/
Tellin' me that she love my talk, and she live in texas and love the grammer/
Tellin me she bangin' screw and she need a pic of my on the camera/
Whole crew say that broad bad so I looked at them and said "Go on and have her"/
Uh, Playa don't have to talk, look at my chain and ask the cost/
Diamonds on my neck yea that's a house, soon as i'm done might pass her off/
Red over seal; yea that's the south, blue over seal; yea that's the north/
AC blow yea that's my frost, all of that smoke yea that's exhaust/
In my I-M-P-A-L-A Impala, I am a P-L-AY-A and balla/
I drop her off and say call you tomorrow, she callin me back askin me how come I aint call her/
Cuz i'm chasin my paper still and you know how jealous my paper get/
You know i'm attached to my paper, tryin' to hold it down like a paper clip/
Pimp C had told me if you see the chick then go take the chick/
And if you a playa you'll get chose and these other boys can go pay for it/

[Chorus]
You know i'ma crawl slow/
Popped up sittin on my swangas & 4's/
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on/
I'ma stay playa, you know playas get chose/
So when I come through I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/

[Verse 3.Lil Keke]
Dirty south stand up
H-Town's finest
Don Ke

Ey, I ride big and I shine bright, i'm lookin good and my swag right/
My paint wet and my slab tight, my chain gold and my diamonds white/
I'm Don Ke and this H-Town, them playas chose and them haters mad/
I'm screwed up and i'm underground, i'm still trill like, Bun & Chad/
Gucci shades with them new lens, crawlin slow in my blue Benz/
Comin through with this bad broad, me, her, and her two friends/
Haters lookin, I still ball, 26's; they real tall/
My grill did, my rocks big, my screens on, my top fall/
Popped up with them 4's on, 21 but she still grown/
I let her ride and get inside, cuz "I'm A G" was her ringtone/
Hit the stage with my diamonds out, they don't know what my shine bout/
Dirty south my grind spot, boys hatin' but Im still hot/
So clean in this dirty game, still a legend with plenty fame/
My ice nice like Paul and Cham, pay attention it color change/
TF Records & Swisha House, Chamillitary & SUC/
Ask the streets i'm still the best, this whole state it belong to Ke/

[Chorus]
You know i'ma crawl slow/
Popped up sittin on my swangas & vogues/
Jockin all hatas with my gucci shades on/
I'ma stay playa, you know playas get chose/
So when I come through I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
I'm comin down, crawlin slow/
I got my diamonds exposed/
