CONTAINED IN A UNIRESIDING IN MY INNER
MAGNIFICENT VIEW

LIVE WIRE WE RUNNIN IT
SHOCK STUN STUNNING IT
NO PUN IN IT
YOU SEE CRUSTIES DRUM DRUMMING IT
ROOTS OF THE FAITH
TRACE BACK TO YEAR DOT
WE SQUAT UP IN THE RITZ
THEN WE RIP IT DOWN BRICK BY BRICK
COS WE'S A SICK SICK SICK
EXTENSION OF CLIQUE
FRENCH KISSING THE CHAOS
IN A PARALLEL HELL
IMPLODED TERROR

KNOWN TO SPIT ROOTS RAPS
OVER STRIPPED DOWN TRACKS
TRAVEL OVER FORIEGN
GET DRUNK AND ACT SLACK
WILD AS FUCK
WHILE WE'S LIVING IN A PACK
IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS HIP HOP SHIT

CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS
TELL ME HOW BLACK IS BLACK
AIN'T NO LAND IN THE MOTHERLAND
BE TAKIN ME BACK
WITH MY FIVE G.C.S.E'S AND ONE O.N.D
DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT TO UNIVERSITY
SCRATCHED ON FOR HOW LONG
SCUM OF THE SCUM
IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST
WHERE WE FIGHT FOR CRUMB
WE ON THE PSYCHOSPIRITUAL
PSYCHOPHENOMENAL
TRANSIT
SPEAKER OF THE UNSAID SHIT
JUST A SPECK OF DUST
ON THE TIP OF GOD'S DICK
WITH A DICK OF MY OWN
I ZONE ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE
SKANKING ON MY TOE TIP
MAKE MY LIP SHAKE
LEVITATE
AS I EAT CARROT CAKE
EDUCATED IN THE CYCLE OF LIFE
UNICYCLING ON TIGHTROPES
MUCH TOO MUCH FOR SKID VALLEY
LOOK AT ME

DECKED OUT IN ADIDAS
SHE LOVES ME FOR ME
â€˜COS SHE GOT SHE OWN CASH

THAT'S HOW WE GROOVE AN SWAY ETC
