Back-To-Love-Jump-Smokers-Remix-feat-Jay-Sean-:DJ Pauly D
Can you feel it?
All that space in between us
I know you can feel it, I miss you just a little too much

Memories in the breeze, are they gone now?
Thought that I would be right, but Im wrong now
So many feelings,
I miss you just a little too much

We built it up, then let it all crash down
We had it all, but let it burn to the ground
But maybe we can turn around and get back
Cause right now were off track
Im looking for a way back to love
I need you now, Im feenin' for your touch
Come back to love

Can you see it?
Or did everything we were turn into dust?
Do you believe it?
Can we ever get back to us?
To us baby!
