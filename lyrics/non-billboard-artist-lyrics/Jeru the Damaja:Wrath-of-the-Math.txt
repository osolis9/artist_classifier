Wrath-of-the-Math:Jeru the Damaja
Let us now discuss the mental attitude
The mental must always stay clam
You must let nothing move you
Be it good or bad

But when the mental and I be moved
There is no longer good or bad, there just is
When there just is
You have the power to form and shape

So now witness
The wrath of the math
Tell me when you ready
I'm ready
