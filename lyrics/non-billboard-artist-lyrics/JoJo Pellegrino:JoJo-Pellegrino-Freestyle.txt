JoJo-Pellegrino-Freestyle:JoJo Pellegrino
For my man Stretch Arm
The undisputed champ
Uh, Jo be (Jangin'?) like this
Jo-Jo Pellegrino
These cats think they're nice nowdays
These cats think they got (busted?)
Check this
(Starts rapping)
I'm probably the illest MC, believe it or not.
Speak from the heart
Disagree, let's meet at the park.
You better rock some mad shoes
and take a leap from a yacht
Then be that bullseye I penetrate
with the lethalest dart.
Hush puppy, you a tame (doggie?),
(treats for the bark?).
With burning hands out your drawers,
you reachin' for .
I let your (body-dopers) leave from this shop
peeling this top.
My hate kick-back, we battlin'
like heat when it's (swamped?)
Serve beef when it's chopped
Disrespect me, you catch your fresh slice
And I ain't talking 'bout no pizza that's hot
Wrecking sex, tell your rappers
I'm the reason to stop.
And buying guitars,
'cause I'm about to teach them to rock.
Kids (peeping?) them lock
Birds seeing them flock
Speakers just popped,
engineers tweaking (and bob?).
Use the post up
Nowdays I creep on the block
Younger cats who don't know me
Think I'm (bees?) or a cop.
(Heads?) I knew for years
Out and scared the least they (flop?).
What can I say,
you shouldn't put me in that (featuring?) spot.
Eat what I got, now either you peacefully watch
or something 'till your jawbones get weak and they rot
mother.
