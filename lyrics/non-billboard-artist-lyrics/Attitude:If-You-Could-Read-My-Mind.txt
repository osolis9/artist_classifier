If-You-Could-Read-My-Mind:Attitude
If you could read my mind
you know I'd want to stay awhile
I've been searching for a man like you
for all my life
In my heart there's a feeling
that I know just won't subside

If you could read my mind
If you could read my mind

No rain gloves
No more lonely days
no rainbows at the end a pocket full of gold
took away the shadows
may fortune shine my way
and I want to thank you boy for melody
and all my days

And I know sometimes
it's hard to believe
oh that I found you
and you found me

on my face
I know that it shows
ever since I met you boy
I've been walking in this love

If you could read my mind
you know I'd want to stay awhile
I've been searching for a man like you
for all my life
In my heart there's a feeling
that I know just won't subside

If you could read my mind
If you could read my mind

Your love is all I need
No heartache
In the mirror my eyes speak
Took out all the darkness
Sure a love could light the way
And I'm gonna give back
All the feeling that you shined my way

And I know sometimes
It's hard to believe
Oh that I found you
and you found me boy
and on my face
I know that it shows

Ever since I met you boy
I've been walking in this love
If you could read my mind
you know I'd want to stay awhile
I've been searching for a man like you
for all my life
In my heart there's a feeling
that I know just won't subside

If you could read my mind
If you could read my mind

If you could read my mind
you know I'd want to stay awhile
I've been searching for a man like you
for all my life

If you could read my mind
you know I'd want to stay awhile
I've been searching for a man like you
for all my life

If you could read my mind
you know I'd want to stay awhile
I've been searching for a man like you
for all my life
