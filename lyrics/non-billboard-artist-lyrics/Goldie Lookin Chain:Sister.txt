Sister:Goldie Lookin Chain
[Xain]
it's been coming for months I got something to say
we're breaking up and there's no easy way
this siutation i never anticipated
how was i supposed to know you was related?
she's older, she's fitter and her tits are bigger
and she makes me laugh it's not all about the figure
i got this problem like a wart or a blister
truth is
I wanna fuck your sister

[Chorus]
If you leave me now can I fuck your sister?
And your best friend.
If you leave me now can I fuck your sister?
And your best friend.

[Eggs]
We had fun for a while but I shouldda seen it comin
There's no more smiles, no more songs not even humming
Truth is I always knew it was there
The way we kissed and you left me with a blank stare
Don't want the pain, so I think we ought to act
You want to leave and your suitcase is packed
It breaks my heart but the truth has been said
It's the end of the day so let's jus put this to bed
Good luv I hope you find a perfect Mister
But now you're gone can I please fuck your sister?

[Chorus]
If you leave me now can I fuck your sister?
And your best friend.
If you leave me now can I fuck your sister?
And your best friend.

Thing is, you look like her, but like a wonky version or something

[Mysti]
Well yer minds made up and your bags are packed
But I've got something with your sister you and me always lacked.
Like Locomotive's "CHOO CHOO!"
I've run out of track
Yer sisters fit as fuck & your Vadge has gone slack
I still like you
But your sis gets the prize
I was surprised
She opened up all three of my eyes
She's the cherry on my cake
The sausage roll round my meat
When I'm spread eagled on your sister it's a sexual treat.

[Eggs]
Times they are a changing, that's what Bob Dylan said
You put your clothes back on and take your sisters off instead
I'll make it easy we can use a hotel
That way in the morning you won't suffer from the smell
Of our love, united, two as one
Your sister is the reason that I'm writing this song
it's not revenge, anger or frustration
If I'm the reactor then she's the radiation
Like two plus two it's gonna equal four
With you around it's three So please walk out the fucking door

[Chorus]
If you leave me now can I fuck your sister?
And your best friend.
Gonna dump you now cos yer sisters' fitter.
And so's your best friend.

[2hats]
Thing is, you knows I loves you, but your mouth smells funny when I fuck you

[Xain]
So, you think I'm crap in bed?
Well let me have a go with your sister instead
You knows I loves you
You knows it's true
But the thing is, I loves your sister too.
You think me dating your sister is weird
I told 'em all down the pub and they cheered
If I were you I'd be more concerned with my brother
He's having sex with your mother

[Chorus]
If you leave me now can I fuck your sister?
And your best friend.
If you leave me now can I fuck your sister?
And your best friend.
