I-Got-This:Ali
I said bring me along, bring me along
Bring me along, Ali is comin', woah hang
Bring me along, bring me along
bring me along, Ali is comin', woah hang

How many mill must we sell before they respect the L
And realize it ain't for us, it's all for Lavell
Pass that so I can educate the uneducated
And stress the fact it's self braided, we finally made it

Went from buyin' pound from Mr. Down Down Baby
Playin' it cool, fan duckin' click, crack, crazy
Gettin' the crack daily, pay me, my tree in life
Was precise to a swisher in the light

Boy get it right before I go left, baseline pay off the ref
Technical fire, you were fuckin' Chillida to death
It's from the studio then right to the block, I writer's block
'Cuz everything I right for the block is right from the block

Pokemon riffle in glock, bumble be socked
Orange juice in my pocket, in case I swallow my rocks
I did my hustle y'all, we a bad motherfucker y'all
'Tic nigga respect that, where the boys at?

Dirty I got this round and round and round
Dirty drop that beat go around and watch this beat go
Round and round and round, dirty let that beat go

Dirty I got this round and round and round
Dirty let that beat go around and watch this beat go
Round and round and round, dirty let that beat go

Now when it comes to rappin' and going platinum, our have
To get it like Osama Bin Laden walkin' the streets of Manhattan
Give me them sheets to say patented and you bitin' these Tims
And fat laces, it won't happen, I'll let you slide with the jersey backwards

I back words, rap verb and if I had more time
I'd show you how to turn that half to a bird
Lead the new, leave the Hannibal hectic off the meter
And you non believers, you're wrong for that like Cita

The black Einstein ruled the war, never a kind line
Catch up like Heinz 'cuz he owns a rhyme
I'm real listed, on the real list I'm listed
Really listen 'cuz this is for those that really listen

Really listenin' for competition, MC's is mixin' like it's
The Source Awards, should knight go in the door
Big 8 for the track rap, javelin, hurdle hops
I write in hotels before shows, trailers and tow toppers

Dirty I got this round and round and round
Dirty drop that beat go around and watch this beat go
Round and round and round, dirty let that beat go

Dirty I got this round and round and round
Dirty let that beat go around and watch this beat go
Round and round and round, dirty let that beat go

I'm still at it, I'll give it to an addict, had it
Still got it, yours need fluffin' this manic
I rhyme graphic, heavily tattered, shots to ram bank
He'll back small 6-9 erratic

In an automatic pumpin' jigga 22-2
Sittin' on 22's but the spiral 22-2
Shot with the Rubes in the desert and that 22-2
This is 139, almost 22-2

Got home the Rams was up 22-2
Interception about Halloway, he wear 22
Minnie on my phone like, "Hook me up with Nelly
Ali, please dawg, I'm 22-2"

I like them classy, 23's with they back out
Classic ESPN say 23 back out
When over, I guess I bring them 23's back out
And that 22-2 with 3 in it's so pimped out

Dirty I got this round and round and round
Dirty drop that beat go around and watch this beat go
Round and round and round, dirty let that beat go

Dirty I got this round and round and round
Dirty let that beat go around and watch this beat go
Round and round and round, dirty let that beat go

Dirty drop that beat, go round and watch this beat go
Dirty let that beat go, dirty drop the beat
Go round and watch this beat go, dirty let the beat go

I said bring me along, bring me along
Bring me along, Ali is comin', woah hang
Bring me along, bring me along
Bring me along, Ali is comin', woah hang
