Caretaker:Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment
[Verse: DRAM]
I'll take care of you
Even if you got a man now
Cause I been fucking fans now
Still I'll take care of you
Even if you gotta man now
I would have to understand now
Cause I have been bad
Oh but you know I still gotchu baby
I've been bad
I had to do what I had to do
But you know I still love you
Sorry
Still I'll take care of you
(Hey yeah)
Even if you've got a man now
I'd be forced to understand, now
(Ooooh)
