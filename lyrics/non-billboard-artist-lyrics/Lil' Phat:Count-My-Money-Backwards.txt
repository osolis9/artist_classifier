[Chorus:]
ILike to count my money backwards... it's faster

[Webbie:]
I ain't from here atlanta, but I be trappin all the time
I done got to that lil point where money ain een a good thang
So you might jus catch me in the fuckin hottest crippin clubs
Poppin bottles throwin cake at potential models with my thugs
They was thankin I was wrong when I pulled up in my maybach
You'll think I was obama, I run shit like the president
I commit so many sins, I need to go see reverand
I be prayin everyday, don't know what's up in front me
The police up at my door, make me wish I was a ghost
I jus found out on the low, that my lil nigga a hoe
Ian een gon say no names, I'm jus gon go let that shit go
All I smoke is that good doja ion smoke mary no more

[Chorus:]
ILike to count my money backwards... it's faster
I'm not a rapper, I'm a trapper... no actor
We weight her up and then we wrap her... go ask her
And watch me move her like casper... (inaudible)
Count my fuckin money backwards... it's faster
I'm not a rapper, I'm a trapper... no actor
We weight her up and then we wrap her... go ask her
And watch me move her like casper... like casper
I like to count my money backwards

[Verse 3: ~Phat~]
I count it backwards it's faster, like a money machine
I'm a countin money bastard, I'm countin in my sleep
You can catxh me at tha studio, no shows for bouht a week
Yes I'm out for bouht a week so I'm a need about a tree
For them niggas who be rappin, but still be trappin
I am not a rapper, I'm a trapper, I be magic
I'm from Baton Rouge buht I'm in ATL stackin
I'm Murcielago stuntin, that's 100 bricks of traffic
Mi niggas right behind me and they hollin we tha baddest
We give her dope dick, then wrap her in plastic
And watch me move em like I'm casper
You want a brick from me you gotta count yo money backwards

[Chorus:]
ILike to count my money backwards... it's faster
I'm not a rapper, I'm a trapper... no actor
We weight her up and then we wrap her... go ask her
And watch me move her like casper... (inaudible)
Count my fuckin money backwards... it's faster
I'm not a rapper, I'm a trapper... no actor
We weight her up and then we wrap her... go ask her
And watch me move her like casper... like casper
I like to count my money backwards
