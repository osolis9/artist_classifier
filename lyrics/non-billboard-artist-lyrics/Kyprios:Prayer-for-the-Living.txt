Prayer-for-the-Living:Kyprios
kyprios 12 verse 7 through 10
may the bullet of the war be exchanged for a pen
see life is an empty page
and our story's told in days
see words form a sentence in third world dimentions
what are you gonna say?
when I write let me write what the truth is
for righteous is the plight of the ruthless
give me wisdom in spite of my ignorance
it's just another beckoning for lost innocence
in a sense, let me make the cents not the money make me
may I give more than I take may nothing take me
and my family, give me all the best qualities
I wouldn't qualify for life without them loving me
above in the east, let it set in the west
and when it's all said and done may i settle and rest
in the sun
learn to love and be concious
friends tell the truth and keep me honest

Chorus:
it ain't about religion, it's more about the rhythem
it's kind of like a vision it's a prayer for the living
(repeat)
it's a prayer for the living
just a prayer for the living

give me strength for all my weakest moods
give me persistance so i can improve
and when i lose let me learn of my abilities
bring me victories accompanied with humility
and it'll be humanities anatomy that damage me
so i'm a keep a revoloutionaries sense of anarchy
and a please for a mind made for leadership
and when i die may my blood bring love for bleeding it
give me soul - give me rhythm
give the power to the streets and the people who are in them
may my fifteen minutes of fame be extended
to do something good so my name will be remembered
remember my memories may the bottle not get the best of me
eventually have a girl that understands me
may i keep mistakes to a minimum
may i learn forgiveness for my enimies and be forgiven

Chorus
