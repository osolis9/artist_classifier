Green-Bay:Gemstone
Looking in the mirror
Buttons in a line
Did you notice my smile?
Did you notice my smile today?

Red light, Green Bay
Watching you all day
The work hours - wasted now
Won't you look my way (won't you look my way) Please show me how.

Saving a chair for you
Coffee black, plates two
Noticed you were late today
Hope you made it to break ok

Red light, Green Bay
Watching you all day
The work hours - wasted now
Won't you look my way (won't you look my way) Please show me how.

Took a message for you
A girl called Marie
Said you left your phone at hers
A perfect built Venus in Furs

Red light, Green Bay
Watching you all day
The work hours - wasted now
Won't you look my way (won't you look my way) Please show me how.

No need for a ride now
Need the walk today
Took the train across the Bay
Didn't think it would end this way
Red light, Green Bay
Watching you all day
The work hours - wasted now
Won't you look my way (won't you look my way) Please show me how.(please show me how).
