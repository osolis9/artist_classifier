Crazy-Girl:Young Rome
It's only right that I'm killin' it
Homey, put yo hands up if you feelin' it
(Hip, hip, hooray)
Ladies, freeze when I say so
Stick yo booty out just a lickle bit [unverified]

Man, I'm up in the club crunkin' the usual
Some of dese fat chicks is bootyful, oops, I mean beautiful
Ass so cutical, make yo booty clap girl, you so musical
(Let the music work yo booty now)

And a back braids out grippin' a big glass of yack
You didn't chip in on dis pass it back
Yous a super hero, girl, bag it back
Man, I keep the clug action packed

Ballas flossin' throw up ya stacks

It's sick when they see the way I hop out the range
And I let my chain swang like an arangatang
Shawty wanna [unverified] for a little change
Holla for a dolla, now bounce like an Impala

Homey, if you got a drink put yo glass up
Now take a little swolla, the san hacineo
But I make the whole show bark like a rot wilda
(Roo, roo, roo, roo)
Man, I'm a young pimp

I don't want yo wife in addition to yo daughter, holla
Sip on dat fine wata, I'm am party till tomara

Sweeter den java, hatas [unverified] 'cuz dey mad I got her

Now you know you got too much booty
For that little mini skirt, take it off
And I can taste yo lip gloss, baby
Yo body is so damn soft

You know you got too much money
Sittin' on dem 22 inch spinnin'
It's getting hot in here tonight
Can I come home witchu?

Niggas in the hood don't wanna see me last
I'm tryna get my life together, please don't laugh
Chicks chase the humma when dey see me pass
Crack the concrete when the CD blast

Tracks to E Class anytime I [unverified]
Wood grain dash magnate to cash
Young pimp, I'm a magnet to ass
Push it 'pon me, girl damn, you so fast
