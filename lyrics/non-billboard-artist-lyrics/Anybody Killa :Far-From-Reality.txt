Far-From-Reality:Anybody Killa 
[Verse 1:] 
This is how it´s bout to go down 
belive it or not I´m still here 
all u haters time ta shed anotha tear 
cuz I´m back in dis bitch like ur moms ex-boy friend 
all up in ur face with sum brand new nonsence 
dis if u want to go ahead an take a shot 
sooner or later dat shit gne be sqwat 
I´m a killa wit a attitude road raggin like a foo 
rollin wid a family tha size of a typhone 

[Chorus:] 
we ain´t goin away 
hu 
we ain´t goin away

(Far from reality) 

[Verse 2:] 
Who u think u fuckin with 
dis shit getting serious 
ain´t no time for busted lips 
dis shit I bust will turn u bitch 
turn ur back an walk away 
keep on thinkin dat u safe 
it´s a small world after all 
so ill juz wait until dat day to pull ma heat 
an lay u out or grab ma blade an start to scalp 
either way I do not doubt this sweet revenge keeps me aroun 
silently right on ur trail 
if u live only time will tell 
ill be there tho if u wake 
so u can see we here to stay! 

[Chorus:] 
we ain´t goin away

[Chorus:]
