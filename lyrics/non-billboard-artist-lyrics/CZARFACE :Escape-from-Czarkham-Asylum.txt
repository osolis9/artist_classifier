Escape-from-Czarkham-Asylum:CZARFACE 
[Verse 1 - Inspectah Deck]
The only time they go hard is when they having sex
Six-shotter Smith, hotter then the dragon's breath
Original Dark Knight I’m Adam West
My chick notice the burn she like Sharon Gless
Deck's official, got a whistle and pin stripes
Be Smooth B, everything Greg Nice and heads like
Son, take performance enhancers
Barry Bond flow, so they talking outlandish

[Verse 2 - Esoteric]
The Glock that I brandish put my thugs on the canvas
7L made the beat, CZARFACE doing damage
The god of chaos [?] his way off
Rap life, sweatsuit, not a day off
Stay off the dilly, the bars is silly, guard your grilly
I'm barking rappers like Sir Charles in Philly
I'm wild down the back like a rotary phone
The wolf pack's back tell them coyotes we home
[Verse 3 - Esoteric]
I’m that cannon I’m that great you that bottom shelf
I’m not God fearing I’m God himself
You travelling light I’ll be waiting with your vocals on
You paint a picture man that’s a photobomb
I clock you out I mass murder everything
You a natural I can’t grip these swings
Then you out of the park yea it’s a powerful thought
You dog sound like bloodhound when they bark
I got snipers that will mount you in the dark

[Verse 4 - Inspectah Deck]
No sound of the spark goldfish fuck around with the sharks
No bitch no cowards at heart no matter how big a part
No second thoughts i was down from the start
Go shuffle like a victory elves or you scary fools
Body froze up the rows I could barely move
Rarely loose seen me sitting in the daily news
Verbal intercourse curl your toes like fairy shoes

[Interlude]
Don't worry about him that guy is dumber than
The barrel with hammers at the bottom of the frozen lake
I know your kind I read the details
And see you on tv in a couple more games
You can explain no I do no explaining around here
I would foot my lace so far up your behind
You going to wonder why your mouth taste like boots
Seriously though

[Verse 5 - Esoteric]
Told it to the guards shit is overcharged
Throw the bars this way you know we large
That’s taking to a new plateau, you rap slow
You know the fucking military actors scooping it
Dance with them pen Daien and activate the
Mother fucking shit again don’t pretend
If you don’t know the man then you don’t know
You look dumb like Red Fox when he overslept
Slow your step flow, its pimped out like just a custom model
Fram the fight like Cus D'Amato
I get so much fan that they do the deep verses
I got a block it’s like I can’t right curse her

[Interlude]
Wow what is it ya’ll
Is it really what they asked for
It’s really what they jam for
Wow what is it ya’ll
Is it really what they asked for
It’s really what they jam for
Wow what is it ya’ll
7L legendary revving next to your highness
Apocalypse wild right now

[Verse 6 - Inspectah Deck]
When I’m on the scene drama is routine
I mean it’s going to take the Army Navy and Air Force Marines
I’m a monster fuck shit up my middle name
I my mosh out your possy like dacning to the fame
No block in my lane getting conch style playing
Hand ball with the choppers and planes
The beast is released I’m coming through the streets
As a million dollars rise high under my feet
While walking through explosion blowing up tanks
To reciprocate the notion showing no emotions
And left behind just a path of destruction
Aftermath I’m the rath I conduct it
Hustling the city beating on my chest like
You want me come and get me you frontin' me is risky
I’m godzilla with bars the godzilla with
Bars it ain’t real until you feeling the scars
I’m godzilla I’m godzilla with bars the godzilla with
Godzilla godzilla godzilla
Godzilla godzilla
I’m godzilla with bars the godzilla with
Godzilla godzilla godzilla

[Verse 7 - Esoteric]
Eh yow club 1 2 3I’m telling you we don’t quit
My name ain’t necessary ya’ll on the altar ya’ll eh yo yo
Check one two and you don’t quit
I’m on the real possession I’m the ultimate
Ey yo thought you were switching places
Though you were triple sixes two’s are too malicious
My dimensions are too delicious
I got my head up in the cloud and
And my feet up in Brooklyn keep pushing tank like
I keep cushions of wow I’m dying on key side
I’m 90 I’m mint tall you got yours wide
Yea the 93 versions these personal don’t need no searching
Keep searching for the bodies deep beneath the earth and
My footprint is bigger than Fenway Park
When they start shooting hours in the day
My pen stay smart your pen dumb and dull
To your number you a numb nuts skull
You spitting lyrical and leave the mic on critical
And make the crowd get physical
We a bishop too we don’t want you with that bull shit
We ain’t want shit we just stick to the principles
Gripping through with the clipp full
We far from the typical we a bishop too
We don’t hit you with that bull shit
We just stick to the principles

[Interlude]
You goin to the authorities describing a guy in prehistoric
One that spits fire and they just put you away for a long time
But we saw them captain you saw them those monsters
They are real I know just when to keep my mouth shut
Have another drink mr bishop I don’t want anymore
We got to report what we see captain don’t you understand
They are two of the most monstrous
Creatures any man has ever seen

[Verse 8 - Inspectah Deck]
And you and black boys poll they don’t get it
2015 rappers bang on Reddit
Sit your ass down like marble and credit
The bowl is sitting check before your team get wrecked
You need to spark up a spliff to get your bars up
While I’m lifting cars up wrong tree to bark up
I carve up a hollywood actor and back a starbuck
Them hopped out the dumpster
While bloody you feeling star struck
Because the star struck his body is like storm shadow
Pulling off in an escalator and I follow the star truck
Then another zar cut every day I’m hustling
Its Rick Ross and his bizzare cut
Yes Mars what Here’s the bulk of the puke I barfed up
And it's still more appealing than your shit
Because yours is horse shit
You got your wheel spinning but you leave no trail
A broken Morphine and it all falls to cokehead
With no head you get brave then you catch heat
Like coffee pads I be murcher I’m spazzing like my arm
Supposed to ghost you're so hood but no good
You are so hood like dog camping
We going right in my execution my execution is sharper than
Tools in brutus no barber goosing loose in the barber and
I’m proving I’m smarter than I gas them off and Gary Casero
And them like David Husalah Ha ha I can’t even finish that
They think that I’m pinning that now where the fuck my civics at
Trying to turn off my cell phone and enslave us
I got bars I should write for cats like Jim Davis

[Outro]
Write for cats for cats yea I know
For your case It’s fast like a car chase
I want to join your group
Kids out there running that shit
If they just let me see her you seem like a blunt
And the thing is you know a lot of people
Were so stupid how to meet them up with some medly
It can be handicapped but you did
And just imagine if my man Beethoven
Had a fucking sampler
Exactly if he had DJ’s
