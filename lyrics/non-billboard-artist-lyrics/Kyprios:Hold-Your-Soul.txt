Hold-Your-Soul:Kyprios
I look 'em in the eye but they cannot see
I tell it from my heart but they don't believe
I hit you in the place where you keep your dreams
I fertilize your mind when I plant these seeds
My heart drums the beat
I circulate the globe with the air I breathe
I need to reach the world with the words I speak
Kyprios, I got my ink in my soul that bleeds

I am just a messenger giving you the messages
I ain't got the answer, I'll show you what the question is
I am just a messenger giving you the messages
I ain't got the answer but I'll show you what the question is

Diamonds ain't forever even gold will go
All you got is you ya'd better hold your soul
Fight back, get back, live that and take control
All you got is you so baby hold your soul

One thing affects the other
So in some way we're all connected to each other
Fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
And other mother fuckers under it all who wanna make you suffer
But it's straight through carry your weight load
Try to make a difference when you're making the pesos
It ain't so bad little man, it could always be worse
I tell the truth and it hurts

The world is my perch and I'll leave in a hearse
But I will leave better than when I was seeing it first
The world is my perch and I'll leave in a hearse
But I will leave better than when I was seeing it first

Diamonds ain't forever even gold will go
All you got is you ya'd better hold your soul
Fight back, get back, live that and take control
All you got is you so baby hold your soul

I look 'em in the eye but they cannot see
I tell it from my heart but they don't believe
I hit you in the place where you keep your dreams
I fertilize your mind when I plant these seeds
Valley of death when I'm feelin' deep
I spit hell fire when need soem heat
Name Kyp Cocaine I wont let you sleep
Venom in my tongue cause I'm dyin' to speak
Jump back, jump back, front back
Do this, say that, fuck that
Too late, too deep to turn back
Call me loose lip Lucifer I burn the track

I am just a messenger giving you the messages
I ain't got the answer, I'll show you what the question is
I am just a messenger giving you the messages
I ain't got the answer but I'll show you what the question is

Diamonds ain't forever even gold will go
All you got is you ya'd better hold your soul
Fight back, get back, live that and take control
All you got is you so baby hold your soul
