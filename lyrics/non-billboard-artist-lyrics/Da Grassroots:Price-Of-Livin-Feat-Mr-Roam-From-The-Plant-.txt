see that girl right there
they say she's sexy as hell
'cause when she glides into the room
oh her presence is felt
it's like, she's insatiable, irresistable
i know that i can get her and i won't even try
'cause she gave me that look
like i'm the type of guy that knows
how to please her
knows just what she needs
i know i'm dreaming she's in love with me
but in reality, she's a one night machine
i know she doesn't fall in love at all
love is all i need
and i don't care about
nothing in life is free
love is all i need
and i don't care about
it's the price of company
it's intentional
she can be so persuadable
but please believe me
she tells her time with dollar and cents
i am the clock that pays the rent
dressed to kill and she's taking all my will
and i can't stop want it all
i'm sure to pay for this
love is all i need
and i don't care about
nothing in life is free
love is all i need
and i don't care about
it's the price of company[x2]
there's a devil to my left
an angel to my right
she's been running circles all around my mind
with a body like that
who could say no
she'll leave with my moneyand my self control[x2]
see that girl right there
she's sexy as hell[x2]
love is all i need
and i don't care about
nothing in life is free
love is all i need
and i don't care about
it's the price of company[x2]
