I-Don-t-Wanna-Talk-About-It:411
SPOKEN
I know about your girlfriend
I found out from her friend
There's no point denying
'Cos I don't wanna talk about it
VERSE 1
Should have known you were too good to be true
Should have known there's no way I could trust you
The times when we were apart
You were lying and cheating and breaking my heart
Looking back now I feel so damn naive
Spinning lines that you knew I would believe
Like times when you used to say
That you couldn't come home because you're working late
When you're with me, I don't know what you tell your girlfriend
Boy, she must be so stupid to believe that she's the only one
But all I know, is that your little game is over
I'm regretting the day that you first walked away
I can't even say that it's been nice to know ya
CHORUS
I know about your girlfriend
I found out from her friend
Don't try to pretend
'Cos I don't wanna talk about it
I know you've been lying
No-one can deny it
But boy I'm done crying
And I don't wanna talk about it
VERSE 2
Remember boy when you used to say
That you'd never take your love away
I just can't believe that you had the audacity
To be creeping on me
Sleepin' around while you leave me here alone
When I call I just get your answerphone
Something is going on
'Cos it's six in the morning and you still ain't home
When you're with me, I don't know what you tell your girlfriend
Boy, she must be so stupid to believe that she's the only one
But all I know, is that your little game is over
I'm regretting the day that you first walked away
I can't even say that it's been nice to know ya
CHORUS - REPEAT TO FADE...
I know about your girlfriend
I found out from her friend
Don't try to pretend
'Cos I don't wanna talk about it
I know you've been lying
No-one can deny it
But boy I'm done crying
And I don't wanna talk about it
