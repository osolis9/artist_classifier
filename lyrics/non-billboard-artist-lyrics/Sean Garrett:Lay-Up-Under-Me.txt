Lay-Up-Under-Me:Sean Garrett
I was just thinking
Maybe I could just come over tonight
And spend a little time with you

Eh, I was out shopping, thinking of something I should get you
'Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more but just to stare in your face
Let you know I'm so happy, you're my best friend

Part of this fortune, girl, I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Take time out, starting with today, for my babe

We're gonna hit the floor at home
(Slow dance naked, babe)
Gonna let those candles be your light tonight
(Kiss your favorite place)

Girl, I'ma DJ all your songs
(Rock your party for you)
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club
Just come on, lay up under me tonight

Eh, girl, you know just how I do it, I'm on the way
And you know when it comes to my lady, I bring my best
I'm gonna be so on it tonight
Don't worry about a club, just come on, lay up under me tonight

You've been having car trouble, here's your new keys I got you
Remember that's your dream car, girl, now your dream is true
Two years together, nothing you've asked me for
That says a lot about you, no doubt about it, for you anything I'd do

We're gonna hit the floor at home
(Slow dance naked, babe)
Gonna let those candles be your light tonight
(Kiss your favorite place)

Girl, I'ma DJ all your songs
(Rock your party for you)
You ain't gotta worry bout a club
Just come on, lay up under me tonight

We're gonna hit the floor at home
(Slow dance naked, babe)
Gonna let those candles be your light tonight
(Kiss your favorite place)

Girl, I'ma DJ all your songs
(Rock your party for you)
You ain't gotta worry bout a club
Just come on, lay up under me tonight

Eh, girl, you know just how I do it, I'm on the way
And you know when it comes to my lady, I bring my best
I'm gonna be so on it tonight
And it's gonna be obvious to see, is this where I wanna be

Just let me look at you, oh, you wearing my favorite thing
Just let me taste, girl, you already know in what way
And if they don't know how much you're meaning to me
Then you might just wanna flash them the ring

Come here
I just wanna take time to stare into your eyes
And let you know how much I adore you and miss you
And want you to see that tonight you're

We're gonna hit the floor at home
(Slow dance naked, babe)
Gonna let those candles be your light tonight
(Kiss your favorite place)

Girl, I'ma DJ all your songs
(Rock your party for you)
You ain't gotta worry bout a club
Just come on, lay up under me tonight

We're gonna hit the floor at home
(Slow dance naked, babe)
Gonna let those candles be your light tonight

You ain't gotta worry bout a club
Just come on, lay up under me tonight
