Phantom-of-the-Galaxy:Saint
What is your reason to destroy,
It comes with treason your decoy,
You pose as friend to all our race,
But hell has sent you your home base.

“Death is the name that you claim
Phantom of the galaxy
Death is the name that you claim Phantom”
(Of the galaxy)

What is the fate of those that you hate,
Binding your victims they’re tortured and chained,
In your clammy grip a monster insane,
Poison and perfume come in small flasks
Pours out like water to those that dare ask.

You hunt your prey, hit in the night,
You always slay us when we fight,
You caused our trouble from within,
Reduced to rubble, still will win
