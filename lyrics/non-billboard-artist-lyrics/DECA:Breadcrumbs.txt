Breadcrumbs:DECA
Things are far more serious then I suspect you've been
told
People are dying up here
And that isn't the end
Well how did all this happen?
We have been completely cut off from Earth
Any chance of restoring contact?
Very little sir, We've lost all direct communication

I gave em two 16's in a lucid dream
With the muses playing theme music on a super string
Watch me do my thing when the hypodermic stings
I could intervene by turning Mr. Hyde to Mr. Clean
From lean mean dope sick fiend to pristine
Stick to piff and nicotine, quit menacing the scene get medicine from clinics
Say your penance when its finished then its Venice in a vintage rented tinted limousine
Big things, big screens with big brother's ugly mug
Selling us a pyramid scheme like a fucking drug
And love died with the troubadours, now its all ego driven
We're fetal position with the needle dripping
A foul ecosystem, keep on living, be persistent
In a prison where heaven and hell are equidistant
Give em 2 sets Marie Antoinette necks
Stakes is High's in the cassette deck take it back

Everything's sunny, everything's lovely, put me on a pedestal, hold no one above me
Everything's pleasant and good, eating breadcrumbs like the little peasant that could
Fuel for the furnace combust, learn to adjust, you view the world on the surface with a certain disgust
But everything's sunny everything's lovely, put me on a pedestal, hold no one above me

Catch a stone cast at your dome by a
Self righteous sinner that would send Gestapo to tap your phone
I got the blues, got a lot to lose, got the news so-and-so past
Check the database for slideshows and photographs
You grow detached from your chosen path lose control and crash on a overpass
Motionless focused inward, with loved ones
Howling like a thousand Ginsberg's with pinched nerves
Robert Johnson gave me his guitar pick
I can play super strings and rap about my hardships
You could lie through your teeth and spoon feed em arsenic
Who could stoop the lowest who could fall the farthest
It began when we took an apple off a tree limb, sweet sin
Sustenance to sink teeth in
Took a risk and got 86'd for high treason
The pivotal moment simple components defy reason

Everything's sunny, everything's lovely, put me on a pedestal, hold no one above me
Everything's pleasant and good, eating breadcrumbs like the little peasant that could
Fuel for the furnace combust, learn to adjust, you view the world on the surface with a certain disgust
But everything's sunny everything's lovely, put me on a pedestal, hold no one above me

Starvation, humiliation, despair, frustration
Every god damn thing
For all your ills I give
You laughter
