Before-It-s-over-Pt-:Phora
Visions of me and my peeps at the top
Nothing came easy we needed a plot
And they said they'de doubt we'd ever make it
But that's the very same reason we fought
So close to giving up on life I wanted to quite
Like why keep going if they don't know you exist
But the fans helped me down like no other
So I hope that you get
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Cause I know it's a bitch
Ya this thing we call life
But yall helping me make it through
All I dream of is my music doing the same for you
But tell me where's god when you need him
And why does it only feel like the devil is present
When my mind is tempeted by my demons
Shit I guess it's all a part of his plan
But it's hard to keep my faith
When everyone's saying that you're hardly a man
Even though you're taking care of your fam
Even though you put all your dreams on the line and gave them all that you can
I'de give my life for them
But would they do the same for me
It got me thinking if the shit they said was make believe
Cause it just seems like all they do is take and leave
And leave me in the dust without a place to be
People looking in from the outside
They don't know what you feeling
My worlds caving in
Im suffocating
Dressed by the sealing
The walls are closing in
And 4 years back if you ask anyone bout Marco they'd just say I lost hope in him
Well I ain't even have hope in myself
And they keep saying they feel me but they don't know how it felt
When I was on the wround dieing, screaming just for someone to help
But no one came I had to comfort myself
Going through a pai, n I just couldn't take I much rather die
Gets to me everytime, I ain't even tell my mother goodbye
These niggas tried to kill me, like realy these niggas tried
So it must mean that there's a reason I'm breathing and still alive
And I don't want revenge
I want these niggas to see me drive
And live my dreams and watch me change the world and one day realize
That they can do it to they just need someone to open their eyes
Cause I ain't got no hate in my heart
For not one of these guys
Cause all these cats wanna be gangsters, I just want to be me
Just want to be free from the world and shit that's all on tv
Seems like im dodging all my incoming calls
Ain't replying to texts
Man i just want to get away from it all
And mom deserves a new house, but I just can't afford it
Seems like I got the perfect song, but I just can't record it
If this was my last song how long would it last
See I know I fucked up see that's all in the past
Cause everything can be gone in a flash
And watch me pave my way and watch the leaders follow my ass
And I bet my teachers couldn't name a day they saw me in class
Fuck around have me speak to your students, watch all of them pass
You ain't succeed until you follow your ass
Cause shit we feel way to many times to count now all of us laugh
But they say man cry to as a tear drops from my eye
Asks myself what have you done good phora besides you
I'm still a kid so
I still make mistakes I
I just wanna live before the good times fades away now
Before the good times fade away now
Now where's everyone I used to call my friend
I've been so lost inside myself I guess I lost my touch within I mean
I don't blame them I got to much on my mind
Trust issues from the past but I wish I can press rewind and take it all back
Fuck rap, fuck the media, fuck the news the internet and all these fucking lies they
feeding you
Fuck apologise cause everything I did it happened for a purpose
And fuck them if they ever said you're worthless so
Fuck my anxiety, fuck my depression I just can't figure out the reason why the fuck I've been stressing
And fuck lovingsomeone who just don't seem to love you back
Cuase we all need someone to be there when we feel trapped or confused we all got
something to prove
But i just can't stand the thought of losing someone like you
Fuck stressing on the people who put you down for no reason
Fuck the ones who said they didnt believe in everything that you said you would do
and now that it's done they start to come running
Fuck drinking to the point when you feel nothing
Fuck the rumors, fuck the gossip dogs, fuck their assumptions
Fuck the ones who said they had your back when they knew they was frunting
And fuck every doubt they had against you
They was clowing on you, yiu though they was clowing with you
But it's all good shit I guess it's all a part of his plan cause all they said I'll
never be is all that i am
