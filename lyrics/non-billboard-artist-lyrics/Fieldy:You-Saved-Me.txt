You-Saved-Me:Fieldy
(Cheech: Hello)
Hey Cheech
(Cheech: Hey Fieldy, what's up dude?)
Ah, I've been like down on myself yesterday
(Cheech: aww man no, hey don't do that, take a chill pill, ok just take half)
Haha (Cheech: I don't want you to get too chilled) cool
(Cheech: alright due, any time) alight man (Cheech: bye dude) Peace

You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
You never let me down, you're amazing, I get from others don't plaze me

I see you over there, looking nice and sweet
Don't mean to stare pretty green leaf,
Smoking on you is what I like to do,
I like to be alone when I get stoned,

So I don't have to think about the future or the past,
Now I can lay back and relax, pass me the bong,
I'm as high as Cheech and Chong (cough)
Marinating my brain, you keep me from going insane,

Numbs all my pain, I can't complain,
No reason for no stress, marijuana you're the best,
Knotted up stomach, just get high, believe me you'll love it
Watching time fly by, puff puff puff it,

Everything is good, everything is gray,
This is good wood, I love that after-taste

You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
You never let me down, you're amazing, I get from others don't plaze me
You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
Now it's time to love to be lazy, crazy as I sound you're amazing

Puff Puff Puff, give that shit to me,
So I can live, stress free like H.R. puffinstuff,
I love to puff and puff and puff, til I can see or breathe,
Sticky icky trees, you got my back, weed, mary jane,

Mouth watering trees, it sucks to choke, but when you done it's fun,
So I take another toke, slanted eyed as chang chong,
Four twenty, four twenty one, anytime it's fun,
But nothing gets done, weed makes me happy when I'm feeling crappy,

What's wrong with that? I ain't trying to feel like crap,
I ain't saying it's for everyone, unless you like fun,
Don't be afraid, to act dumb, don't even trip, but if you do it's fun

You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
You never let me down, you're amazing, I get from others don't plaze me
You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
Now it's time to love to be lazy, crazy as I sound you're amazing

You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
You never let me down, you're amazing, I get from others don't plaze me
You saved me, sticky icky icky, from being crazy (I ain't one to be picky)
Now it's time to love to be lazy, crazy as I sound you're amazing
You Saved Me
