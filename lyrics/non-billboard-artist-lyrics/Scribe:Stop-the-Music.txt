Stop the Music
scribe) And I hope you feel my pain Hope you don’t forget my name For the cause I claim Reason I came, tell me, was in all in vain I walk all in chain For the midnight rain I sing And the man would say (Stop the music playing loud and clear) But they don't wanna hear oh Lord they don't wanna hear Buts its loud and clear And its deep inside my soul (For dam nations near) 

(pnc) yeah raise some hands say my name and let it rain X4 

(scribe) And I refuse to lose No I never been a type to quit Ill properly give it now And just turn back around And that’s one of many differences because I don’t care what the distance is I told you ill take it all the way I couldn’t just walk away And just pretend like I don’t have more to say (Stop the music playing low and clear ) But they don't wanna hear oh Lord they don't wanna hear Buts it’s loud and clear And its deep inside my soul They can’t hold me down no more they got to let me go . 

(pnc) raise some hands say my name and let it rain X4 

(scribe) Cause I know what I got to do I couldn’t stop now even if I wanted to They told me give it up its impossible And if I bury my head in the sand like the ostriches do And I’m young and I still got a lot to prove Cant stop won’t stop unstoppable Elevated broken down all obstacles Until I head a voice from other side of the room Telling me to (Stop the music playing low and clear) But they don't wanna hear oh Lord they don't wanna hear Buts it’s loud and clear And its deep inside my soul They can’t hold me down no more They got to let me go (For dam nations near) 

(pnc) yeah raise some hands say my name and let it rain X8
