Hey diddle diddle with the cat in the middle
Check out the Juvenile while I bust this riddle
Last night I met a freak, that I knew in the club,
Felt the friction from her body when I gave her a hug
I let her know up front, I ain't got no ride,
But won't you holla at the Juvey when we get outside?
She asked me fast, what we gonna do?
We gonna talk a little walk to the Rochambeaux
Now I must admit, this was a shive dressed chick
But she wasn't that shive, I couldn't give her the stick
I went to G-ing this freak she couldn't take this stick
She went to moanin' and groanin' Juvenile please quit
I said "TRIIIIIIIICK, stop talkin' that it,
And buy Juvenile his outfit
I want a shive Girbaud shirt, polo socks
Girbaud shorts and a pair of Reeboks"
All the fellas say "TRIIIIIIIIIIIICK, stop talkin' that it,
And buy Juvenile his outfit
I want a shive Girbaud shirt, polo socks
Girbaud shorts and a pair of Reeboks"

Some red beans, a cuit and small fries.

Yes I smoke weed, and that's it black
So don't give no one, don't give no one no crack
One cigarette and a 40 and snake
And I fire weed spliff would just make my day
When I get high, I be spooked out
Bootin' up like I got a bunch of golds in my mouth
If you got it on your mind fella, we can go
I'm from the 3, Mac, Melph, and the Calio.
