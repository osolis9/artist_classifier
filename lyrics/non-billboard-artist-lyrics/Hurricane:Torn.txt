Torn:Hurricane
Gave it more than you will ever know
Diggin' almost half way to my core
You and I we burn from different fires but
There was somethin' in the flame that kept it warm
You can't sleep with your denial
Teach a lie to speak but it won't make it true
Give it up now and embrace what's meant to be
Beliefs that we must pursue
And I know now if something's more
Than nothin' better we must try
Torn from our destiny lives scattered 'cross the sea
Torn always away from me livin' lies makes us poor
Over water and across the land
Separate but together never is
Time and space is all that can divide us but
There's somethin' killin' off what could be born
Givin' in is never easy
If it's worth the words it must be worth the war
Fear's not emptiness and pain is only part
The past cannot come before
And I know now if something's more
Than nothin' better we must try
Torn from our destiny lives scattered 'cross the sea
Torn always away from me livin' lies makes us poor
And I know now if something's more
Than nothin' better we must try
Torn from our destiny lives scattered 'cross the sea
Torn always away from me livin' lies makes us poor
Can only be torn from our destiny lives scattered 'cross the sea
Torn always away from me livin' lies makes us poor
