Lil-Poppa-Got-A-Brand-New-Bag:Young Bleed
Go get that paper Lil Pop, fuck all that drama and drag
Don't stop for nuttin' my noggin' just put it down with a sag
I never knew nothin' better than choppin' cheddar for cheese
Passin' my enemies, blowin' in the breeze

Don't make it no murder my nigga, niggaz die young where I'm from
Sippin' on red rum, poppin' till the dead drunk
Make money my nigga but keep it real doe cause Soldier boyz
Be stompin' in steel toes, with nuttin' to live foe, ya heard me fool?
That's how I come up, that's how it go down

Niggaz and bitches make the world go 'round, without a sound
We clown low down and dirty with the Dirty, Dirty flippin'
From a nickel bag of weed, to a thirty thirty
Holla at ya boy, unemployed, in the welfare line gettin' mine
Smellin' like a pound of paiyan, however we shine
In blind fury dodgin' the judge and the jury

They wanna beat me but can't see me 'cause they vision too blurry
I ride from state to state, seein' them checkin' my plate
It's like, everywhere you go they gotta playa hate a nigga main
I do my thang from here to Maine, like it ain't no thang
(What? Uh)
'Cause see you gotta let em hang main, fuck that shit

Nigga, get your mind right 'cause when the time's right
Niggaz will put yo' ass to sleep, I thinks deep
(Huh bro?)
Fuck what you heard, you gots to see to believe
And if you blind to visualize a nigga chasin' this cheese
Down on my knees at my bedside, sayin' my grace

'Cause in the mornin' I'll be gone a nigga makin' my way, okay
I keep em jumpin' like the jacks to little macks, my netti
Ready for confedi and fuck what they tryin' to tell me
I'm bout to get it and the only way I know
Is rappin' if it don't happen I'm makin' bitches hit the flo', you know

Fuck block to block hoe, it's coast to coast, and it's easy
We G and do it legit those raps with locs
On the fork but game sharper than a surgeon for scalpel
You wanna battle no hassle come let me kick it what cha asked foe
And razzle yo' ass, nut up like heaven and hash

As my little brain's tearin' the tenement blast, they pity ass
But I'm flickin' my ashes stickin' asses of bastards
Fieldin' shit like flea flickers and kickin' it with G niggaz
See what you makin' with the raise at your job
Is what a nigga like this here can shake two days in the mob

And I could be my own boss employed by the streets
(Do what main?)
I'm chasin' Jakes and player Haitian on Friday the 15th
With my Air Mack splendid Nike's on my feet
With weed in the air, soul secluded from the police

'Cause I'm a little on the wild side, thuggin' and pluggin'
That make a nigga wanna jack for the fuck of it
But see I makes peace to get the shit a nigga wish he could have
Long as you stay the fuck out they pop a brand new bag
Nigga what
