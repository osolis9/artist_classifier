Desecrated-Flesh:Sinister
Sinister
Siabolic Summoning
Desecrated Flesh
Stir in darkness through the chamber of disgrace
Malicious cellar, abhorrence place
Evaporating stench of rotting body parts
Nailed to the wall, mutilated and deformed
Fridge with chopped heads, vermin flies and crawls all over
Carnage temple, necropolis
Bodies fused as heaps of putrid waste
Tubful with innards
Skull stacked as an altar, candles burning
Carnage temple, necropolis

Resurrection of the savage within
Eruption from the beast of sin
Dead fills a monstrous call
The beast crawls as the mask falls

Skull crushed by my axe
Bones splinter, decapitation
Sockets empty, eyes sucked out
Brain consumed, pure ecstasy

All victims I made, all bodies I rape
I sodomise their flesh and leave them to ash

Bodies pinned to the ground
Faces of fear a heavenly sight
Suffocation by their own blood
See the suffering I masturbate

All victims I made, all bodies I rape
I sodomise their flesh and leave them to ash

Psychedelic reflections, strive after perfection
Outrageous necrolust, developing my consciousness

In the shadows I await for thee
My hunger crawls for thy flash

Psychedelic reflections, strive after perfection
Outrageous necrolust, developing my consciousness

Mesmerised by innocence
Corrosion of virgin flesh
Versatile ways to slay
Transfixed, deflowered death

Bodies pinned to the ground
Faces of fear a heavenly sight
Suffocation by their own blood
See the suffering I masturbate

All victims I made, all bodies I rape
I sodomise their flesh and leave them to ash

The hunger I can't deny
Schizophrenic life
