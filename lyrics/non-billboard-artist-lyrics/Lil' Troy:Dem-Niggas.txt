Dem-Niggas:Lil' Troy
A ha
Yeah, for all y'all
Most difficult

Fuck dem niggas, we roll with enough of niggas
And got problems with a couple of niggas
But fuck dem niggas, they gonna have to take chillin' with us
Or they gonna have to face dealing with us

Fuck dem niggas, we roll with enough of niggas

I'm the master mind, get money leave the past behind
'Cause if you fuck me then that ass is mine
I lay down shit Lil' Troy who I stay down with
Artist, I'm still one thick

He told me to bring, well, here it go I run shit
You bustas please ain't done shit
We authentic time peace ice up to fice up
I'm still here who lights up

Goin' on, somebody turn the lights up
Is the mic up I can't be touched
You got cash, well, it can't be much
You missed us

I'm the same one playin' me close
I told ya it ain't done
I bring the rain if I cock back
I'm the aim one, the thing to ask if I want it I bring the Axe

You niggas can't fuck with me
I put it down real so my nigga Troy stuck with me
I cut for him and now he cut for me
Grim got the keyboard, I got the razor blade to match
I got the Lacy drop hits on the track

Fuck dem niggas, we roll with enough of niggas
And got problems with a couple of niggas
But fuck dem niggas, they gonna have to take chillin' with us
Or they gonna have to face dealing with us

Fuck dem niggas man
Even though I had to front some niggas
I'll take out a bunch of ya niggas, you know, I'm Lil' Troy
I don't want none of you niggas, I will kill everyone of you niggas

Why you bumpin' 'cause you moved up to score a half a brick
Bitch I move three half a lick
I.D. you know the rules get your mutherfuckin' ass in line
And have my mutherfuckin' cash on time

Don't forget who you call when them niggas drink pistol whip
Tied you up and didn't even reason kid
I paid the price Gill bitch, I saved your life
Now you're thinkin' everything's all right

When I caught you off tha soft and a pistol bumpin' you all
Another reason I should bump you off, well, I ain't sayin' no more
I know you better start payin' me though
'Cuz bitch I ain't playin' no more

I done down to pull one, unload a clip popin' a good one
You niggas can't fuck with us
This Short Stop baby, you ain't got enough of us
You want to bring it ain't shit to me

I roll one deep but you better have a click for me
'Cuz if I get crunk I pop the trunk
I'm artist that's Troy but we both stay nonchalant
You don't know how far our money extend

When you pushin' tha Benz I'm ridin' shotgun
Cop in twins, he got a case I've got to die for the ends
It was a half of a meal from the jump when he started to burn
One lick was three and a quarter to burn

Throw three hundred in the aisle these niggas got full like that
I drink but I don't get full like that
I stay sober when it's good for me
And grab my glock and make sure I put enough on me

Fuck dem niggas
Yeah, fuck these niggas
You know what I'm sayin', we roll with enough of niggas
And 'um, I'm takin' contracts out
Every motherfuckin' body that owns somebody in this bitch

You know what I'm sayin', come see Lil' Troy
I don't care if you on the
East side, west side, north side or south side
If you a hoe ass nigga
I'm taking y'all ass out for the 99 bitch
