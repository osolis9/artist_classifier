How-Excellent:Knowdaverbs
Don't forgot that, that the name is excellent
How excellent is the name?
Every knee shall bow and all tongue shall confess
That Christ is the King, yeah

I long to know Your ways and trace the pace
That You've imprinted, Your living proof of grace
I look for Your face every minute
I chalk it up as an example of a chance
I didn't miss looking back at the past
From the future or present tense

As I abide in You, You search my heart
For what I needed to survive like You
Off every word that had proceeded
I said before, I fast slow depending not on bread alone
But imitate Your character while pursuing to clone

Their brains are veggie
If they claim You're a tale that's produced
Even Judy must judge You guilty
Of nothing but fine fruits

I suppose that's why they journey
On hopeless capers
They can't figure You out with spare hands
And scratch paper

Behold as it was written
God the Father sent the gift in His Word
Became flesh and very breath was You livin'

We were blessed with the begotten
Shone the light upon the spot
When the scene was looking rotten
Just in time You seemed to pop in
Mellow on Your entrance
Humble record was stainless certified man

Genuine divine simultaneous, I live more abundant
Since I gave You my life we're romantically involved
And I can constantly survive

The excellency of Your name
Can never be in question
You collided with the cross
And sealed it all through resurrection

You changed the world with the assignment
That had to be finished before I set foot on the earth
Then all my sins had been diminished
I stand unashamed and bless Your name with true gratis

Counting it gain to be accused
As Christ apparatus
How can some turn away
From the magnitude of your greatness?
You offer refuge and strength
Burdens gone while feeling weightless

In the middle of Your presence
Demons shake and get tense to me
Your corner stone to others, rock of offense
You declared me with thoughts
I didn't think it was such
Now call me righteous, Your grace is way too much

Think of exchange rates
It's truly the best offer, I confess You before men
You vouch for me before the Father
I shall enter Your courts with praise and doin' rhymes
'Cause it's impossible to say thank You too many times
