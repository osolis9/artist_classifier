The-End-of-the-Show-Live-:Arabesque
The end of the show
It has to be
It has to be
The end of the show
We'd love to stay
But we must say
The end of the show
We want you to know
We really have to go

Tell us, folks, did you like our song and dance
(The show is over now)
May we hope today we've found new friends
(We have to leave you now)

We really felt at home tonight
We hope you like our show alright
But now it's time to say good night

The end of the show
It has to be
It has to be
The end of the show
We'd love to stay
But we must say
The end of the show
We want you to know
We really have to go

You're so nice, we hope you had a good time
(We have to leave you now)
We're so glad that you are feeling fine
(The show is over now)

We really felt at home tonight
We hope you like our show alright
But now it's time to say good night

The end of the show
It has to be
It has to be
The end of the show
We'd love to stay
But we must say
The end of the show
We want you to know
We really have to go

The end of the show
We want you to know
We really have to go
That's the end of the show
That's the end of the show
The end of the show
