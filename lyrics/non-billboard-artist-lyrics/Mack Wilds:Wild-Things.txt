Wild-Things:Mack Wilds
So we ball and pop champagne and wait
See I've never been a drinker but a nigga taste
But I'm fine fly guy just to taste ya
Any place wanna be taken
In my mind all I see is dollars and lace
This bad chick just started waving
The crowed running as I make my way
I said hey little mama come before danger
You come around the more I want just a day
The way you looking got me wanting to play
Where are you from so tell me where do you stay

The wild things, the wild things
The wild things, the wild things

Come along I tell you a story of greatness
A young nigga want me to stay
From the niggas would frown down in hating
The clown and pussy niggas scared the same
All around the kids hang around and play
5 rounds and you never came
Couple million but he never made it
It's a nightmare thinking that you were famous
Excuse me cutie oh you want the same
You're sounding like a [?] I need a day
The way you looking got me wanting to play
Where are you from now tell me where do you stay

The wild things, the wild things
The wild things, the wild things

Come from the crown side
The New York town side
West side till I di-e
I grew up hearing that Wu-not
Watching that cop that
You feel like cooking this
Hercules get a hand God damn
Nigga y'all be cupped to make some rain rat
My whole hood jumping out
Yes I did that
Why these ladies wanna cover on my balls back
Skin rebel smooth like butter
Coming from the city where most blocks is amended
We believed there was no need for change
Believe the change and wash it arrange
Pop shot popping only means one thing

The wild things, the wild things
The wild things, the wild things

Walk in the scrap and fucking alley
The duck rat you chick
Fuck boy now it's your work for this little shit
