Certified, just to say the least
Do or die, bonafied
Opposite, opposite
Theater order and they work in the street
Head on the table, with a little one, a little underneath
Big Willy now pretty Ricky
Roll around with Dal and Nicky
Now picky, that’s just how the game taught em
But don’t say his name ‘cause everybody call him

Her, she came up the old school way
Started out in the cut, out in the cut
Movin pass tricks, the easiest way
A smile on that big old butt
Was another floor, that bubble, see
Because they all seemed magnetized
And when a woman’s touch is so soft
But it’s all just a sacrifice
For her to speed dial

Now this one here’s a cold piece
This mama’s little hustling man
Had all the threads and even ball gold teeth
And he wanted to be so grand
Man this is what you call a dreamer
Tryna make a fantasy come true
But know and behold, it wasn’t in his soul
No matter what he tried no matter what he tried
He spread his name across the game and even paid for a little respect
Just tryna buy what money cannot buy
They still ain’t love that yet
They’ll never be
