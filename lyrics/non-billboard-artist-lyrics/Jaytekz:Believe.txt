Ya, 20 years gone by and shit I'm growin' up I gotta stop and ask myself how you holdin' up
This shit is crazy man, everything is passing by, my loved ones are growing old and it makes me cry
Cause I've had lost so many people in my life, and I'm tired of letting go, even if it's right
I just want you all to know, I'm sorry for my wrongs, I never meant to cause you any pain or no harm
And god, I just pray you got me through, I dropped out of school and now I know just what to do
My Grandma tells me "
Go back, Your waisting all your time" I try to pay no mind, but I gotta draw the line
I'm working with these rhymes, but this is just the moment, I'm sacrificing so much so I can finally own it
"When I make it?", I guess only time could tell, I just hope it ain't too late before this ship has sailed.
(Some kind of gay song)
