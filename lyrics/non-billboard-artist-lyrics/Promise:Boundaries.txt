Boundaries:Promise
Something big and wide
Surrounding my life
Every where I turn
There is a giant wall
I am surrrounded by boundaries
I beg and plead
Please let me go
I want to live my life
Like no one else

Boundaries
Surrounding me
Please!
Just let me go
Please let me go

These boundaries
Are absorbing my energy
I feel weak

I will break through
I will not be caged forever
These boundaries cannot hold me
Let me go!
Now!
Or! not!
I will break through!
I am invincible
I am invincible

These boundaries will break
My heart will not ache
You cannot!
Shake me!
I will not break down!
Down!
Down!
Down!
I will not break down!
Down!
No! I will not!
I will not!
Break!
Down!

These boundaries
Will break but not me!
But not me!
These boundaries will snap like twigs!
These boundaries
Will break!

I will not snap
I will not break
I will not cry
I will not shake
Because I am strong!

These boundaries will break

They cannot hold me forever
They will fall someday
