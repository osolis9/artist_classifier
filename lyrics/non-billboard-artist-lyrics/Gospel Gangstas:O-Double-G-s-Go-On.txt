O Double G's Go On
tryin to stay Saved in South Central 
where survival is an everyday thing and its weighin on my mental 
everywhere you step brothas trying to get a rep 
and they'll rold ya, fold ya, for a stripe on they shoulder 
told ya that i used to fornicate like i was born to mate 
now Jezebel wanna see if Solo really creep 
well, now i watch my back when i bail 
cuz theres alot a Delilahs out to cut your homie pigtails 
as far as meetin in a joint of weed 
gotta meet me at my point of need, so i plead 
the Blood if i have to, dont let these demons grab you 
watch till you inverse then kiss your face and backstab you 
see frustration tried to beat me down, keep me down 
said id never make it thru, but peep me now 
i got my homies, my vision, and i got God too 
eyes to the skies, Gs rise as i mobs thru 
O Double Gs go on (on and on) 
in the Lord, standin strong (everlasting) 
O Double Gs stand strong (stand strong) 
cuz once again its on (no need in asking) 
its been a long time comin, now were here 
full gear, no fear, sheddin tears for my peers 
down in my convergin, it cut me like a surgeon 
said im no good for churchin, only good for servin 
(see) the death in my mind for the Martial Arts is set-o 
said id never make it cuz i grew up in a ghetto 
attack my self esteem in a evil way 
they'll kill your dreams if you listen to what people say 
see God called me with a Holy callin 
He snatched me out the gang and 
cleaned me up to witness to my homies bawlin 
so dont get caught up in your past failures 
when you feelin like you wont last, tell ya 
self "ima make it" when satan say you cant take it 
and if the spot get too hot shake it 
cuz sometimes we all need some help 
but when i feel like givin up i tell my self 
chorous
a troubled youth from the CPT 
it makes my family feel good when they see me free 
i was wrote off, they said "leave him alone" 
i had no love at home so i hugged my crome 
through bad situations and tribulations 
now God is using them to bring thousands to Salvation 
ive been lied on by ignorance and jealousy 
you got a problem with my crew just come and tell us G 
it pierce us deeply, peep me, i mean it hurts, loc 
to get dogged by your own, talk to church folk 
bound to religion, quick to make decisions 
about the Call of God in my life and the vision 
but who but a x-Blood could reach a cobdu 
you wont leave your pew then you criticize what i do 
try to understand if you could 
if not you can catch me in the hood 
cuz im goin on
