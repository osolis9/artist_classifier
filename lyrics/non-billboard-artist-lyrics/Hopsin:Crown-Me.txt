Crown-Me:Hopsin
Yo, let me take you to the tribe real quick

I'm from that small city called Panorama
Where the vatos roam and they blast they hammers
Never had no sense, so I'm bad with manners
Who would've thought I'd be living life in the fashion cameras?
Got bitches on my nuts like pubics! (ooh)
Niggas could never figure me out like Rubix!(cubes)
I be bullying everybody like I'm Brutus! (who?)
So don't under-estimate me, I do this! Truest
I'm calm and ill, but still drop bombs, I kill
You know the deal, with my godly skills
You want a dog to fill in my shoes?
That's a lot to fill. It won't happen, you cannot be real
There's so many rappers that wanna catch my fame
So many bitches, that wanna sketch my brain
I'll probably end up on the news dead, bullet in the head
Mama in the street yelling, "That's my baby!"
Want me to keep it to a minimum, with the syllables?
I think you should get up off my genitals
Every nigga identical, when they spit a flow
This shit is critical, I'ma have to get rough, get on my sentinal
Nigga, what you be sipping on? I'm guessing your pen is broke
Is it difficult for you to get better? You're so despicable
Cause your shit is boo-boo, your bars are predictable
I do not bump it. It's hard to get into you
Please admit it. Man the voyage is radical
Mind is set to just destroy. I'm an animal
I'm killing shit, I'm a poisonous antidote
I be on it, man ya boy's international
Yeah I'm mad with rhymes
Been doin' this since '99, I'm a mastermind
Homie, it's 2015, and all my niggas gon' kill it
When they finish the job, the other half is mine
Fools

You ain't on that real shit
I live here. You on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo girl need a real dick
It's no doubt, niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a lil bit
I serve you. You get the bill quick
Crown me, I'm a real prince

Give me that crown boy! (give it!)
I said give me that shit!
Give me that crown boy! (come on!)
I said give me that shit!
Give me that crown boy! (give it!)
I said give me that shit!
Give me that crown boy! (come on!)
I said give me that shit!

The rap game's mine. I revolve it
'Round me. I think I have lost it
And my mind's exhausted, I'm nauseous
From the process of hopping on stage
And trying to dive in moshpits
Nigga, why you focused on diamonds?
These cubic zirconias is all up in my ear
Over jewelry, I don't get excited
My perception in life, is "why the fuck am I here, nigga?"
I've been this way since your ass has been sucking on titties
Since niggas cocked back, and start bustin' on Fifty
Since J-Lo was mobbin' in public with Diddy
Since Biggie and Pac got shot up, it's a pity
That's bullshit you're talking. I'm not in the mood, bro
Continue yapping, you'll see Hopsin is brutal
Keep pushin' me, you gon' get dropped with some drool though
You fannin' out like you want cock in yo culo
Niggas only in it, for money and bitches
I don't even think they wanna rap no more
But they wanna be all over the television
Rockin' feminine shit, trying to act homo
Old bi-ass niggas, can't bypass niggas
"I can't change even if I tried"-ass niggas
Tight jeans on, so they show your ass-ass niggas
In the pool with the homie, trying to splash-ass niggas
Fruity as Mike and Ike, you'll get diced to rice
When I arrive, I pull up like,"Hi! Surprise!"
It might be wise to hide, when the nightly skies
Are high. Fuckin' with an 8, no life for Pi
Tell me. What position would the game be in
Without me having the ability to raise the pen?
Pound Syndrome. This is it, I'm weighin' in
I still hate ya'll niggas, and I can't pretend
Fool

You ain't on that real shit
I live here. You on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo girl need a real dick
It's no doubt, niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a lil bit
I serve you. You get the bill quick
Crown me, I'm a real prince

Give me that crown boy! (give it!)
I said give me that shit!
Give me that crown boy! (come on!)
I said give me that shit!
Give me that crown boy! (give it!)
I said give me that shit!
Give me that crown boy! (come on!)
I said give me that shit!
