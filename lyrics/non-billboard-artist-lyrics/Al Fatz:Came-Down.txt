Came-Down:Al Fatz
Yea
Hey
It's your boy Fat Al
This song right here, know what I'm sayin'
For all my hustlers that be comin' down
You comin' down and you play this song right here
Open 'em up, even if the police behind you
The doors should be open
You need to be swangin', this how we do it in Cleveland

Hey
It's the Fat Al
And I'm from the slab
First nigga put 28's on the jag
20's on the Lac
24's on the cuddy
Pull up in the brown car look like a nutty butty
Now I got some buddies that love the cap and
They love the Fat Al just because the nigga rap
Nigga stay strap and I ain't talkin' about the guns
Look when I stop, how my rims just run

Niggas comin' up some niggas comin' down
Look at the tall trucks got surround sound
If you talkin' down then u get a beat down
Stop Sprewell spinnin' then I'm clappin' on you clowns
I am a winner, you are a beginner

Look how I stop oh blind by my spinners

Look at me, damn, better make a killin' man
When I stop 28's look like a ceiling fan

Pull up in the Sunday these boys can't top it
Paint is vanilla while my seats is dark chocolate
When it comes to cappin' you niggas switch the topic
When it comes to this rappin' they know that I'm the hottest
Tryin' to make a profit boy you better stop it
Touch my hustle man these niggas can't knock it
I'm in the droppin' matter fact I'm mobbin'
Trunk hit so hard that I thought I did a drop kick
Look at the time you know I'm a shine

See me ridin' in the cuddy with the boy vibe

I said the cuddy don't forget rich B
Cause he comin' down slidin' in a grand prix

Earn got the Monty C and Mike got the 8 ball

Phil slide backwards that mean we got balls
Nigga hate on ya'll I think naw
Matter fact when I stop I get applause

I done came down
I done came down
I done
I done
