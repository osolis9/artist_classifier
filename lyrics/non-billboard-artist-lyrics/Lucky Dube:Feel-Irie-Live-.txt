Feel-Irie-Live-:Lucky Dube
How long shall you carry that burden on your shoulders?
How long shall those tears keep running down
Your beautiful face? We all have troubles
Now and again, know what I'm saying?

No matter how hard we try
Trouble will find us
One way or another people had troubles
Since the Pope was an altar boy

People had worries from
When the Dead Sea was only wrinkled
Hear those drums running
And listen to those guitars skanking

Yeah, put a smile on your face
Don't let the troubles get you down
Shoop shoop doo doo
Put a smile on your face
Don't let the troubles get you down

Let me tell you how we feel
We feel Irie, Irie
We feel Irie, Irie
We feel Irie, yeah yeah, Irie
We feel so Irie, Irie

Tell me, do you feel like we do?
Do you feel like we do?
I say, do you feel like we do?

No man can hide from his fears
Since they are part of him
They always know where to find him
Come on walk tall and, keep your head high

I tell you again and again
Put a smile on your face
Don't let the troubles get you down
Shoop shoop doo doo
Put a smile on your face
Don't let the troubles get you down

We feel Irie, Irie
We feel Irie, yeah, Irie
We feel Irie, Irie
We feel Irie, yeah, irie

Tell me, do you feel like we do?
Do you feel like we do?
Tell me now, do you feel like we do?

'Cause we feel Irie, Irie
We feel Irie, yeah, Irie
We feel Irie, Irie
We feel so Irie, Irie

Do you feel like we do?
Listen now, put a smile on your face
Don't let the troubles get you down
Shoop shoop doo doo

Put a smile on your face
Don't let the troubles get you down
Shoop shoop doo doo
Put a smile on your face
Don't let the troubles get you down
Shoop shoop doo doo
