Greatest-Man-Alive-After-Midnight-mix-:Three Times Dope
(EST the Acknickulous One)
(I'm) (the greatest man alive)
(EST the Unusual Fellow)
Landscapin, mentally shapin
Get the gist, don't miss what I'm sayin
Hilltop bringin in the bass drop
Soakin up saps like a household mop
Out to romp, stomp, so you're no comp
You try to rock, we bump, the whole house jump
Gotta bust a sucker or else it gets borin
Just like you people need your coffee in the mornin
And every word is honestly stated
You get it not synthetic or fabricated
Keep your eyes open, I got you on a scope
Know it like a poet cause I'm diddy-do-dope
Fly like a falcon, strong like a stallion
Now all I need is a gold medaillon
Providin small time suckers with info
EST's the unusual fellow
(Definitely the best thing that's happening)
Yes it's the ES, the man you can't understand
Much funky on your FM band
The brown-eyed bombshell rockin you well
Disignitin all bitin and frontin as well
We propel our records to sell
Like a speedy Lamborghini we're bound to excel
Given the chance to shake your pants is somethin that you'll never forget
I make you wake up in a cold sweat
Drippin with the fluid that wets you when you do it
Know this like Otis when your style is bogus
Love to party with a girlie with a dope body
Gotta bite my tongue, I'm so high-strung
ES the name, knockin boots is the game
If you ain't a queen I love ya just the same
My name is ESTizinizm, cold gettin bizinizm
Rallyin the funky dope razzamatizm
Hit you with the hardest, comin with the clarity
Skyin over suckers, defyin all laws of gravity
The style of my hair like a new wave afro
EST's the unusual fellow
(He's too good to be true)
With a ultra fresh topic for this here recital
With another one of those crazy fresh titles
It'll be shakin up and it'll be takin up
Space in the race cause the sinister'll crank it up
EST is the one that's so original
The boy so live should have his name on your cereal
Instead of Swatch you wear a sinister watch
Worn by the suckers who be swearin they clock
Cause ain't nobody takin my place, you know what I mean?
Instead of Guess you wear some ES jeans
Tight around your putang, so when you shake that thang
Everybody wants you shake it again
Feel it shuttin up in my bones
Magically moved by the microphone
At first I just twitch then I get that itch
And real quick you see me flickin up the on-switch
Sweatin like a dog in front of sell-out crowds
Dippin em all in the 3-D style
No matter how you hype up your twelve inch, they don't get it
They want my album, you gotta deal with it
You coulda had yours out but now I took ya
Still ain't got one out cause you're chasin funky hookers
And all the real slimmies jammin off my flow
EST's the unusual fellow
(EST the Acknickulous One)
(I'm) (the greatest man alive)
(He's too good to be true, he's tall, he's handsome, he's rich, exciting...)
(Definitely the best thing that's happening)
