Very-Best:Lemar
[Chorus]
She won't go, unless you make her leave
It's so clear to see
You were meant for each other
She won't cry, unless you break her heart
She's a work of art 
And she deserves the very best of you
Of you [x2]
She deserves the very best

[Verse 1]
After all she's only human
Flesh and bone
If you break the vein, the blood will flow
It could be so simple
If you say the words
She'll follow you, wherever you go
To be, where you are
Feel your arms, wrapped around her insecurities
Release any hurt, and the such
Show your baby just how much she's worth

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
A susposity, that is all she needs
She won't show, she won't go
Unless you make her leave
'Cause honestly, she's like all you need
She won't show, but she won't go
No

Yeah

[Chorus]
She won't go, unless you make her leave
It's so clear to see
You were meant for each other
She won't cry, unless you break her heart
She's a work of art 
And she deserves the very best of you
Of you [x2]
She deserves the very best of you
Of you [x2]
She deserves, she deserves, she deserves the very best of you
Of you [x2]
