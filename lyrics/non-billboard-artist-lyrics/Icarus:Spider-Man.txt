Spider-Man:Icarus
Gonna catch a fly
Right between the eyes
Crawling up the walls
And man, that's not all! 

His secret senses tell him what to do
Who's that punk - a man in red and blue?
Spider-Man is going to prowl
Oh, look out
The web's behind you now!

Gonna catch a fly
Woah, right between the eyes
Crawling up the walls
And man, that's not all

He's always weaving in and out of town
Jonah's always trying to put him down
Spider-Man is going to prowl!
Oh, look out the web's behind you now! 

Wow, look out!

His secret senses tell him what to do
Who's that punk - a man in red and blue?
Spider-Man is going to prowl!
Oh look out, the web's behind you now!

Oh, look out! Look out!
