Fall-Reaching:Chris Ward
Eight years old with my Louisville slugger
My Daddy said "Keep your eye on the ball
There'll be times when you lose the big game
But keep your chin up whenever you fall"

If you're gonna win, win graceful
If you're gonna love, love faithful
If you're gonna learn, learn by teaching
If you're gonna fall, fall reaching

High school dance hiding out in the corner
She said "hello" and I fell apart
I took her hand and I held it forever
Love will find you if you believe in your heart

If you're gonna win, win graceful
If you're gonna love, love faithful
If you're gonna learn, learn by teaching
If you're gonna fall, fall reaching

I've been out in the back yard
Playin' ball with my son
Teachin' him all that I know
He sits down beside me
And says "You're pretty good, Dad
But you've still got a long way to go"

If you're gonna win, win graceful
If you're gonna love, love faithful
If you're gonna learn, learn by teaching
If you're gonna fall, fall reaching

If you're gonna fall, fall reaching
