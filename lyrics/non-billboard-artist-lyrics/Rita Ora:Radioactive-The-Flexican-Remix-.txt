Radioactive-The-Flexican-Remix-:Rita Ora
Palms to the sky
We unite
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Fe-feeling it
We rise tonight
I'm checking you out in your sweet desire
I'm coming over to make you mine
It's a crime boy, you so fine
I'm checking you out, boy it's a green light its bright
I'm glad you came over, it was about time
It feels right, boy you're so fine
This love's radioactive
Drop the bomb, let me feel the beat
This love's radioactive
Drop the bomb, let me feel the beat
Palms to the sky
You and I
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Fe-feeling it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Fe-feeling it
We rise tonight
Moving on beat as the world ends
This nuclear heat is a beautiful end
You might not live to tell, el, el, el, el, el, el
This love's radioactive
Drop the bomb, let me feel the beat
This love's radioactive
Drop the bomb, let me feel the beat
Palms to the sky
You and I
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Fe-feeling it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Fe-feeling it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
You, you, you, you and I
Palms to the sky
You, you, you, you and I
Palms to the sky
You, you, you, you and I
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
You and I
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Fe-feeling it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Fe-feeling it
We rise tonight
We unite
You and I react tonight
We unite
You and I react tonight
We unite
You and I react tonight
