Fantasea:Azealia Banks
A passion for like fantastic
Less they gonna go basket, next to go
I’ma hug against the good life, exelo
Hey, feel better than exing blow
Get high from a line turn text to notes
See these niggas gased up like Texaco
Watch your bitch pulling pepsico
Ever since it was a nbo
Had magic glow, young dynamo
Young fool, young ...with the finer flow
Young rapping doe, never will, never half a hoe
Give me celebrate and have a toast
Young sister...

Boy me and you, oh
So close to the moon
It’s okay for you
Close to the moon
And I wannna take you so close
Tryina say I’m here to find fantasia
I’m here to find fantasea

Fast forward live half your life
No wrong cause the cash was right
Have a bitch bling twice like ...
More than weekly pass the fights
Non believers on astronome
Burning people like Fahrenheit
Run the world like Santa like
Baby girl got, baby girl got options
Right Dj to the beat, H pass the light
Far from the passive type
I excite your life and ass it
Better than your average
That is ...the ship..imagine
Everything you want, you can have it
Trip, trip, trip, you on a magic
Do you really, really want the ....
Growing in the passion, ...
Numbers on the masses, words of the ...
Anything you want is established
Anything you want you can have it

Boy me and you, oh

And I wannna take you so close
