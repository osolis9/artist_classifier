STRETCH YOUR HAND TO THE EVIL!
LOOK UP TO THE SKY,
RAISE UP YOUR DARK RESPECT!
DREAM THE REDEMPTION,
BUT HE DOESN'T COME!
ROTTING CHURCH OF YOUR DYING HEART
BECAME TORMENTING PRISON OF YOUR SOUL.
THE WORLD EXPEL YOU FROM ITSELF,
YOU ARE SWEPT AWAY ALONE
DARK RIVER'S WATER BURNS COLDLY
IN YOUR ANGELIC FACE.
NOW, LET IT TO TAKE AWAY,
UNFOLD YOUR DARK WINGS IN THE BLACK SKY!
FLY WITHOUT RESTRICTION ABOVE
THE GODLESS PLAINS AND WATERS!
BLAZE THE FIRE IN YOURSELF,
CONSUME YOU THE PAINFUL RAPTURE!
STRETCH YOUR HAND TO THE EVIL!
CLEAVE INTO YOU THE ARROW OF HATRED,
THROW YOUR TORTURES OFF...
THROW YOUR TORTURES OFF!
STRETCH YOUR HAND TO THE EVIL!
CLEAVE INTO THE ARROW OF HATRED,
THROW YOUR TORTURES OFF...
THROW YOUR TORTURES OFF!
THE RESPECT OF YOUR GLOWING EYES
BECOME LIGHT
ON THE COLD ROCKS OF UNIVERSE,
THE EYE OF MOON!
YOUR BLOOD GIVES DRINK TO THE SUN,
THE NIGHTFALL BECOME BLOODRED,
FOREVER...
...BLOODRED FOREVER
