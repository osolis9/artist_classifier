Ain't no rules or parameters, professional, we pity the amateur
'Bout time I get some cunk, fifty might some slug in my cross bugs

Ain't here to assassinate your character more like erase ya
From paper whenever there's a problem with troublemakers
Certified hitman ain't no store pipe paid Blacktalians Rhinos

All we did was dis dude

'Cause Twayne hooked up with Armstrong this game in trouble
Yah, I'm the scoop that sat beside the double
Doors and let in all the bros
It's you and I done forgot about the struggle
In the corner swinging like aluminum loaded slugs
Focused next on your jugular
