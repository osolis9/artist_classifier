Whoa-Now:B-Rich
To the east side, we finally got a piece of the pie

Watch these come an' gettin' 'em know fo sho
Yo, get your back up off the wall an' get your feet on the floor
You see the boy at the bar with the glass so tall
When I'm done, baby dog, I'ma show you Baltimore

Right now, we gonna party, Bacardi gimme some more
It's off the rack the club packed, I'm two cut like two doors
Of course, I do my two step, give 'em too much
I mustered up bad, I drop ashes in my cup

I had enough they throwin' boes, see, I'm swingin' this chick
I had my arm around this smut game puttin' in work
Before we work I got to book somethin', so baby, stop frontin'
I got the drink an' the smoke ain't got to buy nothin', not bluffin'

It's goin' down understand me, I like my birds nasty
I burst in them cashmeres, everything
An' you know what I came for
Right now, it's goin' down, let me on the dance floor

Whoa now, that's what the old men say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin' an' still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty gimme what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin' hot

Whoa now, that's what the old men say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin' an' still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty gimme what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin' hot

I came to shake a load off, so take your coat off
Mix drinks what you think, OJ an' Smirnoff
I sip it all, hey, what can I say, see I just got paid
So I'm feelin' the swig an' I'm tryin' get laid

I'm buyin' drinks and they love it
Divas growin' cheaper, hoochie bag and hoochie bucket
Takin' shots from my cousin, he don't know how to act
Came straight out the woods an' the club with a sack

Like what you know, no good but I know, I'd give 'em back
Sneakers is off the meter, you can't help with the clap
Can't help but the boogie, get loose but don't push me
We came so deep an' we're all wearin' hoodies

All my eighty-dime soldiers what you doin' tonight
Now, put yo' eight-dimes up, you made enough for the night
Let's take a break, let's spend some cake, you ain't enjoyin' your life
Yo, we been workin' all week so we gon' do it tonight, come on

Whoa now, that's what the old men say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin' an' still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty gimme what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin' hot

Whoa now, that's what the old men say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin' an' still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty gimme what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin' hot

All my east-side boys, put ya' guns up, pull out the knife
'Cuz we gonna party till the law comes them boys yellin'
"Where they from?" I represent too
They throwin' game signs, see, I'm throwin' W's

I'm screamin' eighty-dubs, I swear to God it's goin' down
I don't remember where I parked and I'm stuck in town
One night in Baltimore, I bet ya' never leave
My boy, I know, I can't help it but to love these streets

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, whoa now
C'mon, c'mon, whoa now , whoa now
C'mon, c'mon, whoa now, that's what the old men say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin' an' still thirsty

Whoa now, that's what the old men say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin' an' still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty gimme what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin' hot

Whoa now, that's what the old men say
I party like it's my birthday, drinkin' an' still thirsty
Whoa now, shorty gimme what you got
The spot kinda live and I see you gettin' hot
