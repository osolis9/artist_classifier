For-The-Life-Of-Me:Horrorshow
I can't for the life of me
I can't for the life of me
Strutting on the sidewalk, stuck up in a time warp
Waiting on the sky fall any minute now
You can't get your mind off, something in your blind spot
What you gonna die for? Better work it out
(But every once in a while)
Still find that I got a reason to smile
'Cause I know that one of these days I'll be going on a date
(Yeah, we'll be going out in style)
With a fly lady by the name of Fate
And for my own sake, well I hope she running late

I see it before it happens
Having visions, premonitions and they always coming true
They always coming true
I see it ‘fore it happens
Having premonitions and yeah they always coming true
(Tell me what am I to do)

And I still can't figure out why
In the end I'ma say my goodbye
As I throw my peace sign to the sky
Singing "I can't for the life of me"
Yeah, I still can't figure out why
In the end I'ma say my goodbye
As I throw my peace sign to the sky
Singing "I can't for the life of me"

This ain't the time for stage fright, falling by the wayside
Baby this is game time, better knuckle down
Dunno how they take life, me I'm tryna save mine
'Cause I know that day by day it's running out
But the thing is that I still can't figure out if my head would fit the crown
If they ever make me ruler ‘fore they put me in the ground
(Simmer down) 'Cause letting those sort of thoughts weigh you down
Is played out like rap songs ‘bout back in the day and living in the now
You can say I'm living in the past
But see, that's only half the truth
Because I'm living in the future boy
Look behind you, good sir, I'm surpassing you

I see it before it happens
Having visions, premonitions and they always coming true, they always coming true
I see it ‘fore it happens
Having premonitions and yeah they always coming true
(Tell me what am I to do now)
No need for hesitation, just let me set it straight
A little meditation mixed in with the celebration
Our spot is not yet vacant, the stakes is high
It's a percentage game, we play it every day
And everywhere's the same, ‘How are you?' ‘Who me? Never better.'
Then proceed to make a bit of small talk about the weather
While we living in the future, past, present and forever right
We still can't figure out the question ‘Why?'

Singing I can't for the life of me
I can't for the life of me
I can't for the life of me
I can't for the life of me (I can't for the life of me, oh no)
I can't for the life of me (I can't for the life of me, oh-)
Tell me what am I to do?
And I still can't figure out why
In the end I'ma say my goodbye
As I throw my peace sign to the sky
Singing "I can't for the life of me"
Yeah, I still can't figure out why
In the end I'ma say my goodbye
As I throw my peace sign to the sky
Singing "I can't for the life of me"

I can't for the life of me
I can't for the life of me
I can't for the life of me
I can't for the life...
