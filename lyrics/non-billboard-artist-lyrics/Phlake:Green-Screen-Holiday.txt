Green-Screen-Holiday:Phlake
Ho-holiday
My house, my couch

Into my green screen life
We could go where you like
On holiday, holiday
Holiday, holiday
You could bring your bathing suit
We don't have to leave this room
Going loud right now
We're going loud right now

Loud from the Taj Mahal
To the Eiffel Tower
We don't have to fly
'Cause we on green screen
Living life on Mars
Checking out the Mardi Gras
We don't need no cars, no
'Cause we on green screen

Ho-holiday, it's true
Every night like deja vu
We can order your favourite food
All day, it's a holiday
Picture me on dancing poles
On the cover of Rolling Stone
Going loud right now
We're going loud right now

Loud from the Taj Mahal
To the Eiffel Tower
We don't have to fly, no
'Cause we on green screen
Living life on Mars
Checking out the Mardi Gras
We don't need no cars, no
'Cause we on green screen

Ho-holiday
Holiday, holiday
'Cause we on green screen
Ho-holiday
Holiday, holiday
'Cause we on green screen
Ho-holiday

We could go to outer space
This room is my favourite place
Let's travel and hibernate
We're going loud right now

Loud from the Taj Mahal
To the Eiffel Tower
We don't have to fly, no
'Cause we on green screen
Living life on Mars
Checking out the Mardi Gras
We don't need no cars, no
'Cause we on green screen

Ho-holiday
Holiday, holiday
'Cause we on green screen
Ho-holiday
Holiday, holiday
'Cause we on green screen
Ho-holiday

Holiday, holiday
Ho-holiday
'Cause we on green screen
Ho-holiday
