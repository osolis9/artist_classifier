(Verse)
Respect is well deserved, our urge is power
Only super-group you ever heard was ours
You need to do community service hours
But in the box put funeral service flowers
My girl been pregnant, I'm up long, my unborn 
Is been better than you over drums without his lungs formed
We have lined it up the gartner with one song
When you referring to the garden, it's a front lawn
Got the nets on, the bucks on it, drinks spillin' cause
The speakers got yo cups on it
Had the feature on your song, now the clubs want it
Your song ain't jump off till I jump on it
Most of those among us, folks at home are younger now
It's pokin' nose in summer, tamper bay, lightnin' beemer
Oklahoma thunder, that's the only bad weather
Doing coca-cola numbers

(Hook)
I'm broke, the monkey got stroke, they all went to hell
And the mineral woke
The water rise, the bull pack size
Lies, disguise, sweet potato fries
(Serve 'em up)
Disguise, sweet potato fries
(Serve 'em up)
Disguise, sweet potato fries
(Serve 'em up)
Disguise, sweet potato fries
(Serve 'em up)
These guys just don't give a f&*()

(Verse)
Before ever, my style be hot until the casket drop
All these wax shit need to stop
Y'all can invest, I don't care how many shares you got
Cause I'm quick to loose entrance, you a laughin' stock
Y'all actin' like the trash is hot, stop lyin'
The booth, I'mma give you this work, no assignment
My vomit be as hot as the sun's climate
Y'all can gossip, I'm a star that dies - homage
Nonsense, whores, I don't love 'em no more
I twist 'em, you cats peanuts, you done with these whores
It's funny. Must battle for money, I'm not loosin'
Cause I been gettin' bread ever since my first communion
Don't rock with you losers, although I'm not a shooter
Not a peace maker, say that for your jeweler
This punch line the ruler, I'm nice with words
Fuckin' dance around the topic, but you got served

What you're witnessing is forecast with discipline
Got a plan, to be the man like Michelin
If you're listening, left the track like Chris and Em
Got yo clap hummin' and wistlin'
Check it! Everything we spittin' is accurate, immaculate
Most cats lack on the track when they rappin' after it
Why the Doopers favored, you haters is no imaginate
You can try to race and chase but there's no catchin' it
These four pass is smashin' it
Game ain't the same, most of y'all lames won't last in it
Put yo seat belts and fasten it
EMC ride, like DUI, we crashin' it
Crashin' it, it's like a party when we're not invited
But it's not a party if the brothers never got invited
We took a brake and was not invited
Now we're back, words got us the track, it's when I got excited
Now your fan is dude nasty
First place, so please pick up the pace if you try to move past me
Now or never, let you goons gas me
I won't quit, and don't forget, I spit like the food nasty
Where we from, we never optimistic
It's like life constantly showin' it's ass, but we never stop to kiss it
Fans love it, haters op to diss it
Tryna find me? Just come to the block and visit
Take fries
