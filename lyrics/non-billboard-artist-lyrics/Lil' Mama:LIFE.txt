LIFE:Lil' Mama
[CHORUS:]
L is for the liars that have surrounded me
I insecurities my head down in these streets
F my future there isn't 1
E Eternal hope
This is my life

I wake up every day to the same old foster mother
I ain't got no pictures of my mother
She was a crack fiend nothing like Pac mother
She didn't make a difference if though she
Could've I'm a shame shame of my life
Pappa probly sold me twice
On a late night stopped by
And look in my eyes
Bags from the tears that I've cried
And the people who lied
Telling me that this is my place
Phony try smile In my face
When I should have known something
Was rare smiled when she opened the mail
Kept a nice mink on her back
Meanwhile I got a goose & my goose got patches
I'm so mad this is me
I'm so hurt this is me
So I should it be
Well I goin be alright cause

[CHORUS]

I'm pregnant by a dude & he not 16
But I like his style & his whipp is mean
My mama told me to find a man to take care
Of me & he does buy me things but he beats on me
I come to her for a little advice
So I show up with a black eye
Telling me to know my place so I stay
Waiting for my body phase
Telling myself it just a little pregnancy phase
When all in reality I'm being discourage & disrespected
And under the pressure & I don't really blame the man
I blame my mother for not teaching me the different types of man
Life never understand my side of story being that it's so consist 18 years
And 9 months developing raised in a prison I guess I'll never make a difference

[CHORUS]

Fought all with nothing to all is the least
Of my problems
Appearance like deja vu
Stomach is starving
Free lunch, breakfast, evenitally I departed
So ashamed of a life that was started
I asked God if he can take the pain away
He made me in denial of every word I pray
Every day it's the same old no talent I'm feeling like
My life is unbalanced no telling what tomorrow going look
Like yea right wrapped up in a fast life for a sudicial
Act why is my life set up for a failure I can care
Less with the people say to ya'll we break out
In rage feeling all the hurt inside who am I
To tell you what you fail to realize the voice that you hold
Within you the voice that you are
The Voice Of The Young People!

[CHORUS]
