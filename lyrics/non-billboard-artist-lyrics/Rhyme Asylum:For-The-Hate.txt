For-The-Hate:Rhyme Asylum
[Chorus]

This is hate music, punch you in the face music
Raise the murder rate music
This is put ‘em in the grave music
And we make music for the insane to relate to it
Hate music, punch you in the face music
Raise the murder rate music
Put ‘em in the grave music
And we make music for the insane, the insane

[Verse 1: Psiklone]

I train my pet hates in a steel mesh cage
Fuck a word I’ll get a bayonet blade in edgeways
Break records before they’re set straight
Watch God and Lucifer’s chess game and spot the move for the checkmate
I'll blow my fuse and knock your lights out
And push you head first off of the top of your moral high ground
You know the deal
The first man to cross the arctic dragging a hundred huskies and a snowmobile
Rancor, psychotic rapper
Swallow bottled anger and transform like Dr. Banner
Had a soul now there’s nothing left
Death penalty kick an undercover fed to a sudden death
Scared off my mirror image
I’m off the hook, while you got no conviction like you've been acquitted
Woke from the grave when I died in my sleep
Afraid of the dark? Wait 'till we finally meet

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2: Possessed]

Here’s my declaration of war, pray to The Lord
Name of my inner child, Damien Thorn
Live by the way of the sword
My name don’t ring bells (nah) it sounds Gabriel’s Horn
Chip off the old block of flats 
Lungs transform oxygen to a toxic gas (Exhales) 
Release a breath
Need to be given lethal injections every hour to keep me dead
Turn green when seeing red, beat my chest
Rub shoulders with me, freeze to death
I’m armed and dangerous
I carved the Star of David into the foreheads of master masons
Incarcerated in a mic booth
It ain’t a simile when I say I don’t like you
My IQ's double your sperm count 
Impatient, slit my throat just to get this verse out

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3: Skirmish]

We the greatest yeah you heard right, [Right] word life
Love is blind and I couldn’t see it then at first sight
‘Till I was on the receiving end of her spite
And my bitch of a better half bought out my worst side
So fuck love, we do this “For the Hate”
Call my name, the force’ll cause your jaw to break
Cross my heart hope you die
Don’t mean to tickle ribs when I say all joke aside
I’m done with the past delete history
This the clique I rep ‘till the bitter for the sweet victory
Possess the soul of whom my switchblade stabs
I’m fighting the person within in a ribcage match
[Look] I got hate in my eyes
I’m equipped with a powerful an armed and dangerous mind
So I’ma aim for the skies 
And when I shoot for the stars, over my dead body you’ll be staying alive         

[Repeat Chorus]
