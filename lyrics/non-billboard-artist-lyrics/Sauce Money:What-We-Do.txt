What-We-Do:Sauce Money
Yo,Yo Bleek man, what the fuck, Nigga
Fuck them hoes, man
Fuck them bitches, what I like?
Uh, uh,uh, uh what, what?
I bet y'all think this some love song or shit, that's a terrible mistake

I like to do twenty wild chicks, scoping my whip
Do shows across the country, get dough for my shit
Looking in the face of rappers, hopping I quit
Still spit the fly shit to keep them grousing my hits

I like to neva eva let my tounge touch in the sex
Like to exercise one a week, say fuck it the next
Like to write four whole songs, three skits a day
Talk shit with Tyrina and do hits with J

I like to write for other people, keep 'em loving a nigga
On the low love the dough between my publish and bigga
Is it wroth a million yet that's what they say now
Long distance California let me call J Brown

Hear the story of a cappa, who was first described
Do one for money Sauce keep thirst alive
Like the shit filled with fam when I invent that hit
Like to scream Roc-a-fella when and represent that shit

Just some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things you like to do
With a wooden chair a dolo or with your crew
Just some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things you like to do
With a wooden chair a dolo or with your crew
What it is, is what is, is this is, what we do?

I like to get my hustle on and make loot all day
Spit game at these chicks smoke in the hallway
Know how I feel about you right next to F
Like to shop Tom D stay fresh to def

I like to analyze jigga, man the evils is deep
Late night I hit these hoes, while their peoples asleep
I like to wake up in the afternoon religiously
I on a vow last night fuck school, I'm a spend this G

I like to tell fake thugs, man they soft as nerves
Like they drink in front of the heat and take off the skirt
Like when chicks try to make it seam to provoke me the hitter
Handle that diplomatic and try to fuck their sister

Like to stay away from hoe, I heard caught a disease
Like to do shows then hit bums of some cheese
Everything I spit blaze now, us in this week
Now, I like to grab my dick and say bitch "I'm Memphis Bleek"

Just some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things you like to do
With a wooden chair a dolo or with your crew
Just some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things you like to do
With a wooden chair a dolo or with your crew
What it is, is what is, is this is, what we do?

I like to ride shotgun, roll my dro' in the coop
Like to go gold with you and hold my guns on the stoop
Like to shoot whack rappers and get away with the crime
Like to bag shorties tried to fuck me two at a time

Like to see that bitch nigga who alarming the cops
Only reason, I pull heat in front of his mom and pops
(I neva liked that)
But if he want to front on me I'm a strike back
Niggas can neva front on bleek

I like to bows fow niggas never snuck in my click
Everybody that is related we busting they shit
Any girl I want, believe Bleek fucking them quick
I like to watch the knicks while girls sucking my dick

No sweat, I like to do sets while watching the Nets
Go to parties take my shirt off and I'm rocking my vest
I like to come through and drink Bacardi Dark in the lex
After that, Smoke weed in the park when it's wet

I like to throw henium for all my niggas who died
All my street niggas who used to rock their timbs untied
Sauce Money, Memphis Bleek what we bound to do
Forever and a day we'd like to put this down for you

I'm Sayin, that everybody like to do something ya know
You like what you like, I like what I like
Thats what we doing what we like to do
Sauce money, Memphis Bleek
