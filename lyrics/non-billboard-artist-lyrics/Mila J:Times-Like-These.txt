Times-Like-These:Mila J
[Verse 1]
Let me take a minute to explain to you
All this time you've been in my corner like a trainer
Now you down, think it's time that I return the favour
As long as we got each other, what's there to be afraid of?

[Pre-Hook]
Cause I'ma ride witcha no matter what
And if the car ran out of gas break out the chucks
The we can walk it out, walk it out
Real bitches know what I talk' about

[Hook 1]
And I will never leave you, in times like these
Is when you need most love, in times like these
And I will be your shoulder, in times like these
Know I do what I gotta do, in times like these
Times like these, in times like these
When you need the most in times like these
I will be your shoulder, in times like these
In times like these, in times like these

[Verse 2]
When I say what I tell ya, you know I really mean it
Nothin' or nobody ever gonna come between
Yeah, cause you're my nigga
Finger on the trigger
And if some shit's about to go down
Know I'm goin' out witcha

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook 2]
And I will never leave you, in times like these
Is when you need most love, in times like these
I will be your shoulder, in times like these
I'll do what I gotta do, in times like these
In times like these, in times like these
When you need the most love, in times like these
Like Kobe and Vanessa in times like these
I wonder what I gotta do, in times like these
In times like these

[Break] (x2)
Said I'm in it for the long haul
If you fall, I fall, then we both fall
But if you ball, I ball, then we both ball

[Hook 1]
