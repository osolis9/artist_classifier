Jason-Mask:Bukshot
I dont think they realize what they fuckin with
Cause if they did they would know they name is on my bucket list
Before you know got your picture on a jug of milk
Its what you get for not respectin that Im slugger built
Knock ya head I might just let some lead off
Im callin bets off my choppas bout to set off
Im blinkin red
For talkin shit thats what they get
I see the future even Nostradamus probably did
Shoulda figured
I guess they got warnin late
Sippin liquor
Tryin to stop the mornin shakes
Somethin bigger
Im evil and Im pourin hate
Im a killa
Fuck they mom Im Norman Bates
Got my Jason mask on
My Freddy Krueger gloves
Leatherface's chainsaw
Blood on my Chucks
Michael Myers music turned way up
Pinheads attitude
I dont give a fuck
Got my Jason mask on
My Freddy Krueger gloves
Leatherface's chainsaw
Blood on my Chucks
Michael Myers music turned way up
Pinheads attitude
I dont give a fuck
They said I wasnt good enough to rock a fucking beat
They said I wasnt hood enough to claim Im from the streets
They said I dont know music cause Im bangin ICP
But if they knew I was thinkin
They'd be fraid of me
Im unstable and Im mentally unfit to live
Before I leave this world
I brought a little gift to give
Been a Weirdo ever since i was a little kid
Now that Im a grown up
Haters gonna give in
I Kill (With a drop of a dime on the block)
I Spill (with the brains i look at the thought)
I will (Let them hang and I hope that they rot)
Im Real (with this thing cause its all that I got)
Ill chop these people up in pieces just to start a war
And stuff their bodies in my freezer
Im a carnivore
Got my Jason mask on
My Freddy Krueger gloves
Leatherface's chainsaw
Blood on my Chucks
Michael Myers music turned way up
Pinheads attitude
I dont give a fuck
Got my Jason mask on
My Freddy Krueger gloves
Leatherface's chainsaw
Blood on my Chucks
Michael Myers music turned way up
Pinheads attitude
I dont give a fuck
I butcher faces like a horror flick
Rappers cannot stomach me
No they cannot handle this
Hungry for the money and blood
I call it ravenous
Im like a virus to the world
and its inhabitants
Im like a sickness
I just wanna stab a bitch
Take a trip to Canada
Find the perfect candidate
Shoot her in the knees
To hear her cry
She wont stand for this
My sense of humor might be tasteless but you'll laugh at this
(Sounds like fun)
I think I just might take a crack at this
(cuttin everyone)
Ill swing a weapon
I like wackin shit
(my hatchet weighs a ton)
Losin minutes like a laxative
(bitch you better run)
I like to share I got an ax to give
Got my Jason mask on
My Freddy Krueger gloves
Leatherface's chainsaw
Blood on my Chucks
Michael Myers music turned way up
Pinheads attitude
I dont give a fuck
Got my Jason mask on
My Freddy Krueger gloves
Leatherface's chainsaw
Blood on my Chucks
Michael Myers music turned way up
Pinheads attitude
I dont give a fuck
