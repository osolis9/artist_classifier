The-N-Word:Donald Glover 
All she needed was some.
All she needed was some.

At a Clipper's game on the court-side
Watch a nigga' shoot like a 45
They mad at me too I got more fire
When these girls see you go home Roger
Tia and Tamara in my bed I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you nigga's like apartheid
Hits on my list check my archive
I'm something so immaculate
Instead of asking what's happenin' rather blastin'
Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker
Than a Bernie Mac, some Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought here, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playin' Playstation
Why you standin' there, say som', girl say som'
No, this ain't a vacation
This is my house, my house

All she needed was some
All she needed was some

Bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna take shots? Ak, nigga
When I ball, I'm-a ball King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you want to play pool in my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a m√©nage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I-I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I-I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors...

All she needed was some
All she needed was some
