Dear-Maiden:Poetic Death
"I guess what interest me a lot is the relation two people could have with each other, and how badly that can get messed up sometimes when other things get involved"

I Want the best for you and I but/
To tell the truth/
It's been a nice amount of time/
And I'm still feeling it from our breakup/
Let's be honest/
I keep a handful of these memories/
In a clutch up in my pocket/
I tried my best/
But I couldn't stop it/
What's the purpose/
And I'm sitting here/
Asking where we went wrong/
You didn't have to be my girl/
But I lost a friend/
Was forced to move along/
And they're telling me/
To give it time/
Cause in life that heals everything/
But tomorrow isn't promised/
So why are you wasting time on the finer things/
I'm a martyr to your pendulum swing/
And just last week I heard the devastating thunder/
My homegirl had lost her little brother/
To the gloomy world we're living in/
And we're dying by the second/
Plus this life can be a lonely road/
I hope you're counting all your blessings/
The Wolf's Maiden/
Fades away and/
I'm DARCIA to your memories/
And until the day I die/
I want you to know/
That you mean the world to me/
And I mean that/
Still/
But a part of me says walk away/
Like fuck a Rose/
You'd ignore anyway/
But I see better days/

I see better days/
Don't let it fade away/

Don't let it fade away/
That's all I'm asking/
I know you've had a lot of your friends/
Walking out of your life in the past/
But I ain't them/
And I remain true/
That crash collision the other day/
Should be a reminder/
Of how quickly life could end for you/
Shit is too real/
I just want to rebuild/
Before our time's up/
And maybe with a little luck/
We could reconnect the pieces/
The other night you said some things/
But I'll keep it to myself/
Just watch your back with who you're living with/
Leave the alcohol on the shelf/
And I'll check that motherfucka'/
Anytime I seem him/
The whole world is looking at your smile/
But me/
I see beneath them/
The other night I had a nightmare/
And it's funny when I think of it/
Cause the first thing that I thought about/
Was your happiness and your well being/
These energies/
Then blend between us/
Don't even conversate/
And we're living up in the same space/
So what the fuck's with all the space/
Still/
But a part of me says walk away/
Like fuck a Rose/
You'd ignore me anyway/
But I see better days/
