Weekend-Thing-Featuring-B-Of-Midwikid-:Koffee Brown
Check, 1 2, yo', you're tuned in to Koffee Brown
This time we takin' it to the clubs, uh-oh, that's right
First it was Naughty, then it was Next, now it's CB
What, uh, come on

It's Friday, weekday, leavin' work early
Hop in the whip with the flip, get my girl
It's hair shop, facial, nails filled, toes done
â€~Cause it's on at the club

It's Saturday, don't stop, just left the barber shop
Fresh fade, geared up, just got my car washed
Music up, windows down, rims on, bling-bling
It's a weekend thing

Workin' on stress, hopped in the jeep yes
Light up, take two to the chest
Tired of the wheels, tripped out bosses
Talkin' threats, but I could care less

I just wanna let my hair done
Puff-puff, I think I'm there now

It's Friday, weekday, leavin' work early
Hop in the whip with the flip, get my girl
It's hair shop, facial, nails filled, toes done
â€~Cause it's on at the club

Saturday, don't stop, just left the barber shop
Fresh fade, geared up, just got my car washed
Music up, windows down, rims on, bling-bling
It's a weekend thing

Cash with the whip, cash card for the chips
Lick o' the sip, roll up on the dips
What it is, what it is
A won't you come by the crib

â€~Cause I just wanna have relations
Head to toe, girl, you're so-so amazing, you

It's Friday, weekday, leavin' work early
Hop in the whip with the flip, get my girl
It's hair shop, facial, nails filled, toes done
â€~Cause it's on at the club

Saturday, don't stop, just left the barber shop
Fresh fade, geared up, just got my car washed
Music up, windows down, rims on, bling-bling
It's a weekend thing

It's party time, pull up the Hummer top
Top down, feel the sunshine it's all right
Cork poppin' time go off into your ride
â€~Cause it's on tonight it's weekend

My end of the week commences by rippin' out the 20 inches
SOS for the road, Gerbraud's creased to the floor
No mo' sweets to flow on the sto' like a dro
And I know you got them switches, give me mo' of them to go

Seated in the barber shop, press playin' with it tapered in
Paper thin mustache trimmed and my weekend begin
Gimme plenty of Remy with a double shot of Henney
No taste, look at my face, I'm feelin' as good as any
It's the weekend

It's Friday, weekday, leavin' work early
Hop in the whip with the flip, get my girl
It's hair shop, facial, nails filled, toes done
â€~Cause it's on at the club

Saturday, don't stop, just left the barber shop
Fresh fade, geared up, just got my car washed
Music up, windows down, rims on, bling-bling
