Janky:E-Dubble
I let the beat go
Two tonnes I let the beat get took
Get took. Bone crusher
Mother fucker, never shook
Bet a hundred on myself just to see if I'm good
I'm good. Ch... ch.Charm City in the house though
Freestyle Friday with them outro's
Went to Philly, caught my breath, now I'm back though
Black Paisley in the house with that house though
I ain't even playing. Once upon a time
All I even really wanted was a chance to kick a rhyme
Now I'm kinda doing numbers and they seem to keep on climbing
They... they... they... they seem to keep on climbing
Back with that 808. When they see me it's hater rate
I don't give a fuck I'm killing these beats with a flow
Back with that paper weight. They ain't built for what's made today
I am fucking up the scene and they are loving the shock

They don't see the same shit I do
Well that cool I don't see the same shit they see
If we did that'd be kinda shitty anyhow
But for fun Vini Vici's got an A.P

I ain't even playing. Black Paisley in the house
Charm City in the house

I Black-Paisley'd this whole shit
Seal Team 6. On my sniper I spit
You can join the party. You can... you can join the clic
Band wagon's kinda full but we're going to get a hit
So sick with the old, and the new shit focused
Hear me everywhere like a mother fucking locust
Pushing forward. We have horsed-slow-poke and
Play me COD. No I be no chocking
Black Paisley on the wall though
The real life Where's Waldo
I maybe tall. I maybe ball. I may be hard nosed
I be out there busting like my mother-fucking car broke
So chop it up like a drum loop
They regret. We forget. We hit undo
I'm just getting warmed up. This a run through
Done playing hoops. Ain't shit I'm going to jump through
Onomatopoeia got em [???]
Play A. We work
No breaks; No cast; No crutch;
No feelings; No ceiling when they see me in the cut

I ain't even playing. Black Paisley in the house
Charm City in the house
