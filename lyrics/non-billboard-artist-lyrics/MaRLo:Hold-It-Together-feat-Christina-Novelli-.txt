Hold-It-Together-feat-Christina-Novelli-:MaRLo
Is it the feel of the unknown
Our fear of losing our control
This heart beats out when
Everything that we try
In time our eyes are open wide

Hold it together now
In the dark you wait for me
Will it be forever now
And my star will set you free

[?] is it over
Before it has begun
Hold it together now
And my star will set you free (my star will set you free)

Hold it together now

Hold it together now
In the dark you wait for me
Will it be forever now
And my star will set you free

[?] is it over
Before it has begun
Hold it together now
And my star will set you free (my star will set you free)
