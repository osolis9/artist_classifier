Times-Like-These:AJ
oh it's times like these
under the covers
where i feel complete
with you by my side
i finally get some sleep
it's times like these
in California
sitting on my beach
with you by my side
i hear your heartbeat
and it's times like
ohhhh hey
it's beautiful
ohhhh hey
it's magical
ohhhh hey
it's times like these
it's times like these
they turn my heart again to happiness
with you next to me
i have no worries
it's times like these
watching the fireworks
i kiss your lips
when you're next to meee
our favorite song on...
and it's times like
ohhhh hey
it's beautiful
ohhhh hey
it's magical
ohhhh hey
it's times like these
it's times like theeeeeese
hey

you are the soundtrack to my life
and it's times like

ohhhh hey
