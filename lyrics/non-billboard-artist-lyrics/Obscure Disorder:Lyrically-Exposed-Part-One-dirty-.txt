Lyrically-Exposed-Part-One-dirty-:Obscure Disorder
[logik]
Yeah yeah huh
Yeah yeah logik o.d. representative
Obscure disorder lyrically exposed
What?

Let me grab the tools and drop jewels like a knocked out gold tooth
Never theoretics i'm spitting out proof
Of obscure clicks coming through all of these masses
Bouncing off the air waves call me radioactive
My actions penetrate minds like psychotherapists
I freak my syllables, then i'm psycho the rapist
Take this because i strip your memory banks like amnesia
I make this shit go off, call me milk of magnesia
I stand like the mic and remain on the scene
I bust like masturbation, dehydrate all your wet dreams
Of freaking the funk, and any of your bs thought
Like a mini-series, i sent that ass back into parts (and hearts)
Mcs are getting shattered like lenses
Your ends is spent, decode the benz
Now duke where your friends at
Black you caught up like ll is getting hot
Fuck the player status, you keep falling like mug shot

Chorus
"lyrically i'm supposed to represent"
