Filling-Spaces:Scarub
Yo
What's up
Welcome to the new
Come check out
What i've got in store for you
But you know what
I'm kind of hungry come
come walk with me
And I and I tell you
What i been up to look

(Chorus 2x: Scarub)
I'm filling space
Reflecting on whats new
And how it use to be
Some say around my way
That i've been gone to long
But I rather have you
Feneing then be use to me
I see ya when I see ya
But until

(Scarub):
It's like we be living
The modern daily life
Melodramatic episode
Etitled lively hood
Where were all characters
Intertwined protagomist
And politicians
All thrown into the same pot
Overcrowded and when shit gets hot
Whose ever richer
Got the law on their side
And police in their pockets
Busting out with billy clubs
Trigger happy militants
Just love to push and shove
With their badges at the club
It's too packed
If the crowd is too black
If they pull you to the side
And ideas is what you lack
They patrol for them back
Forcing you how to act
Telling us to simmer down
Say they got places for clowns
And if your skin is brown
Then we'll return you to the ground
But me I'm heavenbound
Mister incarheto went through your town
I stay astray probably found
Come take a walk
With me down these inter city blocks
I got a slow stroll but my mind is quick
Predicting actions before they happen
Attacking life like rapping
But when babloyn also happend
I don't know shit
I've been reasoning with people
On this planet acting evil
When I see them it's a sequal
Or the same Seleloke
Some say they got a plan
But leave the money from my pockets
My stomach is grumbling
And I wish they would stop it
Can't focus when I'm hungry
And my ears are hurting
So I keep dispersing
Under their breath
I hear them cursing
Probably should have
Checked them on it
But I'm a just keep walking
I need this sandwich
I haven't eaten all day
It's already 5 o'clock man
But yeah don't worry
It's a cool place a cool service
They don't speak english
But just tell them what you want

(Chorus: 2x)
Yeah, I usually order you know
But the delivery dude
He got kind of like
He got mugged like yesterday
Somewhere over here
So we gotta walk but we almost there

(Scarub)
What happens
When you find yourself
In a terrible predictament
When major decisions need to be made
That'll affect
The whole world around you
And finding help is like trying
To find a reliable source
There's a chance o whats the size
And does it work in your favor
And on whos scale
Just finding someone to confide
In becomes fustrating as hell
Like trying to find a cop
When you need one
Or better yet trying
To shake the cops
When you need to run
Nothing works in your favor
No matter your behavor
Social status or financial platters
Your able to afford
Even if I'm platium
Even if your fattening them pockets
Fresh skyrockets explode in the brain
The aftermath is hell
The cost to rebuild
Seems imposible to acquire
Your life is on the line of fire
Sucess is what you desire
Circumstances cause you to retire
Either can see no buyer
Tired someting
But we hold on to our feet
Right now I'm hungry
It's it's too much for stomach
Right now look we're almost there
It's about three more blocks
After we make this left
And cross the street over here
On what is it

(Chorus)

(Scarub)
The mind mud wrestles
A combination of dirty thoughts
And wet instincts
I tried to talk to the girl
Who said if dirt were dollars
Then i would be a rich man
I had to stop and think
And said if dirt were dollars
Then the men on top
Would be even richer from the dirt
That they drew in the land that they own
Filthy rich while we still inched in
some kind of financial calomine lotion
A potion while they pan around
like they going through the same
Amount of motions
As we do you see that
Let me help you sandwiches
As you ain't can see
We be devouring the wheat bread
While all they eat is the flour
You try to catch up to the lettuce
Thinking they inbelished you
But they still deny you relish
That shit is still pickles
They just gone like grey poupon
Acting all stingey with the mayo
When the salt and vinegar
You added the cold cuts then cheese
No matter if you are
American, parmesan or comoloan
They only stick to they own
But front like it's olive
The mess make me as hot as a jalopina
Making me wanna get all up in ya face
Acting like they taste better
But I don't get bitter
I barbaque my own method
For filling my platter on any ocassion
Stimulating my sensation
To eat while thinkin my options
Is anoyative improvis coming fresher
With the side order of fries
And maybe some brown rice sounds
Kind of good right now you know
Yeah maybe
Some kind of new naw soplantos
Or I dont know something
We bout to find something
I'm hungry as hell
It's right here
Rright here, right here

(Chorus)
