Jus-So-Ya-No:CPO
Talk to them CPO

Permit me to kick some licks, a bodacious flow
Occupation, looney motherfucker; set I claim, The Row
So the first motherfucker that's caught up in the twist
Will be found in the depths of the Westbound

Take your place while we here to lay raws
Drizzaws, full of caper for some paper to fold
Sort of a jack episode if you will
I was a do-low nigga from birth and I'm that do-low nigga still

See that, be what, the fuck a nigga mean
When I say, you can't envision me, cause I can't be seen
Like Casper the Ghost I creeps the most
'Cause I'm just so motherfuckin' sly, invisible through the eye

So motherfuckers can duck and dodge and slide
But there's, really no escape from the nigga from this side
Which side? Westside, layin' in the cut to gank your load
When we's in don't give a fuck mode

See if it's grip we want, it's grip we get
So run motherfuckers 'fore you're caught up in the sunsets
Bitch-made niggaz best to keep that ass at home
'Cause that Boss Hog nigga's on the late night roam

This is just so ya know [unverified] niggaz to hoes
If an ass gets gone, well, it's good as on
(It's on)
If you're trickin' off your luck you're dead as a duck
And till the day we gives a fuck, 'cuz, you're wrong

This is just so ya know [unverified] niggaz to hoes
If an ass gets gone, well, it's good as on
(It's on)
If you're trickin' off your luck you're dead as a duck
And till the day we gives a fuck, 'cuz, you're wrong

The late night, creeper nigga gets his stroll
For seekin' out that bitch, to open the guts and bust on my nuts
Off to the spizznot with chronic and fat knots
And them murderizin' hoes droppin' drawers to expose cock

Now I'm [unverified] emotions of a G
Girl, you know this Death Row, so you can not see a nigga
That's fin' to get paid on they block, think I ain't?
'Cause I've been known to bank and serve up glock fool

Now on the move, to much higher and bigger thangs
Must be in it to win it, 'cause I does them nigga thangs
My nuts is where they wanna swang, and dangle off and on they roam
And no romance between us so gets the fuck on

Bitch-made, nut and break his nose, and meaner for tricks
I gots love for nothin but my niggaz and grip
So now you know and I be's off into the moonlight
Puffin' the I-N-do

This is just so ya know [unverified] niggaz to hoes
If an ass gets gone, well, it's good as on
(It's on)
If you're trickin' off your luck you're dead as a duck
And till the day we gives a fuck, 'cuz, you're wrong

[Unverified] we, get into the grillin' of a, fool
Ain't no nigga breathin' can fuck up my rule
I'm that same nigga police done sought
But no a nigga never ever been caught, 'cause I'm just sneaky doe

I'm [unverified] and stinky, for those who see me
I rolls discretely, does my lows discretely
Completely, a true blue G to my name
CPO the shit and Death Row's to blame

So if a nigga wanna breathe in long
then the nigga best to eat his own
That's how me and Nina does
We gives a fuck who nigga what

If he's steppin' to me wrong, nigga gone
Bitch so late [unverified] it ain't shit
Kinda like that 'llac bendin' corners, I ain't easy to hit
The hoe as in G'dee don't wanna see, right

Peeps through the sight, them freaks as they peeps the late night
Freeze up, raise up, cause Jack it's on for your [unverified]
If you're [unverified] motherfucker break yo' self
'Cause yo' fo' is kinda sweet

I think I'ma have transfer them Dana's to my Grand Cherokee
Be slippin' niggaz up out of they shit like surgery
'Cause a motherfucker gots to get stacked on track with urgency
Ya know, so next time slang motherfuckin' thangs
Your shit'll be gone, fuck if you see me if I see you it's on

This is just so ya know [unverified] niggaz to hoes
If an ass gets gone, well, it's good as on
(It's on)
If you're trickin' off your luck you're dead as a duck
And till the day we gives a fuck, 'cuz, you're wrong
