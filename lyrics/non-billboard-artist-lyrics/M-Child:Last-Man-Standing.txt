Last Man Standing
Chorus (4x): You don't know me 
My weapon's here to tell ya 

[Lord Infamous] 
Torture til they gone never stay alone killas laser chrome 
Hunting in the zone where the enemies roam 
Massacre the town fire all yo rounds make em all fall down 
Please don't make a sound hear the Devil growl 
Please don't go to sleep never go to sleep 
You may not awake cause I'm goin to take you deep down beneath 
The Scarecrow's in the woods, creeping through the woods 
Creeping through yo hood, please don't be so scared 
Go and take a look 
I got behind the steel, may I be forgived, I didn't mean to kill 
Now I wipe your bone and blood off my windshield 
I'm sitting in the park, fire on the lost, watching body parts 
Burning into sparks, bloodied on my saw 
Lord Infamous is me, psychpathically, driven in the mind 
Seek and you shall find my evil is blind 
Cause I give a fuck less, color of your flesh, I just want to mess 
Up your fuckin chest with my jet black tech 

Chorus 4x 

[Gangsta Boo] 
Playa what you know about the south side? 
Not a damn thing, but yo ass do not realize 
South is takin over, nigga, squashin all this bullshit 
North, east, west, it's all good, gotta represent 
Comin with the quickness, oh my goodness, it's this gangsta bitch 
Never solo only roll with niggaz down with Triple 6 
What you gettin jealous fo? 
Nigga you don't know me so 
Bustin so Mafia World, Mafia makin money ho 

[Juicy J] 
Yeah, this Triple 6 Mafia click it's real 
Fool it ain't nothin fake 
We tote them glocks and keep them cocked and never hesitate 
You wanna run up to this click and talk that ?flodge? and shit 
And have yo ass tied up and thrown away off in a ditch 
Or see me bitch, drop to yo feet while you flow 20 deep 
Deep in the Mississippi River wrapped up in a sheet 
And then ya know the Last Man Standin can't be you or me 
How could fuck with this and my fuckin N-i-n-e? 
BEEYATCH! 

Chorus 4x 

[D.J. Paul] 
The Last Man Standin'll never be part of the B.O.N.E 
Comin from that ? 4-0, searchin for my enem-eny 
Niggaz tryin to come quick, shut it up you fixin to die trick 
40 caliber, gonna rowdy ya to the brains, you fixin to die, bitch 
Huh, in the Mid-south we cannot see ya, may never wanna be ya 
When you come up out that Chevy with yo draws off 
Sawed-offs we be aimin, never with yo games-es 
Automatic my brains is, shootin yo fuckin brains in

Wanna after party ain't no stoppin us 
Comin from the M, ain't no love for her or him

Man I doubt ya even last in the past 
You thought you had some characters, fuckin the wrong click

Bitches alive after the rest of demands 
The Three 6 Mafia, the last to stand

Chorus 4x 

[Gangsta Blac] 
Deuce, deuce down, drinkin crown with the Texas thugs 
Scrugs, ain't no love, catch me slummed of them fuckin drugs

[M-Child] 
It's almost nightfall, let me slip on my murderer mugs 
A smile to a frown make a nigga think that I'm on drugs 
Orange Mound where I be, Mackin Child is who I be 
A young to arrested got you stressin to my mystery 
Psycho kids split yo wig, all over the mighty dollar 
Fuckin with my Devil this ho let this beam up out yo collar 
Comin deep, Mafia deep, puttin you niggaz to fuckin sleep 
A bomb in yo pager, now watch it blow when the Child beep
