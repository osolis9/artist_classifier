Brooklyn-Pride:Lordz of Brooklyn
[Verse One: performed by ADMoney]
Cause I'm cruisin' down the ave system thumpin'
Brooklyn buddah batch yo is what I'm tokin'
I take a lot of pride in that Brooklyn shit
I didn't make it up I was born with it
I got the Saturday night fever
The bars and pizzerias
The tinted up windows cuisettes with their feet up
Drive to the bridge take it for a climb
I'm on top of the world lookin' down with Brooklyn pride

[Chorus]
Hey Goombaa, where you at
Yo I'm cruisin' down the ave in my black cadillac
Hey Goombaa, where's it at
I got the Brooklyn pride that's where it's at

[Verse Two: performed by ADMoney]
I'm from Brooklyn baby respected by all
You can tell my freegin' style from the writin' on the wall
It's all about the kid in the tattoo parlor
Gets his name on his arm and a heart for his mama
Well it's the Lordz of Brooklyn and I sport it on my vest
I love a Brooklyn girl in a Catholic school dress
Never talk to a cop, drag down the block
I got my brother on my side check the style that he rocks

[performed by Kaves]
It's Kaves the crooner, I should have been here sooner
I'm live from Bensonhurst, livin' like The Honeymooners

[performed by ADMoney]
Never run never hide to the day that I die
I'm a Lord and I roll with that ol' Brooklyn pride

[Chorus]
