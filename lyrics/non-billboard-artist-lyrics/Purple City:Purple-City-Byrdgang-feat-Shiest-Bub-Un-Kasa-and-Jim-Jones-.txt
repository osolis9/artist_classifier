Shiest Bub:
Yo it's Shiest Bub, yeah you know I'm a veteran
10th grade I was a Varsity letterman
Introduced to crack, now we headed to Maryland
Fiends knockin' at the door, go ahead nigga let 'em in
Yeah we poppin', cop 4 keys when the cheddars in
Niggaz I ain't worryin', send shots an' they scurryin'
These actions we, hurried 'em, bastards we burried 'em
In the belly ofthe beast it's Shiest the Barbarian
Hook

Verse 2
Un Kasa:
Catch me O.T., Maybach wit' a bitch
Two Macs strapped to the lips now rapidly spit
Two bad Brazilian bitches wrappin' my spliffs
Two birds strapped to they hip
Purple seats lavender 6
100 thou just to wrap up the wrist
Nod your head, cash in your whip
Got the crack stash in the van
Yo them Macs I got 'em stashed in the trench
Empty two clips when I'm havin' a fit
Two guns I ain't havin' that shit
Diplomat, Purple City, better honor that shit
It's on my arm wit' that shit

For your moms, put a bomb in her whip
They be wonderin', where the car and her went
On some arsenal shit
Jim Jones is the Capo of this
You up next my nigga just let those cartridges spit
(Bddaaat Bddaaat Bddaaat Bddaaat Bddaaat)
Yeah nigga you know what's gonna happen
When I pull up and pull out all your gonna hear is "Word to the 5"
Hook
Verse 3
