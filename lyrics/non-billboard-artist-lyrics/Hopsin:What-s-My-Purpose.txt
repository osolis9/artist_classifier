What-s-My-Purpose:Hopsin
Planet Earth
The place that I live
We live
Who owns it?
You?
Nah... nobody owns this shit
Just a big ass piece of rock with humans on it
Do what the fuck I wanna do

A lost human born into a dark society
With what mind state?
There's no variety
Moving vibrantly
Trying to be the best that I can be
I've tried to see the light in living life but it just blinded me—irony
Now I'm thinking violently
Because I feel my country went and lied to me
It's bringing out a whole new fucking side to me
Ride with me
If you feel my pain then you can cry wit me
This fuckin' shady system is the rivalry
They the ones who raised us
Turned us into cage nuts
They're what we're afraid of
They are why we ain't us
They the reason we constantly livin' for money and we just can't budge
It's taking a toll on your dreams, so you gave up
And now the pain stuck
They ain't showin' nothin' but fake love
We just numbers put on a pay stub
Our purpose shouldn't be to make bucks
We all slaves and if we ever make a change then we straight fucked

I can't stand humans, I hate humans
But I'm a human (I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it
Humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me, you fucking human
The problem is killing my mind
God give me sign, maybe I'm tripping
Tell me this life is worth living

Who set the standard for everybody to live by?
How far along in life would you be if you did try?
Who's trying to help these ghetto neighborhoods where kids die?
This world has turned into a mother fucking pigsty
I look outside and it disgusts me
It bugs me, it's ugly
I trust no other fucking human but me
So what needs to be done?
Every day is a rerun
Technology is advanced
As people, how far have we come?
Yeah, I can see the time's grown
But still, I'm mind blown
Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside their iPhone
They always texting and posting statuses hourly
But in reality, there's no sign of a personality
It's cowardly
We should live life, we scared to get some -ologies
The human being is what we don't know how to be
And honestly
These issues really suck to know
But I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow
So God, show me where the fuck to go!

I can't stand humans, I hate humans
But I'm a human (I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it
Humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me, you fucking human
The problem is killing my mind
God give me sign, maybe I'm tripping
Tell me this life is worth living

How can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?
These rappers blowing up, but through my eyes they not as real to me
They constantly conceal the beast but never try to heal the streets
Teaching girls to be a slut, but never make them feel unique
How can we feel fine this way?
Open up your minds today
The matrix got you young – Owing a debt you'll spend your life to pay
Stressed out
Assuming that you'll be more happier inside your brain
Don't tell me you don't got no fucking struggle, nigga cause I know pain
To the point where I felt like life was shit
Growing up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with
Should've just stuck with repeating
The world is tough to be in
Munching on fast food
Don't even know what the fuck I'm eating
America, I gave it my all
Still you guys arrested me for being black and standing on a sidewalk
It doesn't matter if I'm breaking laws or being harmless
I'm automatically hated by cops cause my dark skin
God was my smartest option
My soul is mine, ya'll ain't gonna bargain off it
Cause if you do that means the darkness profits
The sky is where I got my heart adopted
Man, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this
But ya'll assume that I'm just startin' nonsense
But I promise ya'll the fucking world is gonna remember Marcus Hopson!
There's consequences for enlightenment
But if I have to hide the truth to live then I'mma die just like my idols did

I can't stand humans, I hate humans
But I'm a human (I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it
Humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me, you fucking human
The problem is killing my mind
God give me sign, maybe I'm tripping
Tell me this life is worth living
