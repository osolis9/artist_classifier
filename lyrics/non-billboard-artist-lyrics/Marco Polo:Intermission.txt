Intermission:Marco Polo
"Alright everyone, my name is Michael Rapaport, the original Zebra Head. You might remember me from 'Higher Learning.' I shut down the show as Remy. Bam! Before we get into the second half of this album, we’re gonna have a brief intermission for those who want to stretch their legs, go get drinks, go get smoke, go to the bathroom, drain the monster. Do whatever you need to do. Go take a break, get your head right. Coming back with more bangers. Real bangers. Big bank bangers."

"The total run time for this program is approximately eighty minutes, so for those that had issue with the run time of 'PA1' being too long—this is art. Alright? This wasn’t made for the critics, this was made for the heads, the hip hop heads, the aficionados, the ones who appreciate the boom bap, the boogie bang. Anyone who doesn’t like it: now’s the perfect chance to leave. Vamoose. You’re wack to me. Bounce. Break out. See ya. Beat it. Scram. Skidaddle. Get the fuck out of here."

"So far the show’s got everything. Action, drama, sex, violence—you name it, we got it. Got some social commentary in there, got a love story, even got a bionic MC. Not the 'Six Million Dollar Man.' A bionic MC. Marco definitely went all out with this one. Appreciate it, love it, listen to it, rewind it, press the other button."

"Okay, I think everyone’s back, everyone’s ready. Everyone that matters, that is. Hopefully you stick around for the end of the show. We got a nice little tribute to one of our fallen comrades—definitely a special moment."

"Lastly, in case of a fire, please be aware of emergency exits. Got sprinklers, we got all kinds of things. Pay attention, be safe, relax, settle in, turn the volume up just a little bit more than normal."

"Again, my name is Michael Rapaport. Thank you for sticking around. We now continue with Marco Polo’s 'PA2: The Director’s Cut.' The long version. The official, official version. Enjoy the rest of the show. Let’s go!"
