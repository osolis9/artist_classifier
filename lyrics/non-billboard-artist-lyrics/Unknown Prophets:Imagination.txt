Imagination:Unknown Prophets
Everything's looking lovely
I see nothing but blue skies above me
There's no critics trying to clown me or judge me
And they can push all they want, but they can't budge me
You see I'm coming from a solid foundation
We make beautiful sounds down in the basement
It's underground hip hop on your station
We're trying to be in constant rotation
I'm in a place where there's no crime or gangsters
We're all friends so there's no sign of strangers
There's no storms or forces of nature
There's no disease, no death or no danger
And nobody's obese or overweight here
We eat what ever we want and still look great here
There's no need for exercise or counting calories
Plus the branches on the trees are filled with candy leaves
I'm kinda like Willie Wonka in my fairy tale
Cause all you smell is vanilla, chocolate and caramel
I ride to work on the back of a blueberry snail
And when you ask me how I am, it's always very well
See everybody wears a smile and all the kids are happy
And even though we're all different we're like the biggest family
When I dream I think of places just like this
Man, to have an imagination is priceless

We are all God's creations
And we are blessed with imagination
Sometimes you gotta let your mind be free
Fly in the sky or climb a tree
You'll be surprised what's inside of me and my imagination

I found a place that's beyond belief
No sadness, pain, agony or grief
A place where love and happiness is never brief
No stress, we can all relax on the beach
At last we can all feast and raise a glass
No longer divided by race or class
Every cry's been replaced with a smile and laugh
Bills are paid and we still have a pile of cash
Peace on every street, never any conflict
Politicians that do what they promised
At nights you see the stars and the comets
Lay back to the sounds of the prophets
Just leave your car unlocked and parked in the driveway
In this place there's no roads or no highways
You can say that we travel through the sky ways
Cause we just close our eyes and we fly away
Everything we say is like pure poetry
Every word right where it's supposed to be
No worries for my friends or my family
Cause God's watching over those that are close to me
There's no need for horoscopes or any psychics
Choose your own destiny in this life, kid
when I dream, I think of places just like this
Man, to have an imagination is priceless

We are all God's creations
And we are blessed with imagination
Sometimes you gotta let your mind be free
Fly in the sky or climb a tree
You'll be surprised what's inside of me and my imagination
