Come-to-My-Rescue:Hush
Down, down, deeper and down
her young heart falls to the ground
why, why, whispering why
does the choir boy sing
- does the choir boy sing

And she cries all night
come to my rescue
but he's out of her life

It cuts like a knife
there's nowhere to hide
she's losing the fight
she runs from the pain
a wound will remain
and follow her through

Time, time, healing time
will you come and ease her mind
shame, shame, who is to blame
for the state she's in
- for the state she's in

And she cries all night
come to my rescue
but he's out of her life

It cuts like a knife
there's nowhere to hide
she's losing the fight
she runs from the pain
a wound will remain
and follow her through

Will follow her through
she's hurting for you
how could you use
a young heart so true

Refr√£o

Down, down, deeper and down
her young heart falls to the ground
