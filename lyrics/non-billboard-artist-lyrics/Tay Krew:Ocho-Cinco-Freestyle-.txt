Verse 1

Let it be known For them niggas who not
I'm going in give it all that I got
All cash down to pull off the lot
autograph signed and end with a dot like
Whoopp 3x
Real niggas don't get re-po'ed 
Put the money in the clip
if she want it then she strip
Cause i would never let another chick free load
It took me being orphan
To find out whats most Important
I spent most my life with camera angles constantly recording
So I pull up all quick on the side of yo chick
Tell her take a seat in the front of my whip
Then I push in the clutch and pull back the stick

then sccccuuuurrrr... that's the sound when i shift

Made for this life Can u say the same?
Born in the wild Wont ever be tame
Some thing inside that must entertain
So i will not be the weak link in the chain
Treat her like an instrumental
Wrap it up and I beat
Ya
How could u ever compete
Born in the suburbs then Raised in the street
Me and my group all in the coop
mean Mugging Niggas who licking my boot
With all they girls thinking I'm cute
the ones who mad are the ones outta the loop
Like nigga how the fuck u gone hate
See the rims on the whip think
A nigga gone skate
I done Swam from the bottom to the top of the lake
Writing rhymes i was winning
Call lines they where spinning My tape
I'm going in without no hook
With all of this time to my self that I took
Laws of Power lines in that book
made this shit as real as it look
Cause if I'm doubting my self I'm choosing to loose
oiled machine with the tightest of screws
Tactics developed that I've learned to use
made me an impossible force to refuse
Cause They try to match my impact
My niggas know that I been back
My niggas ride till my rims black
2x
Running from the city cause my city is a cage
I be going wild cause this life style pays
And I'm down to do whatever So this life style stays
I done put in more work then niggas twice my age
Bout time all this bull shit pays off
I done been at home but i never took a day off
Got a bad bitch to take my J's off
So when her bra Come off it stay off
Nigga I ball / Nigga that's all
Stacking My paper To see how it fall
I'm backin that ass up on the wall
We fight then we fuck So it ends in a draw
I mean that
My time got a limit When am I gonna win it
With the rims on the whip When I ride all tinted
En my CD done with the lines all printed
But the fans wanna know when am I gone send it
Cause It's been 9 months and I aint dropped no vid
niggas cant match what the fuck I did
But I had to dip I fell off that grid
so much cash in my jar I can't close my lid
Bass bumpin ain't nothin Driving throughout my city
Then u know Tay stunting
Paid it in advance
Niggas never had a chance
and I did it with out a 9 to 5 and that's something
