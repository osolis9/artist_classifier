Keep-It-Alive-Only-Jazz-Remix-:Kero One
(Verse 1)
I put the needle to the groove and let my physical move
to these deep funky rhythms that uplift my mood
flippin' through tunes and stacks of wax for quality
addicted to vinyl and my only cure is poverty
getting fingers dusty in a number of states
is the thrill the kill or hunt for chase
catch me diggin in crates for fatter breaks than Pangaea
making beats for streets creating a buzz like sangria
searching groove merchants and virgin soil for soul
unearthing those beats that make your body lose control
and it don't stop a story telling never ending
Cali? s the setting the plots a pot forever melting
connecting cultures, through music its amusing
disk jockeys rock parties and it's records they're using
awesome feeling my nodding head forecasts
its the beats, no the vibes, man I cant hold back
(chorus)
so yes yes party people are you feeling the vibes?
records are rotating and I'm feelin alright
we resurrect old artists and help their music survive
so join us on this ride to keeping vinyl alive
(repeat)
(verse2)
and now its Friday I just got paid
I'm off to vinyl shops cause hunger can wait
And I'll explore stores mining for that diamond in the rough
without music I'm handicapped and vinyl? s my crutch
lifting me up inverting my frown when I'm down
mentally I hear its melodies but yet to be found
so I lounge until that day we're bound by destiny
looking past the cover to see if its meant to be
cause if it's unique I'll discover what's underneath
to reveal its true appeal and if we're destined to meet
and check the rhythm, check the rhythm like this
and check the rhythm cause true love is in sync
as I flirt with wax in search of romance
honeymoon in my room and give birth to tracks
and perhaps happily after this chapter will end
is it the beats or the steez? damn I can't comprehend...
(chorus)
its like this yall, are you feeling the vibes?
records are rotating and I'm feelin alright
we resurrect old artists and help their music survive
so join us on this ride to keeping vinyl alive
(repeat)
