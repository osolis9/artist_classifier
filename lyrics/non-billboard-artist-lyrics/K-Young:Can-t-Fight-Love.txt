Can-t-Fight-Love:K-Young
Told myself, me and you we'll never be together
But what I never knew is the creator of the world saw us
Forever
Oooh, as a perfect fit so I don't give a damn how hard is get
Noooo
Everytime you come around, I fall in love again

Everytime you come around (yaay)
I lose the words to say, I wonder how you feel about me
(Oooh) Everytime tou come around, it feels so good
I didn't wanna fall in love, but I couldn't fight love

I probably look foolish, but I ain't ashamed
When you love, you lose the right side of your brain
And I'd give all this up, this fortune and fame
For you
Ooh baby, if your serious about this here
Wel that's the best thing I heard this year
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahh)
(Ahhh, ahhh)
Oh baby let's paint a picture that's crystal clear
Like the diamonds that in your ear
(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhhhhhh)

Everytime you come around (yaay)
I lose the words to say, I wonder how you feel about me
(Oooh) Everytime tou come around, it feels so good
I didn't wanna fall in love, but I couldn't fight love

Everytime you come around (yaay)
I lose the words to say, I wonder how you feel about me
(Oooh) Everytime tou come around, it feels so good
I didn't wanna fall in love, but I couldn't fight love

Oooooooooh, ooooooooooh
Oooooooooh Yaaaaaayaaaaa

I can't fight the feeling, I can't fight the love
I can't figh the urge to emerge my love
I love this feeling and I'm dreaming of better days
I love this feeling and I'm dreaming of better days

Everytime you come around (yaay)
