Nolia-Clap:Juvenile-Wacko-Skip 
Where dat Melph at? Where dat Yo at?
Where dat Thomas at? Where VL at?
Ya'll hear that nolia clap? Ya'll hear that nolia clap?

I'm in the Calio, You know I'm headed front of town
By Kayotic and Lil' real one, 'cuz it's goin' down
You see the DB's tell â€~em Wacko lookin' for â€~em
I got some dro, I got some change, I got some pussy for â€~em

If they ask you where I'm at I'm in the Melph pickin' up Chuck
In the chromed out bubblegum pickup truck
Slide on Josephine, holla at Lil Kia and pluck
My nigga Troy told me to keep it real as fuck

We bought the House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia
On Washington and Ferret, across the street from Babosca
But first I'm 'bout to snatch up all Saratoga
Head straight to foot action and snatch me two pair of Solja's

Take a left on Taladonna get a O of that doja
Tell â€~em right on my trail and hit the gars and let's roll up
I'm bout to hit Julio and get the blazes from soda
I got Geezy waitin' on VL we 'bout to bang up this Yola

Where dat Melph at? Where da Yo at?
Where dat Thomas at? Where VL at?
Ya'll hear that Nolia Clap? Ya'll hear that Nolia Clap?

Where Hollygrove at? Gert Town at?
P Town at? Nigga Town at? Bust it!
