You-re-With-the-Wrong-One:Fried
Didn't I love you?
Didn't I love you the best?
Didn't I love you?
Maybe better than the rest
Was it me?
Yeah
Was it me?

Now I find that all those pretty little things you used to say
Running through my mind
Someone tell me why I really didn't see just what I had
Wasted so much time

You're with the wrong one baby
Should've been with me
You're with the wrong one baby
Anyone can see

Am I crazy?
Am I the one you're thinking of?
Tell me maybe
Am I the one you never forgot?
You're not free, no
You're not free

Well it's true that I was waiting for a bus that never came
Gotta make this plane
Now I know I know, I
never really should've let you go
Must've been insane

You're with the wrong one baby
Baby baby
Should've been with me
You're with the wrong one baby
Oh anyone, anyone can see

Now I find that all those pretty little things you used to say
See it's running through my mind
Someone tell me why I really didn't see just what I had
Wasted so much time

You're with the wrong one baby
Should've been with me
You're with the wrong one baby
Anyone can see
Should've been with me baby

You're with the wrong one baby
Oh should've been
Should've been with me
You're with the wrong one baby
Anyone can see
