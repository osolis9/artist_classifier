When-I-Fall:Castle
22 years living in a dream
Given everything any child has ever seen
But now I'm on my own, don't know how to be alone
Lookin' like I'm lost, crossing lines I shouldn't cross
Because I'm scared, I'm so damn scared... finally!

So teach me how to be free!
Won't you help?
Don't make a fool out of me.
The grass don't look very green at all
So please be there, I'm gonna need a hand when I fall.

How will I know exactly who to keep?
The people that I've lost, I see them every time I sleep
Sayin' please don't go, there's still so much you need to know
There's nothing left to give, the way to learn is just to live
But I refuse to do a thing without you!

So teach me how to be free!
Won't you help?
Don't make a fool out of me.
The grass don't look very green at all
So please be there, I'm gonna need a hand when I fall.

Remember
Things are changing
For the better?
I'm not sure.
But you are for certain
that's why it's hurtin' me to say
Please just stay.

And teach me how to be free!
Won't you help?
Don't make a fool out of me.
The grass don't look very green at all
So please be there, I'm gonna need a hand when I fall.
