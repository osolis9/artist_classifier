Goodbye-Fool-World:Time
[** feat. Damon JeVon:]**


[Time:]
No need to think I dip the quill in the ink
Dear world followed by a comma
Indent the paragraph put a period after drama
Thank you for the food and the friends you have brought me
Thank you for the forgiveness and the lessons you have taught me
I'm on a journey, a saga to kill desire
And if I said I didn't have an ego, then id be a liar
But here we are staring face to face
I'm looking in the mirror, personal histories erased
I got an empty suitcase and it's filled with grace
My head's a fog so I dead the dialogue
I'm staring at the stars for the address of god

[Damon JeVon:]
I promise I won't leave a thing (leave a thing)
This life is like a crazy dream (crazy dream)
So goodnight to the world, goodbye to tomorrow
I gotta suitcase, full of all of my sorrow (goodbye fool world)
And I ain't leaving a thing (leaving a thing)
I got my third eye open, shoelaces tied
Standing in the light, I ain't got nothing to hide (goodbye fool world)
And I ain't leaving a thing

[Time:]
Goodbye fool world, I'm not coming back
No more reincarnation, guilt's a trap
And no I ain't killing myself it's deeper then that
And no I'm not getting shot from beef from rap
I'm leaving looking for that ocean of light
I'm one thought away I might even make it tonight
I was praying for an answer, or something to write
There he was off in the distance
Has it been 23 years or just an instant?
I gave him a hug, wiped off the tears and told em thanks
I wanna write a goodbye letter to the world but my papers blank, goodbye

[Damon JeVon:]
I promise I won't leave a thing (leave a thing)
This life is like a crazy dream (crazy dream)
So goodnight to the world, goodbye to tomorrow
I gotta suitcase, full of all of my sorrow (goodbye fool world)
And I ain't leaving a thing (leaving a thing)
I got my third eye open, shoelaces tied
Standing in the light, I ain't got nothing to hide (goodbye fool world)
And I ain't leaving a thing
