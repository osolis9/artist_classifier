Spiderman-on-Vitamins:Jesse Abraham
My mom named me Jesse
Hebrew for emcee
Majestic since birth
Quick as a jetski
I was home and ingesting
No milk, just words
What a fine blessing
To be raised so well
Rays of light even when I raised hell
Razor sharp was a phrase I knew well
My reign was inevitable never to fail
Then I got older by the age of one
"Crawlin!"
I was dangerous
Met a girl named rap, it became a crush
The resta world seemed lame to us
So lame to us, it's so lame to us
The whole entire planet was a game to just be played on so I stayed on my course
No chores, just bars, sharp darts and metaphors

Eyes open wide
But you can't see me
If I was your guide
Still can't see me
Might if you tried
No, you can't see me
Leave your mind petrified
You can't see me

Mom named me A-Bruh
Hammerhead shark
Jaws so sharp that I gnawed on bark at the doggon park and I crawled
on shards of glass so fast that I never got scarred
Never got taught, never got smart
Teachers tried to reach me but they never got far
In Hebrew school when I was eight my teacher tried to tell me that God
was everything
Raised my little hand said, "how can that be? God's not stupid and
God's not mean."
"God's flawless, perfect and great. He makes everything"
"Does he make mistakes?"
You can't teach me about god
That's not something I can learn from the outside
No doubt. Now what do I shout?
If it's not from within it's without

Eyes open wide
But you can't see me
If I was your guide
Still can't see me
Might if you tried
No, you can't see me
Leave your mind petrified
You can't see me

I invented clapping
I invented snapping
I invented
I invented kissing
I invented wishing
I invented
I invented lying
I invented dying
I invented
I invented freshness
I invented questions
I invented
I invented water
I invented slaughter
I invented
I invented walking
I invented talking
I invented
I invented melting
I invented helping
I invented language
I invented anguish
I invented smiles
I invented style
I invented frying pans and drying fans and buying plans
I'm spiderman on vitamins
I'm spiderman on vitamins
I'm spiderman on vitamins
I'm spiderman on vitamins

But you can't see me
Still can't see me
No, you can't see me
You can't see me

So my last name's Hartman
Man of the heart and
My plan from the start was to stand out apart from the bland and
depart from the land and the stars
I'm a one-man caravan
Clan? Not a part
I float so free
Mother nature and father time had a baby named me
I was born in BC and I live in AD
20/20 vision? I see in HD
Spit my LMNOP's back in elementary
Broke the record for consecutive sheckets when I was three
I guess I could explain what that means
But i never feel the need to clarify speech
It would leave you terrified if ever I preach
Never irate cuz I'm always irie
JAH the initials written on my diary
If I'm not inspiring then I'm retiring

Eyes open wide
But you can't see me
If I was your guide
Still can't see me
Might if you tried
No, you can't see me
Leave your mind petrified
You can't see me
