I-Don-t-Understand:Shy One
Just about every day
I'm trying to promote
Trying to do all that I could
Brought my CDs into a local store,
They threw it away 'cause the way I looked
Not even knowing how it sounds
I work myself when I am tired
The stores do not post my posters
And they throw away my flyers
Now.
How can I be the one
Making myself into the persons
That who will not give me the chance
I'm pulling and busting and flooding my veins,
Putting me in the spot where they
Laugh and they dance
I'm just a joke to everyone's eyes
If you look in mine, you can not deny
If you felt the force, then you can reply
Living my life every second of the time
My name will never stick in you brains
The same, It's lame, I came to bring
This music not the same
I'm an underground artist and
I'm never doubting it
Corpus Christi is my birth place
And I'm hella proud of it
But.
Even though some people seem
To be... shady.
They look down on me
But that's the thing that keeps me going
And I'm working really hard
But why bring me down?
I don't know what's going on
It's happening all around

Everywhere that I see
I see people doubting me
*Can you see? I am stuck!
And that I need help!!!*
Why don't all these people ever seem
To take the time?
*I'm going thru a maze. I'm all alone
I need your help!*

(You only realize what kind of man you are
When you feel pain you understand.)

What is wrong?
How can I go on?
Taken step by step
I'm moving slowly
And it's long
But what if I am wrong?
I'm not in it for mills
I do not talk about
Murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
I'm in my own daze
But I'm not amazed
Feeling bionic I'm not psychotic
Nor am crazed
But people want to judge me
And that's ok with me
I wish they really knew
What my music's meant to be
And they will never know
But I have much to show
Even when they pass me by
I know I'm in control
And people need to learn
I'm ahead of their time
I can hear the whole world
Every day, with an opened mind

Everywhere that I see
I see people doubting me
*can you see? I am stuck!
And that I need help!!!*
Why don't all these people ever seem
To take the time?
*Im going thru a maze. I'm all alone
I need your help!*
