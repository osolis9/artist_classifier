Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say, yeah, yeah

Wake up to bow down
To the almighty dollar, pay your homage again
Boxed in, so get down
Buried, now you're livin' underground

Do you wish you could be amongst the aristocrats
Who sip wine and look down
On the gangsta's, hustla's and things
Who make it rain and shit on the fortuneless
All in the same game struggling to get up, yeah

(Know when, know what)
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Are you a robot?)

So you a baby born with teeth
Ready to speak, the sign the end is near
His first words, uh, uh are, "Where's daddy?"
Can you hear the world stand still?

When she looked in his eyes, oh, oh, oh
She looked in his eyes, oh, oh, oh
She looked in his eyes, oh, oh, oh
Baby, I don't know, know where's the president

(Know when, know what)
Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Are you a robot?)

Say, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Know when, know what)
Uh, yeah
(Are you a robot?)

The information age is here
Then you better read the omen
There's something 'bout a natural disaster
War will never act here

A growin' thirst for power
As we approach the final hour
Monkey see, monkey do
What are you gonna do?

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
