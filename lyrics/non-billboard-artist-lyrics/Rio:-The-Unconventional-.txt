-The-Unconventional-:Rio
Take position and love will take a stand
That is the way it goes

No inquisition, no crynical demands
No-one should ever know

Because I'm dancing
Dancing to your heart
Dancing to your heart
Dancing to your heart, now baby
Oh, what a way to start
Because I'm dancing
Dancing to your heart
Dancing to your heart, now baby
What a way to start

Well, I'm trying to find
All the love we discovered
That is the way it goes

No perversion in this unconventional love
No way I'd rather see

No diversion in this unintentional love
No way I'd rather be

Because I'm dancing
Dancing to your heart
Dancing to your heart
Dancing to your heart, now baby
Oh, what a way to start

Because I'm dancing
Dancing to your heart
Dancing to your heart, now baby
What a way to start
Well, I'm trying to find
All the love we discovered
That is the way it goes
