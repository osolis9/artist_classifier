Tell-Me-How-You-Feel:Khalil
Your on my mind
At another sleepless nights
All I think about
Is I want you here and now
All I want to say,
Is that I want you in my life
I need you to hold me
You make me feel so right
There's no other words (Oh yeah)
You're everything I'm looking for and more (So tell me why)
Why are you so shy?
When your walking right by
I get this feeling inside
Baby, I want you but I don't know what to say
I see you everyday when you come around my way
I want you to know that
I'm in love with you
So baby come on, come on, come on, come on
Tell me how you feel
My friends say that I'm wasting my time
But I don't listen to them
'Cause I know your going to be mine
They don't understand
The feelings inside
All I want from you
Is that you give me a sign
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
'Cause whenever I walk by you feel me (I feel you too)
Why are you so shy?
When you walk by
I get this feeling inside
Baby, I want you but I don't know what to say (Ohhhh)
I see you everyday when you come around my way (I come around my way)
I want you to know that
I'm in love with you
So baby come on, come on
Tell me how you feel
I know (what)
It's you that holds the key into my heart
And I don't know what I would do
If I can't have your love
How you feel
Baby, I want you but I don't know what to say (I don't know what to say)
I see you everyday when you come around my way (I come around my way)
I want you to know that
I'm in love with you
So baby come on, come on, come on, come on
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
Baby, I want you but I don't know what to say (Ohhhh)
I see you everyday when you come around my way (You come around my way)
I want you to know that
I'm in love with you
So baby come on, come on
Tell me how you feel
Baby, I want
