Beauty-in-the-Sadness:Soul Supreme
Forgive me,
I truly never had a choice.
Rescue me,
Only you can gently take my hand.

On a bed of sins i pray,
Begging to remember our inmost feelings,
Every hour running from the doorway,
She's still mine.

Beauty in the sadness.
All my failures made me strong,
I've been lost for so long.
When redemption meets the blame,
I can feel you through my pain.
Beauty in the sadness.

Believe me,
Each day grateful for having you.
Deceive me,
Fragile is the mind when heart speaks.

Looking up to the skies,
Trying to get back to a single moment,
The day she touched me with her green eyes,
Between the coldness and desire.

Beauty in the sadness.
All my secrets made this song,
I'm so tired to carry on.
When redemption meets the blame,
I can feel you through my pain.
Beauty in the sadness.

I saw a garden with angels and roses,
But faith never believed in me.
Under one's breath i race with the black horses.

It was the life i chose for me.
The life i chose for me.

You have to let me go,
Where there's only love.
Let me know,
Why soul cries when there's only love.
