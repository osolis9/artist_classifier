You:King Bee
When I saw in you face
for the very first time
my heart
stood still
and the world starts to smile
I'm falling free
I fall for you
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
to you
there's a hole
in my heart
when you are not around
I don't know where to start
if I'd loose what I've found
I'm falling free
I fall for you
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
to you
dann immer das selbe
