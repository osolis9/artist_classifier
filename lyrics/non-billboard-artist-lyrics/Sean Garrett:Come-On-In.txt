Come-On-In:Sean Garrett
Ooh, damn girl, you're on fire
Ooh, damn girl, you're on fire
Ooh, damn girl, you're on fire

I know you on fire and ya man don't fuck you right
Damn, my side is cold, just come on in
I know you about it, you're gonna get your chance to show tonight
Stress no more, just come on in
Stress no more, just come on in

All the beautiful girls in the world
(From the A-town to the south of France)
Feeling they ain't gettin' enough of love
(And you're sick of what you're dealing with)

Here's a song to show you that I'm feeling
If I had you here, you know what I'd give you
The next time he hurt you bad, baby
Let me make it all okay

First I'ma come and get you good
(Out the hood, from no fear)
Don't wanna let me pull my gun
(But if I have to I will)

For two days straight Ima keep you up
(Make you feel like you ain't felt)
In my bed, hitting it like he didn't hit it bad

I know you on fire and ya man don't fuck you right
Damn, my side is cold, just come on in
I know you about it, your gonna get your chance to show tonight
Stress no more, just come on in
Stress no more, just come on in

It must be hard to spend every night and get no love
Only affection that you getting is when he hits on ya
Probably beaten but he won't be puttin' fists on ya
Girl, let me get a little aggressive, but it's gonna be good

Here's a song to show you all that I'm feeling
If I had you here you know what I'd give ya
The next time he hurt you bad, babe
Everything will be okay

First I'ma come and get you good
(Out the hood, from no fear)
Don't wanna let me pull my gun
(But if I have to I will)

For two days straight I'ma keep you up
(Make you feel like you ain't felt)
In my bed hitting it like he didn't hit it bad

I know you on fire and ya man don't fuck you right
Damn, my side is cold, just come on in
I know you about it, you're gonna get your chance to show tonight
Stress no more, just come on in
Stress no more, just come on in

See, I know you're getting out of control
(Out of control)
'Cause the one you're dealing with is really getting old
(So gettin' old)

You know I've got that brand new
Do more than ya man do
Go on and grab some chocolate before the money close
Showing you my lady, showing you're my baby

Now raise your hands up
Ohh, I forgot that way too heavy
Man, I've got to get it
And rock you steady

Better keep my baby close to my hip like a machete
I wouldn't be here for you if I didn't care
Wanna do what I do with you, shawty, and pull your hair
Is that too rough, put you in handcuffs, gotta change
You'll never be nowhere but in my care

First I'ma come and get you good
(Out the hood, from no fear)
Don't wanna let me pull my gun
(But if I have to I will)

For two days straight I'ma keep you up
(Make you feel like you ain't felt)
In my bed hitting it like he didn't hit it bad

I know you on fire and ya man don't fuck you right
Damn my side is cold, just come on in
I know you about it, you're gonna get your chance to show tonight
Stress no more, just come on in
Stress no more, just come on in

Ohh, girl, you're so fire, girl
If I give you a little taste you won't go back there
Ohh, girl, the way wind up, girl, like you know
I already see you like you real proper

Ohh, girl, you're so fire, girl
If I give you a little taste you won't go back there
Ohh, girl, the way you wind up, girl, like you know
I already see you real proper
