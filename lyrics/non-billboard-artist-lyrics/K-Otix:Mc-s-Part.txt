Mc-s-Part:K-Otix
Little inner city Willie much like myself 
Was aspiring to touch the higher reaches of wealth 
Self propelled by the propaganda of the MC's 
Glamour ride through his eyes vividly on TV 
Mesmerized by the likes of these self proclaimed G's 
Fantasized himself to be the fat rat stacking cheese 
Armani khaki jeans where they used to be Lee's 
no ties with Master Lock but now speaking of keys 
Being seized overseas in big barrels and crates 
but negated to relate he never went out of state 
Now consume the toxic logic plus the toxic fumes 
Out of tune and now assumed to be Nom De Plume 
Better known as Big Willie 
Now Don't That Sound Silly 
Favorite catch phrase Keep It Real But not really 
Still he making ends without an n 
Pushing up a jeep a Lex coupe Beemer and a Benz 
Pretends to be the baller down south slanging mo mo's 
back east he lies about ties with Mafioso 
In Philly-Illinois he rolled a Caddy Sedan 
and in Oaktown he was the Don Juan of San Fran and beyond 
With his companion on the hip and a Friday night ride down the strip 
It's a Trip 
Look inside the ride MC number 9 by his side sippin' Cristal wine 
Tried her best to look fine Wasn't really worth the time 
Just an imitation of Will's fraud state of mind 
Caught me by surprise. But then I read between the lines 
Heard through the grapevine #5 wrote your rhymes 
Check the signs See the decline of income 
Going out for the crumb Your style's still dumb 
#10 was the label mate of # 8&9 
Whining like a beaatch and bottom line couldn't rhyme 
Shining in the lime light but couldn't rhyme tight 
No originality Strictly sound bites 
Downright about the worst that I heard verse to verse 
Every word was a curse to the ear 
Preferred not to hearing his song 
But no choice but to listen on 
His LP wasn't even worth pissing on 
Dancin' a jig and thinking he was jiggy 
Everybody's picking him to be the next 
But he was over shadowed by the face in the camera 
#11 his producer slash manager 
Slash amateur slash rapper slash actor slash tapper 
the hit song jacker New nod factor 
turned playboy when he dropped the Craig Macker 
Making rap wacker Ain't mad at ya 
But weekly you tempt me to pimp me the new jiggy on Mtv 
The Magnum Cum Laude of my PhD 
I was hating from the jump when you became an MC 
Trying to keep it real Without a trace of rap skill 
At first it was chill But now it's like over kill 
Wanted to build the rep of material objects 
R&b; niggas switching from rap to rock sets 
Yet once again neither one saw the signs 
#10's simple mind combined with simple rhymes 
defined the prime reason why we had to make it twice 
You need to stop rocking ice Learn to rock a mic 
I hope my words come as a shock Get off your own jock 
Probably why everybody's taking shots 
Now it's all about the Benjamins, but 
I'm calling out your feminine strut 
Plus it wasn't a surprise that 11 had to capitalize 
Off the late great #8's sudden demise 
Cut the lies that he tried to keep it honest 
Talkin' 'bout flossin' 
when he shoulda seen an orthodontist 
Making promises that he wasn't fulfillin' 
People by the millions Saying they wasn't feeling em 
I guess in all the Hype like William started killin' em 
Dealing in the same fate as their late friend 
Once again 
There you have it 11 MC's laid to rest
