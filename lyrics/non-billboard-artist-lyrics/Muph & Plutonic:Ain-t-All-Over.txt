Ain-t-All-Over:Muph & Plutonic
[Verse 1:]
They call me a bad drunk, but a good sober
Forget last nights' finer details to look over
Why don't you just follow my foot odour?
Polluting through the exhaust of this crook, motor the book's closure
It's no closer to over
Pullover then put it, into overdrive
Ants in their pants gotta get their mouths open wide
Oversize baggage, I'm savage with the grind date
Over the hill, chill gave me a migraine
Overwhelmed by the ego-overdosed crime rate
Over-compensate for the lack of skills
That's a hefty fine mate
Game over, you better get sober and go find a blind date

[Hook: x2]
It ain't all over!
"Look around"
We'll keep it coming til we're pushing up daisies
No buts, ifs, hows or maybes
Cause... [First time only]

[Verse 2:]
Overkill, standing over a dead rap career
Blood overspill, like what the hell happened here?
Overdone special effects and it ain't all over yet
We ain't going nowhere but we wanna go somewhere yep
The over-rated, you rappers ain't my biggest threat
Over-exposed MC's even ugly in their silhouettes
I'm still impressed by? Eltham?, I tell em that life is such
I'm well over these rappers thinking they can touch the Muph
But I'm a over-protect these raps in a chastity belt, I keep em buckled up
But they still try to butter me up but
I'm not that way inclined
I'm over-anxious analysing these desirable rhymes
Gripping mics started as a hobby
Now they want me to put them down, over my dead body
When the carpet finally carpets the ground
You got me? You got me now?

[Hook: x2]
It ain't all over!
"Look around"
We'll keep it coming til we're pushing up daisies
No buts, ifs, hows or maybes
Cause... [First time only]

[Verse 3:]
Now I'm waiting for the day the mobile is a microwave
Now overlook the overcook that overtook my china plates
Why they hibernate to cyberspace
Over-the-moon-to-find-a-place that violates the haters
Just a dry root in a sumo suit, don't feel much
Take this, break it down to whatever you feel
OK, my mind spray ain't Lipton tea
It's Listerine to fry decay
Overall I'm a find my way, ain't the final day
The tidal wave flow to flood the terrains overgrowth
So below the mark, bird's eye view from the overpass
No overlord, just an open bar
Welcome with open arms and a broken charm
Still going when they close the path

[Hook: x2]
It ain't all over!
"Look around"
We'll keep it coming til we're pushing up daisies
No buts, ifs, hows or maybes
Cause... [First time only]
