Bajo-sexto:Chingon
I heard he played the deathnail for a big band,
He drank himself into an early grave.
He carried a gun and a bottle of tequila,
His fingers flew like fire when he played.

Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Play it slowly, play it soft and low.
Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Johnny‘s laying down now six below.

He played for women and he played for money,
He took their silver and he took their fame.
He followed them into their secret bedrooms.
He made the wildest cats go calm and tame.

Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Play it slowly, play it soft and low.
Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Johnny‘s laying down now six below.

At last he danced with a lady, who was taken,
He twirled her once to many on the floor.
Her husband was man of great importance,
Now Johnny isn’t dancing anymore.

Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Play it slowly, play it soft and low.
Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Johnny‘s laying down now six below.

Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Play it slowly, play it soft and low.
Play the bajo sexto now for Johnny,
Johnny‘s laying down now six below.

Johnny‘s laying down now six below.
