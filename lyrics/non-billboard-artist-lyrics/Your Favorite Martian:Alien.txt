Alien:Your Favorite Martian
Have you ever felt left out of the group, excluded?

Given the boot
when you knew you should have been a shoo-in?

Like, some ancient Druid
was pursuant to ruin your life,
with curse but worse,
he brought his whole damn crew in.

And now it's high noon,
and you're a target to shoot at.

This school's a battlefield.
No wonder you're truant!

They always look at you and,
they boo at what you're doing
and you go off like a bomb at the Olympics in Munich.

Nah, you're just an extraterrestrial,
less than respectable.
You'll never get to get the girl.

You're just a jester a the festival.
I guess it's acceptable,
to peg your head with vegetables and kick you in the testicles.

And best off all let you know that you're a filthy dog and you'll never be best in show.

So why the abuse?

'Cause all a bully needs is fucking excuse!

Planet Earth, I need a friend 'cause I'm on the outside looking in.
I'm an Alien.
I'm just an Alien.

Feeling lost but never found,
'til i found myself being pushed around.
I'm an Alien.
Yes, I'm an Alien.

I'mma be honest, it gets better, I promise.
So don't let the ground you down to a pound of sawdust.

Stay on the stage the longest 'til the gong hits and everybody comments on their fondness of your polish and your overall knowledge.

Remain calmest and abolish your modesty 'cause honestly, you got to be positive.
You're a prodigy!

You show the world that you're not one to mess with.
It's a broken home that makes these bastards aggresive.

You can expect to get rejected,
neglected, stripped naked, and tested 'til they reckon.

You feel terrible because nothing is comparable.
Violence ain't the answer but the pain is unbearable.

You're nice and jaded from being isolated, now you coast through life feeling twice as hated.

So why the abuse?

'Cause all a bully needs is a fucking excuse!

Planet Earth, I need a friend 'cause im on the outside looking in.
I'm an Alien.
I'm just an Alien.

Feeling lost but never found,
'till i found myself being pushed around.
I'm an Alien.
Yes, I'm an Alien.

Axel on the drums!

RUN!

Well, Planet Earth, I need a friend,
'cause im on the outside looking in.
I'm an Alien.
I'm just an Alien.

Oh,
feeling lost but never found,
'til i found myself being pushed around.
I'm an Alien.
Yes, I'm an Alien.
No Ohhh!
I'm an Alien.
Yes, I'm an Alien.
Ohhh.
