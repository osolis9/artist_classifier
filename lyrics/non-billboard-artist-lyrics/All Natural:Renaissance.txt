Renaissance:All Natural
Sitten at the lake front
Working on my next LP
Fifty-fith of LSD
Ya, you a see
You see something about the water man it soothes the soul
It rinses cleanses it keeps us all
I swear without nature I'd go insane
all these concrete streets I can't maintain
I woke up this morning and a file the room so I came to the lake to change my attitude with in my altitude
with the black in mind
I'm wondering what made malcom smile
with all this hate and ostracism how do people maintain any optimism sometimes I think I'm loosing mine
If I aint writing or producing then I'm loosing my mind.
