Back-to-The-Stars:Until the Ribbon Breaks
I was born with my back to the stars
Turn me over, I'd like to see
Here comes the morning, to end this dream
Turn me over, I'd like to see

And you, what have you done for me
You've opened up my eyes, you've opened up my eyes

If I died with my back to the stars
Would you see that they'd tell my truth?
That I did what I could, that I tried to be kind
You can ask my girl for the proof
She's a picture, you're a picture
And you fill up both of my eyes
Oh I see you, just know I see you
In the pink of summer sky

And you, what have you done for me
You've opened up my eyes, you've opened up my eyes

And you, what have you done for me
You've opened up my eyes, you've opened up my eyes

April showers, good May
Warm June, it's July soon
Here come the months, I watch them go
Will you still love me when it snows?

And you, what have you done for me
You've opened up my eyes, you've opened up my eyes

And you, what have you done for me
You've opened up my eyes, you've opened up my eyes
