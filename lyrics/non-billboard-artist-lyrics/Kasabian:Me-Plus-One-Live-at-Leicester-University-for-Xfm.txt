I'm too messed up just at the thought of you.
Where'd you get that smile and the fine hair
I get my kicks from you walkin'
see that girl i see the pyramids,

say

you can't take me away
like a little white rabbit from yesterday
little things said have said enough
I should have shot myself on the run.

I want love love love.
I want love love love right now
I want love love love.
I want love love love right now so come on.

She comes back from the winter
Looking straight into my eyes
Now I'm standing like a lunatic
I bet you feel I bet you see scared. Saying,

You come take me away,
like a little white rabbit from yesterday
little things said have said enough
I should have shot myself on the run.

I want love love love.
I want love love love right now
I want love love love.
I want love love love right now so come on.
