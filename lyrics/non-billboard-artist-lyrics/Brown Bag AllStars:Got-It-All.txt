Got-It-All:Brown Bag AllStars
We got it all
soo.?
So tell your friends about consept
And all the things you heard 'em say
Rock your neck so hard that he can break your vertebrae
team will make the murder rate increase when they servin', aim
The innocent bystanders as we bond standin' in LA
Maximized labels got more prisoners than Alcatraz
System got more chips than Bill Gates data has
'madafact
Im gonna break myself out of it
When lines so heavy they rebedded from the sound of it
The unsigned lasted
Don't undermind greatness
Don't wonder why these other guys don't fuck with my placement
I follow in no guidelines
A father a wild rhyme
Im clocking in, astonishing,
Im polishing my 'shantan (Its sort of simmilar to a syclone)
I write poems with sick sickneble synergy
'Memberin the effects of injested hennessy (Speak...)
Shit(oh shit), Religiusly like, christ was dizzy
CVD, opivity of this music you use if pitifully
Ive been
Typically know for getting silly for years
Recently ive been lazy lying(yawn)
Search similary here
It'll be wierd when i crush your career without tryin'
Like steppin' on mat hills your man yells then(silence)
We giants who leave your section like a war zone
Whores all nice but we rocking like the doors goone
(doors gone?)Yeah its of the hinges(Oooooh)
when i kick it, shit no biggie
When the Brown bags and your sister
makes your sister wanna lick me
So your sounds kinda stale and chewy like old prok rhymes
While we swing the boom like a sailor tryna' portside
Short fry?
You can never fuck with us, don't try
My shit drops, the beat stops, the hip hop, apartheid

Well im the cock of the walk
Other motherfuckers are chicken shit
Sticken with conditions that only my perscription fits
Syphilis slang they got the climmets congested
Its simple and plain for you to mimmic the best kid
But you aint on the level to start ere'
with the devil 'encarnate
Her lengend, my art
He's in the dredded, its just far fetched
her scar techs elacirate your veteran
confusin' new jacks and captivatin' veterans
Castivate, who's better than who
Better than who?
I prefer to chill and exist
To still in the bliss
cause even villages wish
That 'out the kill and assist
They could just recline without the feel of the wrist
So come beat Jhon foremans crelled' abyss
Untill he recognizes that im as ill as it gets
'pom cruize gets fuck you'ze
To sell with the dead
Brown bag got the syllabus grip
Check it out (Haha)
Hey yo, they speak of change yet not one thing is different
Reach deep into my pockets but now all i feel is 'litn 'it
Its common to try and find forever,
wether or not
They understand they should try to chase symphony
Im self sientific
Kill it, start it, 'imma finnish it
in reason, its deep
Can't recyclye what im speaking
My logic, these words are rightful triggerd in my feelings
My counsin just came back from Iraq
His mother squeezed him
Like the trigger on his rifle back in Iraq
He got home, didn't know that he would have to adapt
To the change, eveything is different, time moved on
Friends don't speak to one another
nothing the same since hes gone
Life spinning out of control
Feel deep in his soul
It only took him 2 years time
to loose everything that he owned
To cause a dope from clocks hand
The locket changed in time
They only thing that you can't stop
So you aint wasti'n mind, no.
