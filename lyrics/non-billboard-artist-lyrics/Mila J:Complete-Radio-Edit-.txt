Nobody wants to be with somebody
That let's you have your way all the time, you know
Everybody wants to be with somebody that's strong
True story 'cause when you're weak you need somebody
That's gonna pick you up and make you complete

There's been times that you flipped on me
'Cause I was wrong and I liked it
There's been times I've called
And it went straight to voice mail and I liked it

There's been times you gave me closure,
Apologized then you cried on my shoulder
And I was in your drive way before you fixed your lips
To say come over, no matter what it is 'cause I'm there for you

Hold up, wait a minute, shh shh let me finish
I just wanna holla at you, I bet you finish my sentence
'Cause you know where my mind is
Baby you know where my heart lives with you

You make my life complete, everything
You make everything sour, sweet, everything
You are everything
Baby, you make everyday complete

You make my life complete
Baby you bring out the best in me
You are everything
Baby, you make everyday complete

There's been times people try to come between us
And I can't stand it
Sometimes I feel like the world is against us
I can't understand it, damn it

But you always find a way to escape the world
You love your homies, but you never put them before your girl
You said the beauty in me outweigh the wrong
And you've been waitin' for somebody like me so long

Come sit between my legs and let me rub you
No need to argue, I just wanna love you, love you boy
All I can do is think about you
Baby, I'm too optimistic to doubt you

You make my life complete
You make everything sour, sweet
You are everything
Baby, you make everyday complete

You make my life complete
Baby you bring out the best in me
You are everything
Baby, you make everyday complete

You are everything and everything is you
You're a part of all my dreams
You're in my heart and can't be removed
You mean the world to me and every word I say is true
You are everything and everything is you

You make my life complete
You make everything sour, sweet
You are everything
Baby, you make everyday complete

You make my life complete
Baby, you bring out the best in me
You are everything
Baby, you make everyday complete, thank you

Now I hope I made a statement
That love, it will never go out of style
And strength, strength will carry you
You understand if you're a real man you do
Now I want you to ask yourself, Do you deserve me?
Can you make me complete? We'll see
