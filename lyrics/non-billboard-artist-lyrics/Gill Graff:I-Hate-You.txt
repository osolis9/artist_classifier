I-Hate-You:Gill Graff
[Verse 1]
don’t be mad at me 
cuz I waited too long, now I gotta break away, cuz its time to breathe
it’s a bitter angry feeling but the pain is sweet 
wont be manipulated wit that famous weep,
cuz things aint how we planned to be, and I'm no plan b
and I wont to get stepped on like a stampede
I was playing for keeps, now we can’t meet
Cuz everytime we face to face we get angry
And now the Tables turn
How can you expect things you aint earn
Having the respect wasn’t your main concern
Gotta put u through it so you’re able to learn
Everyday I turn, Another page is burned 
And I no longer yurn, for that long term
And just know that, we don’t belong
And I just hope that , you don’t return 
You don’t return

[Hook]
[Girl: oh, I was the only one]

[Gill Graff] You were the only one .. 
Little did I know you had just begun
Discovered a new you … I thought I knew you.. you gave me a new view

[Girl: So I was the only lonely one]
[Gill Graff]
And I aint Going back
Ill be damn if I fall in the same ol trap

[Chorus]
we’re all in
we spiral down
it’s a war within
whose shooting now?
better call the law 
we died a little
aint afraid to fall
it aint better witcha’

[Verse 2]

funny how things change
no dimes, when I noticed you a bit strange
those lies, made it clear that you switch lanes 
no ride, so I hit her wit the kick game
for those times that you made me feel insane
couldn’t help but think that I been framed
you said things will be better but it just aint
cuz every word outta your mouth is a complaint, 
you’re no saint
and every second, every minute, every day, every week, 
was a breath of fresh air - now everytime that we speak
feels like we got less, and there’s always beef 
and when it seems it’s gonna end, always it repeats
it’s a vicious cycle, this bitch is fucking psycho
always say the wrong shit, you’re a walkin typo
the same ol story and it always gets recycled 
cant even talk without ever feelin spiteful

[Hook]
[Girl] Really, we had the perfect end…
That night we shared at the Comfort Inn…
We made love like the world would have ended…
If either of us had admitted.. We were in love…( whole thing x2)

[Gill Graff]
You held me down x 2
And I remember when we …
