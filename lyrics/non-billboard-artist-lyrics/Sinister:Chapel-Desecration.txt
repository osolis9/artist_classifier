Chapel-Desecration:Sinister
Implement Fear
 Deprive them of their sacred pride
 In a murderous frenzy
 As if possessed and justified

 Straw man, figurehead, renegade...warlord
 Kill and mass, first in front
 Sudden decline
 A dying of archaic hopes
 This must be obeyed
 It's Vexing to admit you're wrong

 Ruminate, precipitate, chaos run amuck
 Incinerate, eradicate, intellect absorbed

 Further decline
 The state of feeling death approach
 By an act of aggression
 And pernicious evil thoughts

 Straw man, figurehead, renegade...warlord

 Implement Fear
 Deprive them of their sacred pride
 In a murderous frenzy
 As if possessed and justified

 Straw man, figurehead, renegade...warlord

 [solo: Pascal]

 Ruminate, precipitate, incinerate, eradicate

 [solo: Pascal]

 Further decline
 The state of feeling death approach
 By an act of aggression
 And pernicious evil thoughts

 Straw man, figurehead, renegade...warlord
