[ D-Loc ]
D-Loc's the name, I got a thang against police
Nigga, I'm straight from the streets
Fuck a punk in a blue suit
Wanna get em up, let's go, but I just might blast you
In this game the rules is you lose
Duck to the side but you still get choosed
If I miss, shit, you ain't save
My homeboy Rich kicks up the backfire
[ Richie Rich ]
So on the first note I'm steppin off like this
A brother only gets through life if he's serious
Givin ain't shit, but see, takin is a method
Even if you use a weapon
You see, the law ain't straight, so why follow it
I'd rather have you give me some poison and say 'swallow it'
But now fuck that, I'm much sharper
I eat and shit too, but I'm much darker
So on the strenght of my color I get pushed and harassed
Taken to jail with no questions asked
It's sort of like apartheid, there's no peace
We're holdin court in the streets

(Better luck out suckers)
[ Richie Rich ]
As a positive gangster with the motive to move on the Town
Uzis greased, ski masks pulled down
And when it's time to move I roll a bucket
So if I kill up shit, fuck it
I'm up outta there, it's time to hit me a fence
Ditch my gat and get a room at the SixPence
Shower and change to get up out of the black
And then I'm back
I'm in the streets again, I read a paper
That says: At large
A killer with a helluva charge
His name was Richie Rich
His motive - to start shit
You got a gat and badge, I'm not duckin
Fuck the Klans, the Kluin and the Kluckin

You see, I know that shit
