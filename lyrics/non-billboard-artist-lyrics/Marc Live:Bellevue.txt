Bellevue:Marc Live
[35 second intro - unknown voice speaking in French + more]
[Marc Live]
The club is crazy, the bar is bananas (uhh)
The floor is danger, the bottles are magnum (say what?)
The girls are naked, the models are down son
My niggaz is ready, we wanna get down, come
There's seven booths and they filled with rounds what
Them kids is lookin, yo they nothin they clowns Dunn
It's not a problem yo (that's right) the afterparty
yo will be more sicker tons of Bacardi and dark liquor (let's go)
Mob quicker, hard livin, yo the most party
The longest night you ever seen it's early mornin son
We out in hell (uh-huh) yo I don't know
if she couldn't talk with my head in her mouth, we over now
Cause next time, next scene, yo with someone else
We hit 'em with vowels, the shit is so mean (so mean)
So don't scheme (don't scheme) and yo be watchin yo
We might be gone but the tec can still launch you bro
[Chorus x2: Marc Live (Sinistre)]
It's crazy, it's Bellevue retarded, it's animal
[can't translate]
It's rap, it's gangster, street music for the peeps
[can't translate]
[Marc Live]
Yo, we did it again, we winnin again (that's right)
To chain this beast, the big East'll come see
It's not easy, no magazine, no blueprint
You can't follow the team follow the green
We rode caravan, everything triple black
You can think it, we got that, we cop that
Drop that (drop that) it's not records and tapes
It's the hustle react, so step back (step back)
The re-up, who need the weed, come rush (come rush)
The girls get ski dust, it's the cream come up
You gotta see us (uh) jump in the whipper
It's "Live" on your TV with Kelly Ripa (Kelly Ripa)
I'm primetime like Koppel but you know I stick ya
Yo you know how it gets in the club, listen
It gets hot, you get hit in the club (that's right)
A big bottle of Bel', a split wig in the club
[Chorus]
[Sinistre: best guess]
Chicks I meet at the club, the show
They got shot a dick side, they go again fo' sho'
Make a show, the what gets shown
You must admit "Yeah he macho"
Bless your feet, fam [?] comes to my show
Shish-ba-chi-ching, skee-wee-va-chi-ching
[?], cross my pin, a pin-pin's all I been been
Excuse my steez, it's crews when I lend, Heineken
It never end, and so we can, jumpin kin
This is crazy [?] this is crazy [?]
This is crazy [?] c'est la vie [?]
Some duck duck, me duck ain't gon' fuck with soul
[?] special, this here is schizo

Now off the art of noise, see a [?] buy a gun
And set fi, mami die, if a [?]
A fool while I seen the pen [?]
[Chorus]
