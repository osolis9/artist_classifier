Saving-My-Love-For-You:KEM
Ever since time was young
Ever since there were trees and sun
Long before earth was new
I've been saving my love for you

(Saving my love)

Long before waterfalls and rain
Long before winters turned to spring
There was light shining through
And I was saving my love for you

(Saving my love)

Long before birds learned to fly
You had reign over my life
Before the mountains and streams
I could feel you loving me babe
Long before rainbows and marigolds
And all that we've been through
You were my dream come true
And I was saving my love for you

(Saving my love, saving my love)

Long before land and sea
Long before life had come to be
Even all the angels knew
I'd be saving my love for you

(Saving my love)

I'll be saving my love for you
