Yeah, yeah
Why say?

We met, we talked, we liked, we called, we texted, we dated, we committed, I loved you, you cheated, we're done, you're deleted, I gotta go. Why, why did you lie?
I gave you my heart and you tore it apart. And now I gotta go.
Why did you lie?
If I gave you my love. But now it's over.

I've been in love since the day I met you babe.
That was the song, that was on.
The day you ran into my eyes.

I don't know why you have to lie.
Baby don't want no lie.
I'm telling you I'm leavin and I'm really about to go.
