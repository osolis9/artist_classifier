Act-Like-a-Bitch:Ebony Eyez
(feat. J-Kwon & Tarboy (Trackboyz))
[Ebony Eyez: Talking] 
Ayo... Tar... you ready? 
[Tarboy from Trackboys: Talking] 
Yeah.uh 
[Ebony Eyez] 
Let's Do dis. 
[Chorus: Tarboy] 
Look.uh. 
Money ain't never move me... 
Dawg, dis ain't a movie 
This is real life, so why you tryin' to do me? 
Sit back and relax and think about the past 
And make your next move your best, it might be your last 
[Chorus: Ebony Eyez] 
Look. 
Money ain't never move me. 
Bitch this ain't a movie 
Dis is real life, so why you tryin' to do me? 
Sit back and relax and think about the past 
And make your next move your best, it might be your last 
[Verse 1: Tarboy] 
Look... 
Money don't make the man 
but still, I understand 
if you ain't gettin' dough, what the fuck you in this for? 
I see you chasin hoes, and all your fancy clothes 
you say you hate the music, then why you at the show? 
What all that yappin' mean? 
how the fuck that fit the plan? 
where the fuck you from homeboy? 
you ain't from my land 
I see you in the club, in the corner mean-mugged 
with all your little thugs, go pop a bottle of bub 
and think about it first 
and drink away your problems 
before a nigga out here on the streets help you solve them 
see, I ain't mad at ya 
I'm just tryin' to relax you 
and teach you somethin' homie, before them killers snatch you 
I try to keep it thorough 
Keith done been around the world 
and never understood how a man could act like a girl 
but see I'm just a squirrel 
and this is your world 
and I wish you the best 
so get it off your chest 
[Chorus: Tarboy] 
[Chorus: Ebony Eyez] 
[Verse 2: Ebony Eyez] 
Louie, done made my purse 
well, he ain't write this verse 
some people put they money first, and don't care who they hurt 
always talkin' bout how they: finna do this and finna do that 
finna get that new benz and finna buy they girl a cadillac 
I try to mind my business, they strike at me with a vengence 
don't know I'm young and visicious and know how to throw them fist-es 
say I dont keep it real, (what?) say I ain't got the skill 
(we) mad cause I got a deal, give a fuck bout how you feel 
I represent the streets and that's the way you gotta be 
and when my album drop, some people gon' be mad at me 
bitches don't wanna listen, don't wanna play position 
ain't got a pot to piss in, but they call they self dissin' 
your next move should always be your best move 
never follow what the rest do, and they'll respect you 
Cause money come and go, don't front like you don't know 
and when it's all spend up and gone, you ain't got shit to show 
[Chorus: Tarboy] 
[Chorus: Ebony Eyez] 
[Verse 3: J-Kwon] 
Now my baby mama hate the fact, now that I'm gettin' scratch 
so she go and react, hold up man, matter of a fact 
now that I'm thinkin' back, when I ain't had no scratch 
no ice, or no 'lac, hold up Kwon rewind it back 
now was you gon' react? 
that's when I hate the fact, I laid her on her back 
(hold up man, don't say that) 
nah, let me spit the facts 
y'all know I love my son, but she only care about if he got some air force ones 
Now ain't that shit dumb? Now where we both come from 
Like all your life, you grew up running around spending funds 
We was broke as Hammer, t-shirts for pajamas 
Cribs small as llamas, eating corn flakes and bananas 
Now it's vests and Hummers, we fucked the whole summer 
The only reason, cause your man be tryin to take me under 
So now I sit and wonder, like I ain't got no clue 
And yes it's true, that the money might have moved you 
[Chorus: Tarboy] 
[Chorus: Ebony Eyez]
