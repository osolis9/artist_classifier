Featuring-Grand-Master-Dee:Whodini
Now the party didn't start till I walked in
And I probably won't leave until the thing ends
But in the meantime, the in between time
If you work your thing then I'll work mine

We came here together so we could have fun
Me and you, baby, going one on one
Now this is the last chance for us to get off
So either get loose or you ought to get lost

'Cause I'm just about ready to do my thing
'Cause I'm the stone cold, New York, Rap Machine
I'ma give you what I got and baby, that's plenty
You'll never have one that rocks so many

I'ma make you wet and make you sweat
Just to see how funky you can get
Now when I'm on the mic, I do serve well
And I go by the name of the Rapper Jalil

Four minutes left

Now sit back, relax, put on your head gear
Get ready for a trip through the atmosphere
Gonna take you for a ride through the twilight zone
I don't need a space ship, I use my microphone

So hold on tight with all your might
'Cause I'll be rapping like this for the rest of the night
It's Jalil, y'all, your master rapper
And when I'm on the mic it's a sheer disaster

'Cause MCs crumble when we rumble
Some think I'm soft just because I'm humble
So all you MCs, I hope you're real good listeners
'Cause in this battle, I'm taking no prisoners

I'm slaying MC's right on the spot
'Cause I'm the the master of the rap, the doctor of the rock
The jack of all trades, the master of one
And the thing I'm at is called having fun

We got three minutes left to rock this funk
To separate the good stuff from the junk
So get in the groove and feel the sound
And once you're inside, spread yourself around

From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
Come on Master Dee, get funky while we got 'em

Three minutes left

Me and my partner from the start
We usually get together after dark
Sometimes to rap, sometimes to sing
In the summer or the winter 'cause it ain't no thing

And ever since I first came 'round
Side by side, we'd throw down
We came here to this here place
To serve you all right to your face

Because this jam here is our show stopper
We didn't wanna do it but I guess we gotta
We're the men of the hour
Making the ladies scream and holler

To hot to trot, to sweet to be sour
I'm gonna set the record straight
And I hope that it is not too late
If you want the best, I won't settle for less

Put your money on me, I'm your best bet
Come on, one for the treble, two for the Bass
Three for the ladies, four for the plaid

Five minutes of funk, this ain't no junk
So pull your bottom off the tree stump
Ladies real pretty from city to city
But now we're getting down to the nitty gritty

From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
I'm gonna rock 'em while I still got 'em
Our rapping shower has style and power
And this is our disco hour

I don't know what all of you have heard
So it's up to me to spread the word
About the man that we feel has got to be real
Our crowned prince on the wheels of steel

He goes by the name of Grandmaster Dee
So if it's alright with you, it's alright with me
We gonna rock you people's minds with ease
With some help from the Maestro, if you please

One minute left

I'm sorry your five minutes are up
Please begin your ending
Or your volume will be terminated
