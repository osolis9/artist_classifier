Eternal-Boundlessness:ATMA
Who am I? I'm the substance that will make your third eye cry
Who Jah bless, let no man curse
Who am I? I'm the substance that will make your third eye cry
Who Jah bless, let no man curse
Ill be on 'em like a message from god
Who Jah bless, let no man curse
Knowledge of self will make emcees play hard

The transcendental autocrat beyond birth and death
On the path of perfection with the map of the essence
I eternally endeavor, know the ledge, god head elevation
The matchless gift in this garden of God
I see the spiritual world
But it's hard to see through this illusory movie
I strive to be conscious of my own immortality
Ineffable vision beyond the astral sphere
So ascend within innerspace, deathless, samadhi
Aware I'm not the body but the physical
The astral, the causal, the spirit soul be infinity
Underneath the three bodies made of light drawn energy
Self-manifested pure consciousness
Will laugh at death, throw off a bag of flesh
Several bodies a fusion, ready for ascension
Through infinite dimensions, no fear, no tension
Bust the science of the self, realization of the soul
Transmigration of the atma transpersonal
I'm on the inner journy through the spirutual skies
Back to godhead, the kingdom of God is realized
Know you're not the body or the mind in this illusionary world
Not of it, look above it, son
Cuz it's truely not the place for we, look 3rd visually
A place of birth, old age, death, and suffering

We're internal, with eternal boundlessness
The inner self spark of God be infinite
Y'all, light's too bright for unawakened eyes of men
I transcend, bend space-time, ascend
Through the internal, eternal boundlessness
The inner self spark of God be infinite
Y'all, light's too bright for unawakened eyes of men
Peace be still, know God dwells within

The observer is the universe, I said it, yo
Prophetic through phonetic flows
Rapping intellects with introspect, son
Check the way of reason, sages versus demons
Pages of soliliquois and the things be in the void
I meditate fast, pray past the Milky Way
Seven chakra galaxies lay within inner space
Youth the age, birth to death, the dead weight of inertia
Takes the breath back to the unmanifest
Perceive 3rd visually, within lies eternity
In the world of illusion, cosmic delusion
Made of atoms molecules, subatomic particles
Five elements, mind intelligence
The dream consciousness of the omnipresent person
Infinite universes eminate from his pores
Billions of galaxies full of planets be the Lord's
See the source within all and the all within the stars
The one has become many. Who sent me?
A phoenix, when in flight I give light to dark cities
Full of strangers, anger, psychic torture chambers
I make them split in two, spittin' jewels at these fools

I came to bring the science that God's rocking the stages
I am no man, from no man's land, the nomad of the ancients
Beyond the bounds of physical science, mystical reliance
My constructing power building towers in defiance
The lions' meditation becomes communication
Mad spirits descend through the tongue of the seraphim
Blend quantum physics, revelations of the mystics
Transpersonal psychology, ideology infinite
The etheric cord resonates universal law
From the breath of the creator made from two arms of God
All glories to Bhagavan, my pulse Paramatma
Killing demonic contact, last lap around the zodiac
Beyond solar systems and astrological archetypes
Pure light and effulgence emanates from the mic
Omni lyrical incarnations, bars from star constellations
Celestial geometry, tetrahedran isocoles
Toss emcees with the God degree
Through the all-seeing eye divine hypotheses
From subtle to gross, I studied the Most High
The 3rd eye awoke from the psychic slumber
