This-Is-the-Thanks-You-Get-feat-Nuttz-:The Relativez
Motherfuckers just don't know how to watch they mouth
This next song is dedicated to Daz coming from the bloom
You betta watch ya ass
Nowhere to run to baby nowhere to hide its got nowhere to run
Its break bread morphy
And we going against the grain on this one
All those funny hucka bucka ass niggas
Wearing All Stars and braids in they videos huh
Niggas wearing khaki suits and beanies freaking the guns
Pioneers a gangsta rap but where they from (where they from)
I rather listen to real niggas rest in peace Big Pun
And Mossberg superior my prayers of love
Popped Don nigga start the west was done (what)
Don't forget gangsta shit is how the west was won (yeah)
We trying to have benz and thangs and lacs on thangs
So turn to the whoop whoop leave a squares of the rain
What you faking hard for
Gangsta rap will turn East coast boy what a ho
Red rag around my mouth on the beach cruising boat
I will see Jay fuck Dre blood is a dyke
And even when the rap shows over
Its back to the block to hang and bang and slang crackola
Mack 10 deep down you know you ain't no banger
You got paid left Englewood right with the Lakers
Oh you the niggas that started this gangsta shit (say what)
Well this the motherfucking thanks you get (ha)
Its time somebody come and tell the world the real
That you niggas was a fake and never banged for real
Oh you the niggas that started this gangsta shit
Well this the motherfucking thanks you get
Its time somebody come and tell the world the real
That you niggas was a fake and never banged for real
Just too gangsta too gangsta
Four live respect from both sides
Fuck Hollywood we in the hood where we low ride
It ain't about sex no more
Niggas you betta fake you to give or you taking progressive procrastinate
Shoulda stayed boring dog calls want it all
Nuts hang farther than y'all
Weed thing harder than y'all
Quick to get up in it
Behind tint and a slant nose rolling doja
Niggas that bang for real
The cars and the hoes
No got the block lock and twist on gold
Consisting with flows and throw the disses on toes
You niggas wanna bang the block can't hang the block
And schools and barber shops swearing each slanging rocks
Who know from floor spots and got it active on the block (moss)
Off thirty six months and got thirty two month
Recount the nines on so that all grams (ha ha)
See me I came up poor in the game
Cap a scrap cap a gangsta regardless the fame
Whatcha know about young niggas striking the wall
Whatcha know about buying a burger and cooking it off
Whatcha know about the pen and only been to the halls
Whatcha know about The Relatives, Big Y, and The Dog
Theres nothing rougher than me
Original break bread morphy pushing the line
You ain't from the streets
You had lost your mind
In Atlanta phenom videos faking the crime
And Xzibit nigga you funny as hell
Claiming rip before your album sale
I'm socking you blood
Over here we get high and only fuck with that indo indo indo indo
If you banging in traffic throw it up out the window window window window
Over here we get high and only fuck with that indo indo indo indo
If you banging in traffic throw it up out the window window window window
The Relatives, Dog, and Big Y
Here to give it up for my real niggas
Who been down since day one
Get ya smash on niggas (say what)
