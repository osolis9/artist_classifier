Hip-Hop-Music:Phanatik
How do you like your Hip-hop music
Some like it holy, some like it polluted
Some like a crew like The Movement
In tune with the blueprint of Heaven consumed with Life
Hip-hop on a higher level
Hip-hop is not evil, Hip-hop was not created by the Devil
It's just like every other music form
Your soul's been searching for one since you've been born
Looking for something to express
That rhythmic pattern bumpin' in your chest
And it just so happens that these cats rappin'
Have tapped into a key of life, and it strikes for so many people
In so many regions, rap is the way to reach 'em
Nothing is equal, it's as classic as classical
And probably more spiritual than most of the spirituals that you know
That's not just cause I do it
Nope, not just cause it's my music
Nope, but that is how I use it so
I just thought that you should know
I love what it was and what it's become
Musically but between you and me I hate what it's done
How it's run and how the songs of every singer
Sound like sound tracks to match shows of Jerry Springer
We live to it, look at what we did to it
Or what it did to us this is not just music
It's not kid music, these are grown men
On the microphone who like to condone their own sin
For us it's holy ground, Hip-hop is holy now
Long as I got the microphone I'm a hold it down
But when I pass the mic back it's back to you know what
But we don't recommend you listen I mean you know us

It aint nothing like Hip-hop music
It aint nothing like, it aint nothing like
It aint nothing like Hip-hop music
It's not wrong or right it's how you use it fam

Don't let these radio programs through
All they want to do is program you
Hip-hop to the slow jams too
Trying to turn young cats into macks
While keeping our shorties on there backs
Giving it up, all in the name of living it up
Living large off of charge cards with limited bucks
In your pocket, riding with sin like a sidekick
That don't make sense, check the logic
Today's top topics are topless cars and chicks
That's easy, but rhymes are hard to kick
Even if I'm not one of your favorite artists
I'll still set this joint a ablaze like a arsonist
Hip-hop is our and it's a mirror of our hearts
And this is harsh but listen our appearance is marred
If you don't like what you see in the Hip-hop glass
Know the future is a present from the Hip-hop past
And if you don't like the gift it's giving
Than don't rip the ribbon and tip your glass as if this is living
Demand more, let them know you won't stand for it
We gonna have to change if there's no fans for it
This could be holy ground, Hip-hop is holy now
Long as I got the microphone I'm a hold it down
But when I pass the mic back it's back to you know what
But we don't recommend you listen I mean you know us

It aint nothing like Hip-hop music
It aint nothing like, it aint nothing like
It aint nothing like Hip-hop music
It's not wrong or right it's how you use it fam

First you buy the CD, then you buy into
What they saying ain't you tired of them lying to you
It's like false advertisement
They show you guys with whips and chicks but have you ever tried it
You never find love in a one night stand
That's like trying to use a flash light for sunlight tans but
It's not enough light
You probably cried nuff nights with the pain inside bottled up tight
But we, come to release the pressure and weight
Of sin and pull you out like measuring tape
You can, move your body like a snake if you wanna
Then turn around be hollering rape in the corner
I'm not hating on ya, I'm showing love
The kind of love to get you aint gotta go to the club and young
Brothers you aint gotta grow to be thugs rolling on dubbs
What I'm saying is totally bugged
I know this because unless I say I'm holding a snub
Going to pop slugs at homie you don't even budge but
It aint even gotta be like that
I spit life on the mic Christ set me free like that
But, this is holy ground, Hip-hop is holy now
Long as I got the microphone I'm a hold it down
But when I pass the mic back it's back to you know what
But we don't recommend you listen I mean you know us
