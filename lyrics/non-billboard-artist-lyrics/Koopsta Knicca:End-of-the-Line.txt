I've gots to do all my time
Step one
I'm goin through so much stress
Get it out my head, two
Repent all my fuckin sins
But what my chance? Three
I violate my steeper wrong
For blowin smoke
Once it up my nose
But the Devil tryin'a steal my soul, oh no
Say, is it the worsest this shit is gonna get? Oh yeah
I'm tired of this runnin, can't get no fuckin rest, the bed
Is where I'm supposed to lay my head
But his heads whippin eggs
Won't you take me from this darkness
Tryin'a catch me is like a world-wide party
Full of masked-murderers as worse as Bin Laden
Drugged cause I'm mad, plus I'm gone and I'm sick
I was raised by the government, as a cold Satanist
Age sixteen, I sold my soul to the Devil
And in return, he gave me fame, fortune, pleasure
Gave it back to God, now I'm down in a ditch
'For I started this shit, tooken by Triple-Six
Hahahaha
I gave you life, fame, fortune, women, pleasure!
A contract's a contract, you fucking fool!
Look at you now, you must want a fucking god, that won't give you shit!
You're through, Paul, Juicy, Lord, Crunchy and even Boo!
They shall suscede, and watch you fall, which the way you came
No one is to blame, fuck it
You see what you're going through
No fucking friends!
You god-damn punk!
Fuck a Koopsta Knicca man!
It's O.V.!
What the fuck you gonna do now man!?
It's O.V.! (It's O.V.!)
