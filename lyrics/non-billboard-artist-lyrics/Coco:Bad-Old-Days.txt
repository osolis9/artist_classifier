Bad-Old-Days:Coco
Remember me?
I was tossed and turnin' like a ship without a sea
I was lost for learnin' like a song without a key
Remember when
I was all alone without a soul to call my friend?
Who'd have thought those days would ever end?
Those were the bad old days
Before I had your love to guide me
Sad old days
You set me free from all those bad old days
You put all the good inside of me
Those were the bad old days
Before I had you there besides me
Sad old days
And can't you see? - you took the bad old days
And you put all the good inside of me
Remember who
Walked into my life and put their foot inside my shoe
Now what was just a place for one is home for two
Remember why
I'm gonna stay with you until the day I die
We can watch the good old days go by
Those were the bad old days
Before I had your love to guide me
Sad old days
You set me free from all those bad old days
You put all the good inside of me
Oh dooby-doo...
Dooby-dooby-dooby-doo...
Aah...
Those were the bad old days
Before I had you there beside me
Sad old days
And can't you see you took the bad old days
And you put all the good inside of me?
(Those were the bad old days)
(Those were the bad old days)
You put all the good inside of me
(Those were the bad old days)
Ah...
(Those were the bad old days)
You put all the good inside of me
