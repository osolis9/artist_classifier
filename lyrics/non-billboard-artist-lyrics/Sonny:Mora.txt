Mora:Sonny
Take a step off of that silver bird
From your planet
And you brought a little bit of that cold with you
Now wring me out like you would your bastarding father
And you're so quick to stick to that scum,
Hungry like a piranha... ohh

Swallow a little of that sea
Now taste a little bit of the salt in me
Throw up a little of it on your knees
Now doesn't it bring you back to the beginning

Before you poured
Your elements away? (away)
Now sink back to the bottom of it all

You can eat shit and DIE...

Seal your lips with the black stitch of a secret
Parade with that speechless dryness of the desert air
Lay flat under the limelight, and feed off all the fiction
Cold callous and boiled between the bleak deep of your dirty hands

Kiss your son
(Come kiss your son)
Now kiss your Bible
(Kiss your Bible)
No one ever wanted to see your screams
Oh I just won't believe it...

Swallow a little of that sea
Now taste a little bit of that salt in me
Throw up a little of it on your knees
Now doesn't it bring you back to the beginning

Before you poured
Your elements away? (away)
Now sink back to the bottom of it all

You're sinking
You're sinking...

Swallow a little of that sea
Now taste a little bit of that salt in me
Throw up a little of it on your knees
Now doesn't it bring you back to the beginning...
(bring you back to the beginning)

Before you poured
Your elements away? (away)
Now sink back to the bottom of it all...!

(Swallow a little of that sea)
(Throw up a little of it on your knees)
(Now doesn't it bring you back to the beginning)
(Back to the beginning...)

Before you poured
Your elements away
Now sink back to the bottom of it all...
