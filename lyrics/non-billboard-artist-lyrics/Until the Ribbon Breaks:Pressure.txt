Pressure:Until the Ribbon Breaks
I've been knee deep in trouble
Tryin' to stay afloat, pressure, pressure
Noose â€˜round the throat
Quick storm coming, you better stay indoors
Secrets, secrets, buried in the floor
Oh baby wants a new life, it's what you might get
Pressure, pressure, a noose on my neck
Send me down the rope, I start to see
Trouble now coming, coming for me
Maybe in another life, if we get another life
Maybe in that life, I could learn, to love you
Maybe in another time, if there is another time
Maybe in that time, I could learn to love you
There's a riot in the town, a wolf at the door
Pressure, pressure, poison at the core
Quick storm coming, god save the queen
Wake up from your dreams
There's a riot in the town, smoke in your lungs
Pressure, pressure blocking out the son
Send me down a rope, I start to see
Trouble now coming, coming for me
Maybe in another life, if we get another life
Maybe in that life, I could learn, to love you
Maybe in another time, if there is another time
Maybe in that time, I could learn to love you
Maybe in another life, if we get another life
Maybe in that life, I could learn, to love you
Maybe in another time, if there is another time
Maybe in that time, I could learn to love you
