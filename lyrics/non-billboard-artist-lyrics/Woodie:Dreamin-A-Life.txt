Dreamin-A-Life:Woodie
Dreamin a life dreamin a life
Where the money ain't tight

For my... click to succeed how many soldiers must bleed?
We just wanna live comfortable spread our seed and carry on our breed
Each of us need... an old school indeed
Candy paint, drop-top, gold thangs call it greed
So it be, we also want a Benz 500 se laced with chrome
S.u.v for the family, 7 bedroom 4 bath home
Floors made out of marble stone, swimmin' pool with a waterfall
Record company checks pay the bills nobody's gotta ball
Plus we'll take a dime from every dollar that we make so
We can pack and stack up more artillery than waco
Ain't no fits like the ones we got
I'm talkin' dickies and cortez in colors they don't stock
And every homie got a pit bull, refrigerator packed full
Plus a bar with every liquor imaginable
Snoop would be out of the hole back with his folkz livin' the finer ways
With hand painted portraits of dead homiez above the fire place
We won't let money change us but still beware of strangers
Remainin' soldiers, streets have showed us jealous men are dangerous
Right now a 4 car garage is just a mirage
But just the thought of such a life keeps me strugglin' for the cause

Dreamin a life
Where the money ain't tight
And every ride's dipped in candy
Triple gold reflections shine bright
We all got a house on a hill
Everybody got a crop of the kill
As we smoke, drink, kick back and chill
We divide up another million dollar bills

Can we?... hop on a flight... and touch down in Tahiti
Or even the Caribbean, Hawaii or Fiji
Just make it tropical with lots of blue water and white sand
We wanna be greeted by native beauties when the flight lands
Check into a five star hotel, rent the top floor
With ocean views to die for, no thoughts about what cost more
We'll meet down on the beach homeboyz throw your cut off cacks on
There's hundreds of notches in bikinis to get your mack on
Then we'll slide on up to some bar they call the island hut
Sittin' on the oceanfront roll a blunt and light it up
Order up margaritas, coconut coolers with tequila
Appetizers to feed us topped off with lobster fajitas
Now that would be the... life, my angers at ease
You can hear the ocean breeze blowin' through the palm trees
As the sun sinks slowly and the stars ignite
Bikini models talkin' about let's rendezvous tonight
Who would believe? we outlaws had a trick up our sleeve
That would allow us to live and enjoy life's luxuries
We started in the streets gutter bound puttin' in work prepared for jail
And ya'll just got broke off a piece of a Nortenos fairytale
