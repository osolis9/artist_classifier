The-Incredible-Walk:Phanatik
Believe me when I tell you this
The world is wicked there's no telling what they'll do next
But I don't even have to focus on the evil without
I got enough reasonable doubt within me to send me to the chair
That's clear if I stare looking at a crooked cat in the mirror
Who me?
Truly, the enemy is the inner me nothing but me in the vicinity squared
That's two isn't it?
I don't know how to configure it
Or what digit to hit to make the equation equivalent
All I know is there's a war going on
And my sinful nature seems to be the source of it all
If I could get rid of it I'd be further along
And I wouldn't be standing here singing the words of this song
And it goes, what I don't want to do
I do, I pursue what I shouldn't if I could I sue who?
This other me loves me to the death
And would literally die just to satisfy my flesh
It takes every breath and blessing that God gives
Just to use it as a weapon against Him
Takes every good and perfect gift that comes from above
And perverts it like love gets changed for lust
It's dangerous like taking gusts of angel dust
When God displays disgust cause we reject His ways even though His ways are just
I'm stuck with a old nature that's corrupt
And plus incapable of pleasing God believe I tried and succeeded not but
Then Jesus died and rose again
He clothes us in a new nature so the old one won't win
Now I'm opposing sin and natural whims but that's when this battle begins

[Chorus]
There's a war going on, sure you're right
Sure you're wrong, who said that?
You, dead that you're strong but God is stronger
Lord help me conquer this monster
The Incredible Walk

If you look from the outside in
Through skin you'll meet the me that was born in sin but
If you go from the inside out
You'll meet the new me born again about ten years ago
Ten years to grow and here we go in stereo
Got, two inputs right and left
Asking are you down for life or death
Check, this new me is truly weird
It trusts God where I used to be scared, and I'm like
What's that all about
Walking out faith when I thought I had a cause to doubt
I'm telling y'all it's a trip
Now I'm getting equipped, to rep the God of the biblical scriptures
Motivated by a visual clip of the life of Christ and the Cross is the
pivotal picture
Like an old film digitally fixed up
The image is so vivid digits register on the Richter
So now even if it takes a while
I'm only trying to see what's gonna make God smile
In contrast to the me of times past
Quick and illegitimate willing to commit a crime fast
Now I serve the Lord with zeal
And stay sobered up and soldiered up cause the war is real
Not fighting with a sword of steal
But slicing with a spiritual sword that sure to peel
Soul from spirit and flesh from bone
And I roll with the Spirit never, left alone
Plus, my click is more consistent than the metronome
When it comes to letting Christ set the tone
so daily my sinful side is outlined in legible chalk
Letting my new insides outside it's The Incredible Walk
