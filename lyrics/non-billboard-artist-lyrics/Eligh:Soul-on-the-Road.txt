Soul-on-the-Road:Eligh
So much to do and not enough time
Age is but a number but I ponder my demise
Only 30 years old as my finger take a ride
Grippin on my pen, I got what's hangin out the side
Of my art that I was [?] in by feelings in my chest
My heartbeat is my guide
I take what I need and bleed the rest
Yes, Eligh my title is vital I'm on a quest
Yes, one more recital recited for all my guests, yes
I don't know what you've been told
Everyone is getting old
Except me man, except me, except me!
Can't you see I'm on the road
My soul got places to go
So many young folk lost on this Earth
Walking over glass leavin blood in the dirt
Don't wanna finish school, rather smoke than work
That was me ditching class, gettin B's too come to
Turf I never should've been on
I was fuckin over friends
But if I had it back I'd probably do it all again
Cause if I had the facts I'd still be thinking with my sins
A time when she could never fix my age, I was a kid
Nope, doing dumb shit always on my plate I had a grin
Nope, in the hallways lookin for somewhere to hide again
Yup, the nightmare still hits me that I got to get to class
My teacher cared too much so I knew she would kick my ass
Right back into the past, I write to get reprieve
And now I tell the truth so all my people can believe
That they can make it too in any dream in any league
Like Pac said, "fuck enemies and ride on to the [?]"
