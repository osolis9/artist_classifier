Way-To-Early:Colt Ford
You said you gotta go, go ahead, girl,
Go ahead and break my heart.
Oh, I know you gotta leave,
You probably should before we take this thing too far.
But I’d been having such a good time,
Girl, I know I need to get you back.
But when you’re having such a good time
It’s kind of easy to get on track.

Somehow the rain comes way too early,
Somehow “it’s over” comes way too soon,
‘cause it feels like we just got here,
I sure hate to waste the big all movie
At all these stars, you in my arms is right where you’re supposed to be.
Sometimes rain comes way too early for me.

So climb over here, slow down over over here next to me,
Now you gotta get closer, I get alone so with you all the way across the sea.
No we’re pulling off the driveway, I see the headlights in your house.
Girl, I miss you, already, and you ain’t even got out.

Somehow the rain comes way too early,
Somehow “it’s over” comes way too soon,
‘cause it feels like we just got here,
I sure hate to waste the big all movie
At all these stars, you in my arms is right where you’re supposed to be.
Sometimes rain comes way too early for me.

Missing good night, sure it’s taught,
And one more kiss just ain’t enough

Somehow the rain comes way too early,
Somehow “it’s over” comes way too soon,
‘cause it feels like we just got here,
I sure hate to waste the big all movie
At all these stars, you in my arms is right where you’re supposed to be.
Sometimes rain comes way too early for me.
Way too early for me.
Way too early for me.
