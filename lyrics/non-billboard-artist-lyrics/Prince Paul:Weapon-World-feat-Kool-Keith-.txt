Weapon-World-feat-Kool-Keith-:Prince Paul
Infinite infantries, space techs with navi clips
Skin penetration, directions, information
Roll up your knuckles, get blast in your fingertips
Phasers with macs and handles clamped up on your hips

Infrared beams so sharp crease your pant seams
With chestic barrels, I sold them at the Christmas carols
With small scopes from miles adjust them to your house
With see through glocks, that's natural, you know it rocks

Front vinyl holsters some acid pellets from the box
Big tanks sash German Spanish thoughts I be servin'
More beggars in trucks, shippin' weight to Las Vegas
Bicentennial bombs with leather straps for your arms
Garments and bags from hefty, I'm a lefty

Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
You're welcome

Nuke 'em headbands for light blue German Lugars
Forcefields protect, razor bumps behind your neck
Automatics from seven chambers eighty-two bullets
When you pull it, the little twenty five sound like Ganas

Machine guns, electric cords rob the power run
Remington A-70 for the pedigree
Night time militant mask, fueled with laser gas
Atomic ACP thirty round American slugs
With bugs undefeatable navy systems

Brown pearls, pistols with FBI whistles
Suitcase with missiles stashed with toilet tissues
Triggers with frames or 44 that shoot flames
Law enforcement, I got the first kill endorsement

Uzis material eatin' Cocoa Puff cereal
Close range spokers, infrareds let you notice
Factory parts here screws with the custom parts
Deputy badges, fake SWAT teams closin' gasses
Blow up your asses, over here put on masses

Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
You're welcome

Antagonist columnist, astrotech abuser
85 rounds of dynamite sticks with mix
On old rifles and little derringers that fix
LAPD can't see me, I work with Muslim beanie

Indian transporter, machine guns across the border
And Siberian bolts bullet proof winter coats
Across the region, duffel bags of the Station wagons with desert eagles to stop a dragon

Elephant darts with propane travel through the rain
Bust back the right machine to counteract
Carbine 31 shot wake up the project block
Neighborhood with wood, blast off the D off the hood

Bounty hunters with camouflage green alligators
Straight from the Barbados, tourin' sweet potatoes
Can make and pass port way hand grenades that I bought

Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
That's right

Has the effect to put a six foot gorilla
With the skin of an alligator, aluminum
With the aluminum skin of an alligator
To a 4 point 8 Pterodactyl
That's a Dragon Plus with a twist
