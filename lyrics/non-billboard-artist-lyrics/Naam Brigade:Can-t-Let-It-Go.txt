Can-t-Let-It-Go:Naam Brigade
I can see your shadow layin' in the moonlight
I can feel your heart beat playin' on my right side
Every night I long for this, makin' up what I miss
I can hear you breathin', lettin' out a sad sigh
You try so hard, to hide your scars
Always on your guard

Don't, don't let me go
Don't make me hold on
When you're not
Don't, don't turn away
What can I say
So you won't
No don't, don't let me go

I can see the skyline fadin' in the distance
Tears are comin' down and I'm tryin' just to make sense
I don't listen to the radio, just the engine and the road
I wonder if my words are makin' any difference
I dream and then it seems to end
But always comes again

Don't, don't let me go
Don't make me hold on
When you're not
Don't, don't turn away
What can I say
So you won't
No don't, don't let me go

I'm comin' down to where you're standin'
I need you now
Or you'll be watchin' me hit the ground
With a crash landin'

Don't, don't let me go
Don't make me hold on
When you're not
Don't, don't turn away
What can I say
So you won't
No don't, don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
