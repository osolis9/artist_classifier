Cyphers:Tunnel Rats
[Verse 1:]
Watch the clock, cause your timing's off
I'm in the mood to set it, never stop
I'ma tic and toc until your hands regret it
60 seconds come and go, still i'ma take another minute
To count every beat that strikes your heart until you've had your limit
Sound the alarm, if you're thinkin that it's your hour to shine
I'll be quick to tell you're early, it's only a quarter past mine
I'ma adjust your spine, and repair your mind state
Cause your 15 in the sun has now been moved to a later date
There's no wait for 2nd place, if youll just move at faster pace
You'should've known that tunnel rats'll always win at mic debates
Cause we make it a point to be on point
With every rhyme, if you can't see who you've messed with boy
You must've been blind, I'm that sista from new breed
The one who won't concede, i'll rock it to death until the microphone cord bleed
No need to come after me, you're never going to get it
So come on and come with it, baby you gotta learn to spit

[Hook:]
It's a hot style, radio hostile is we
Gospel emcee who ride a thousand miles of beats
Exhale then excel past all expectations
Any cypha any nation [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Apologetics in syphas
Move energy from potential to kinetic in syphas To poetic in cyphas
They don't let us in cyphas
In about four states, Cuz no ones bold enough to bus after we let off in cyphas
Kapueria in cyphas B-boy stance in cyphas
B-boy dance in syphas To advance for your cyphas
Lift your hands in cyphas to show your support
Not for me but him whose report
You believe I designed the flyas Y'all passed out in the syphas
Illest graff for the writas and somethin' for old timas
Phat beats for the minas To rotate over syphas
I'm mo wild out and pray the prayer of faith in a syphas
Creed can't take you higher, Christ fuels the fire
Who do you admire? Make sure they ain't a liar
Cause I'm no expose and be the light of the cyphas
Explode to supernov' don't let me enter your cyphas

[Hook:]
It's a hot style, radio hostile is we
Gospel emcee who ride a thousand miles of beats
Exhale then excel past all expectations
Any cypha any nation [x2]

[Verse 3:]
(Said it)Ritualistic, sometimes it's sadistic
But still I'm quick to pick out your flaws
Caught, panic, raise havoc like they my kids
And love while I teach 'em how to get paid in this biz
By definition I define it, I was born to bruise
As hard as a steel plate and I hate it when I lose
I choose to absorb the pain and hold it inside
And explode and affect anyone that's in my range
And I know you thought it strange that I hope I never change
I been the same since I started this game
See I gave y'all the rope you hangin' yourself with
You want borrowed time and I want payment in full
God said it, I aggressively go and get it
You can't get mad at me I'm nothin' more than a tool
That you can use in a duel like a sword
Someone said those who call me a fool better guard their head
I'm comin' like a whirlwind ...
I stay old school while y'all searchin' for the next
Rooted in the original text
While you dirtied my rep and while you peacefully slept
I took a step toward the finish line without being invited
