Mary-Go-Round:South Park Mexican
Yo-yo homeboy, pass me dat
Yo, this is the song I wrote for the girl I love
Her name, Mary Jane

Saggin' my dickies, smoke like a hippie
Smell so good when she gets wet and sticky
You left me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong

A bong, a blunt or a paper square
It really don't matter, she'll take you there
You been my gal since the age of 13
And it's funny to me, you still make me feel

You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain

You been true to me, stood by my side
I wake up and get my mornings first high
Other hoes wonder why they get no love
'Cause Mary got a big ol' butt, huh

Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh, let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet
Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh, let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet

If you's a Jane user throw your hands in the air
With this muthafuckin' three time loser
Producer, wanna cool my future,
Pass the madusa, I never knews her

Who ya, who ya think ya are?
Ya fuckin' with a dope house shootin' star

Smokin' that budda, drinkin' that budda
Booya, another killa from Madulas
I thug in rida chick gets me higher
There's no needa tryna find a finer hyna
I decaya, my bitch on faya
Be bestet as we kids under playa

Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh, let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet
Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh, let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet

Now you can do snow or get wet as the rain
Me man, I got Jane in my brain
Of course I kick doors for white horse
But my wife Mary-Jane, I never get divorced

'Cause she be tha only one fit for a playa
The green eyes and the pretty red hair
The hoes sick 'cause them jealous bitches wanna
Baila coma Juana la Maria Juana

You was born in Mexico but I took the chance
And brought your ass across to the promise lands
I love to lay you down so soft in my swisha
Act like a freak and let all my niggaz hit ya

I got your picture on all my walls
Mama caught us kissin', wanna call the laws
My family thinks you nothin' but trouble
Can't see how you helped me through the struggle

Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh, let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet
Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh, let the mary-go-round, pass the sweet
