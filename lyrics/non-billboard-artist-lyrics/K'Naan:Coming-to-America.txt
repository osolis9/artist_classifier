Coming-to-America:K'Naan
I came out of a killer, neighborhood called River
Where life expectancy is shorter than a caterpillar
I was once a gorilla, and this show was my cage
My trina was the gauge, Ak was my baby sitter
When we be out and looted, the whole city was shooting
I know it's fucked up but somehow, this army came shooting
Niggas heard African rappers and thought about them voodoo
It's superman, tell the real soldier boy come to shoot you
Same food and of course what you... nigga
Fuck what you heard, yeah nigga
Come walk in the dark no fear nigga
It's a ... my eyes no tears nigga
Working malaria, your hood can't even compare here
Got keys, they really love barriers
Come ... here, I'm daring you
I'll shoot your ... ain't afraid like give me a ...lemonade
You up my school... while playing catch with a hand grenade
Yeap, that's a true story, this ain't Hollywood glory
I ain't the prince of the ... my life is too ...

I'm tired of always going through barriers
I just wanna live a good life
So I'm coming, coming to America,
I hope we gonna have a good time
Baby thanks for letting me marry ya
... car sure looks fine
So I'm coming, coming to America,
I hope we gonna have a good time

Now my second home city, what can I say
It took my fucking heart from me
I played the judge part and i...
Oh yeah, that mean it never got no bars for me
See that ... to the motherfucker... be
Fuck puck but it ain't no hockey
When the cops came, they knocked me
I had to flee, they said to bargain, I had to pee
So I crossed the border while they put a warrant out for me

I'm tired of always going through barriers
I just wanna live a good life
So I'm coming, coming to America,
I hope we gonna have a good time
Baby thanks for letting me marry ya
... car sure looks fine
So I'm coming, coming to America,
I hope we gonna have a good time

I know, everywhere in the world, got his problems
Everybody got the dreams, of the greens, of the dollars
But some of us are dying in the streets can you figure out
Even in America, the... need a ticket out
