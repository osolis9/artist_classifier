When you update answer quick
When you done they got to broke your phone
Some shit you just can't forget
When you coming from a broken home
With one mom,no dad
Two sisters going through it, 
Smile long, pretend you good
But you really hurtin' and no one knew it
School,class, I knew it was something it wouldn't last
'Cause I didn't need a lecture to pass 
And me making beats would never require math
I knew what I wanted before I had it
But I always had it I was an addict
And this room is filling just like an attic
Making 10 beats a day and going at it
Well my ex-girl telling me she missed her cycle
Felt like I got shot with a pistol rifle
Gaze,wish we was on the same page
But she don't understand I wanna be like Michael
But not upon no hoe shit
Yeah I used to be up on the hoe shit
'Til I realised I wasn't tall enough
And then I jumped in to the music
Got with a couple niggers I was killed it
T'd up tryin' to make a movement
Had the same drive,same passion
I never thought that we would ever lose it
And we can never get back right
What it was done in a dark deed hit that light
Tears in your eyes can't forget that night
Then you stab me in that back I wish I hid that knife
But it didn't stop me though
Holla at the moon like a raddy dog
He said that he be through the same shit
And the real ties you make could not be broke
So I went back to my place
And I logged into Myspace
Heard a couple beats from a nigger from New Orleans
I'm thinking to myself ,man this guy's great
Then we build a brand,right from home
Move to the A,join the zone 
Learned alot,moved alone
Next thing I knew I was back at home
Now I gotta focus on me
'Cause shit got a little bit shifty
Bills got a little too deep
I'm on eye shot hollaring at Ricky
While he sitting at sessions with kids
Telling me that I could be the next D
Telling me that he believed in my dreams
It's all a matter of time,indefinitely
Keep working,hits gonna get you to the start up
Next thing I know it's Christmas in Harlem
While after that I'm working in the palace
Overseas weeks they went over like Alice
God damn I was just at home
Now I'm nr.3 on the throne
I got so many emotions that I had to make it into a song
This is what you're getting after
Read the index skip the chapter
Either way you will see me get globe
I wanna welcome y'all to Hit story
