Ghetto-Sermon:Gospel Gangstas
My dog slipped the pistol grip Blasted.
Caught him in his back and now I’m rappin in front a his casket.
Now you can't Trust this world. This world is cold. My word is good as gold.
Homies claim they homies, but they phonies cuz they Fold. Now as its told,
Stroll with me down another life, hold on tight,
Cuz yo brightest day is your darkest night. Look to the light. 
As you see em [coming to] pursue you.
They was pointin like they knew you. They just jackers tryin to do you.
Wait a minute, let you grab your Get-Em-Up-Off-Me.
Cuz aint no killin you softly 
You peep they deep, 
So now you gotta Reach when you put em to Sleep.
You pours out proof for yo deceased, and wish your enemies rest in grief 
That took your Homie's life away from him like a thief.
I've been in, if not worse, the same places. 
I conversate with killers on a first name basis.
I be like, What up, Mike? What up, Shawn? What's happening, John?
I be like, What’s happening Chef? and What’s up, Ron?
SATAN, don’t get yourself caught up in this game.
Cuz this game will give you a number and snatch away your name.
But the world keeps turnin.
And im on keep preachin and O Double G’s is deacons at this GHETTO SERMON.
