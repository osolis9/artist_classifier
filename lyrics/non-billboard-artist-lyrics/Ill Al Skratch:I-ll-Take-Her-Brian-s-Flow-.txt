I-ll-Take-Her-Brian-s-Flow-:Ill Al Skratch
Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?

Hoh!
Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?
I'll take her
Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?
Hoh!
Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?
I'll take her
Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?
Oh oh yeah

Yeah, it's Al Skratch, that real smooth brother
The undercover lover makin' moves on your mother
If I have to, it's only natural, that I rap to
Any girl walkin' through my hood if she's lookin' good
And if she's somethin' fine, I'll be humpin' hind
Let's get it on, ain't nuthin' wrong, with a little 'Bump N Grind'

Now that's what my man say
Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of bein' hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the homiez
But now I must remember all about my tenderonis

You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin'
You in the mood for some sexual healin'
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin'
Starin', but not carin', about, what you wearin'

You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone
Whether you're single we can mingle as you jingle
Swing low, with the black Mandingo
I be the dough money-maker rump-shaker
To the bedroom I said, "Hmm, I'll take her"

If you don't want her don't waste her time
(Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?)
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
(Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?)
 (Don't waste her time, don't waste no time)

Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
(Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?)
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
I'll take her, I'll take her

Yeah, well it's Big Ill, silly me, I puff the Phillie G
I make your body move, get smooth like Billy Dee
Get you hopin', make you beg for the third leg twice
'Cause I make it funky like my name was Greg Nice

Hit you off, then I'm ghost somethin' proper like
Two things I never do. fall in love or drop a MIC
I'm Big Ill, now you know my style I'm glad you came
I give your man a pound, then I ask you what's your name

Sign a autograph, then I step with my staff
To the hotel, hope everything goes swell
That's what you say as I sway on my way to my room
Crazy deep, don't sleep I keep the poom poom

Jockin' clockin', knockin' out the box when, I perform
That's why the girlies they swarm to see Big Ill
Later on that night at the arena
I seen her, tryin' to get backstage between the

Niggaz I was wit and the security, she didn't
Lookin' from a distance I see her booty's hittin'
Stagger to the barricade and bag her as I grab her
Thinkin' to myself, "Aiyyo, I got to have her"

If you don't want her don't waste her time
(Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?)
If you don't want her don't waste her time
(Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?)

I'll take her, I'll take her, take her, take her, take her
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?
On my knees, ohh yeah

Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
Oh yeah, I'll take her, take her, take her, take her
If you don't want her don't waste her time
Bring it here to me, yeah
Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
Ooh, I'll take her

Yeah, yeah I like your flow yo, do I say oh no?
And get it hittin' one on one like a solo
I think not, 'cause it ain't no fun
If my homey Mr. Raspy Skratch can't get none

Hey, I be the one with the voice that's raspy
Al Skratch see, gettin' downright nasty
I pass the, girls in my vicinity
Back to my man Big Ill, he got the remedy
For the

If you don't want her don't waste her time
(Looked her up and down, said,? Hmm I'll take her?)
Ooh baby oh baby
If you don't want her don't waste her time
