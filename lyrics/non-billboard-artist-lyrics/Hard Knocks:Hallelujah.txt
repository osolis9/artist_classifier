Hallelujah:Hard Knocks
I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift.
The baffled king composing Hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

Well you faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.

Well she tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and cut your hair
And from your lips she drew hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really what's it to you?

There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken, Hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you.

And even thought it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked the floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.

But I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Our love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

Maybe there's a god above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.

It's not a cry you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.

Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
