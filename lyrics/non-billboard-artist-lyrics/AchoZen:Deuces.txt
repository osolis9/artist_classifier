Deuces:AchoZen
What's the Achozen?

[Chorus: RZA]
Deuces is wild, this is pitty pat
Two-two, with the triple fat goose
You, you ain't never placed a bigger bet
You, you ain't never seen a bigger threat

[Chorus II: RZA]
Deuces is wild, getting milli' off a bag of illy
Iced out, on the sand like a chilly willy
You, you ain't never placed a bigger bet
Deuces is wild, this a triple threat

[Hook: RZA]
In the world that's been chosen, they come be Achozen
Rising from the dead, over throw the opposing
Forces of evil, controlling our people
Deuces is wild, and the wisdom is lethal

[Shavo Odadjian]
4-22, stomping through, I can see you
Strike a match, like the sun, watch the preview
Life is a game, play war, don't refuse to
Three is the few, and life we are true too

[Chorus]

[Beretta 9]
This is how I'm fully taught, fuck what you really though
Nine milli' pops ya top, silly pop
Like your colon cap, ice like the polar cap
Jar of Israeli drop, so clash and feel me rap
Yo phantom power, my answer will strike the power
The truth is of what you write, and what ya'll recite the power
Is how I spit, my night to this very time, an hour
With just a spec, of light, we shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

[RZA]
What's the Achozen?
What's the Achozen?
Deuces is wild, this is pitty pat
Deuces is wild, this is pitty pat

[Hook]

[RZA]
You a force, I can see right through you
We Achozen, we come here to free you
So you can live in this world like we do
Achozen few from the outclassed people

[Chorus]

[Chorus II]

[Outro: RZA]
Deuces is...
Deuces is...
Deuces is...
Deuces is...
Deuces is...
