People-Change:Logan Lasher
I never thought I'd be in this mess I never thought you'd be so
careless But now I see through your heart I guess it's time I go back
to start The times are changing every day.
And that means I'm the one who pays You
have made me who I am But to you I'm just a scam

It's funny how people change They look you in the face and say "
It's funny how people change But you're the one who is that way"
