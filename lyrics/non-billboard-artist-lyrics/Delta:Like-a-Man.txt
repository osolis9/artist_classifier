Like-a-Man:Delta
There's no time to be fooling around
You just gotta say what's on your mind
And never turn your back don't mind what other say
Hate the feeling of keeping thoughts inside
And pretend that everything's right
And you know
It's untrue
Why don't you tell us what is on your mind?
Can't you feel my anger coming back?
Cause tonight it's the time to decide
Why can't you tell me face to face?
Like a man
Time goes by you're full of regrets
You didn't look right into my eyes so you lied
No turning back
What's done it's done
It's time
Make your mind realize
What makes you feel alive
So tell me the truth that you have found
No visions, prophecies or signs
It's not a matter of luck
Don't let the chance escape
Why don't you tell us what is on your mind?
Can't you feel my anger coming back?
Cause tonight
It's the time
To decide
Why can't you tell me face to face?
Like a man
Time goes by you're full of regrets
You didn't look right into my eyes
So you lied
No turning back
What's done it's done
It's time make your mind
Realize
What makes you feel alive
Why can't you tell me face to face
Like a man
Time goes by you're full of regrets
You didn't look right into my eyes
So you lied
No turning back
What's done it's done
It's time
Make your mind
Realize
What makes you feel!
Why can't you tell me face to face like a man?
Time goes by you're full of regrets
You didn't look right into my eyes
So you lied
No turning back what's done it's done
It's time
Make your mind
Realize
What makes you feel alive feel alive!.
