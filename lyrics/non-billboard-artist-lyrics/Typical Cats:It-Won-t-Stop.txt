It-Won-t-Stop:Typical Cats
[Verse: 1]
These veterans better get ready for severin' and blood sheddin'
Fuck a gun, when I'm finished there's no bodies to place the lead in
Beheadin' the beast with sharp blades
They're so heavy that when they touch you
They crush you before they even get a fuckin' chance to cut you
You ain't fucking with Qwazaar
Vocally slay all with eight bars
The only one hard enough that he can rape God
Verbally take y'all through hell and back
Your scabs are peelin' back
Drain the blood from your skull then heal it back
I'm killin' rap
Scars carved am I gonna have to mark the death count
In a boxing match I snatch your breath out then count the ref out
I thought I warned you, death is upon you
With steel cleats I'm stompin' on you
Ghosts from the past, cats I killed, hunt you
Miniature missiles launch through your chest cavity
I love the smell of your burnt flesh actually
I love the sound of your burnt flesh
Hittin' the ground from the cause of the gravity
I spit concrete reality, it won't stop

[Hook]
Always and forever, Qwazaar, on and on, on and on
Qwazaar, see this shit never stops, always and forever
Qwazaar, on and on, on and on, Qwazaar, it don't stop

[Verse: 2]

It won't stop until I see the coroner closing you up
After pulling the bullet from out of the hole that opened you up
Armageddon in flesh
Manifest and feel the chill from my breath
These punches'll punch through your chest with a fist full of death
Even a death before sedition
The type o' shit that'd convert the four horsemen to Christian
Paganistic worshippin', harsh rippin'
I spill your blood across the altar the four fifth and lift you
If I'm God I ain't gotta explain why I'm comin' to get you
You think we battlin' bitch listen
I'm comin' to kill you
Stick you till the blood spills on cats you brought with you
My blade'll split you
Bringin' them with you was a bad choice
As a matter of fact I blast five nines
You can ask words with telepathic ability
I place thoughts in your mind that's so hard to grasp
That when you try to spit em it's not your voice
The evidence of pain is all over you sir
For whatever it's worth these murderous words'll put Jehovah in dirt
Set it off apocalyptic holocaust off on all of you, brutally awful
You hear the cries from God callin' you

(on and on and it don't quit)

[Outro]

It won't stop until I see the heads feelin' the beat
It won't stop until I see the blood spillin' in streets
It won't stop until I read about who murdered your crew
It won't stop until I see the heads feelin' the beat
It won't stop until I see the blood spillin' in streets
It won't stop until I read about who murdered your crew
It won't stop until I speak these words to you

On and on, It don't stop, on and on and on and on
Always and forever, Qwazaar
See this shit never stops
It don't stop
