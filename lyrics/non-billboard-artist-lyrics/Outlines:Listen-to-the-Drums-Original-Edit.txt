Look into my eyes
See the world I see
Sides(?) of you and me
Together...

Hear into my ears
Get rid of your fears
Listen to the drums
They take us back to where we were

Taste into my tongue
Breathe into my lungs
Please don't put a stop to my endeavor.

Touch into my skin
Feel the love within
I want to be with you
Forever...

I want to be with you
