I got this bad chick up town she was wow
Had me f’d up in the head, I mean wow
I tried to buy her diamonds and pearls
She said wow
But them I’m getting money on the block 
It’s like wow
Now I got the crack up in the sockets like wow
Pull up in the drop and let the top go back like wow
And I’m chilling with a couple women and we wow
And we rolling up a couple swishers getting wow
I mean high, you know me, I’m a fly guy, og
From the block man I used to keep a …
And my … hope it’s on me
… act like you wanna run up..

Act like you wanna pull a gun up on a …
Triggers what we gripping on
Tell me what you mean, what you mean, what you mean
What you spitting on…

And them kilos go, like o for a o
Everybody know I’m like joe with the blow
