Love Song
 feat. Paul Wall

Step into the club(club)
bass beating so loud
boy I see you peeping me through the smoke cloud.
I gotta play it off because im seeing you 
anything you want because im feeling you 
i walk up to you slowly and say baby would you like to get to know me
will you put your hands upon my body
baby dont let go
anything that you want
you can have 
im yours

oh uh come on baby give it to me
just like that boy you know exactly what i need from you
yeah you really turn me on
Boy you make me want to sing you a love song.

The temperatures rising.
you got me hoping that your love is hypmotizing.
to the next level boy with you is where i wanna go.
but if im moving too fast baby just let me know(let me know)
theres something about the way you move that makes me wonder,
how you work it because my sheets are what your under.
Dont stop because i like what you do baby 
give it to me right there you make me wanna say

oh uh come on baby give it to me 
just like that boy you know exactly what i need from you 
yeah you really turn me on 
boy you make me wanna sing you a love song

oh uh come on baby give it to me 
just like that boy you know exactly what i need from you
yeah you really turn me on
boy you make me wanna sing you a love song.
