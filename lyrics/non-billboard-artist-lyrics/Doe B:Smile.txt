For all the ones that hated O I still got love for em
I don't wish nothing bad on em, just got tough love for em
Guess all the love that I was showin, it wasn't enough for em
But I wish you all the best, just gon kill you with success
Cos I know it hurts you nigga eyes when you see me shine
I know you niggas wish you were blind when you see me shine
Man I ain't tryna hurt you, I don't wanna see you dead
I wanna see your family perfect, wanna see you take care of your kids
I wanna see you and you see me pull up in that foreign shit
I wanna see you saluting a kid like don't stay on yo shit
But instead you wannago against this shit,
This is history in the making, I don't wanna see you miss this shit

I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna see you happy
I'm just tryna make you proud
Just wanna hear you say you love me
And I don't wanna see you down
No, I don't wanna see you struggling
I'm just tryna see you smile
I just wanna see you…
I just wanna see you…
I just wanna see you smile

I'mma say this out to my mama who put away all my drama
200 and 52 months, that's 21 summers
I never should attempt, you such a strong one
You went to marry both the whole world, that's why I owe you
And you deserve it even though nobody's perfect
In God eyes is a fully round circle in my eyes
Shit, but I ain't satisfied, see you got that house baby
See you deserve a mansion, hoping the times will change this
Bet you done took and keep a nigga belly full
The flies close on my back, you the reason why I'm so cool
You the reason why where I'm bad
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you
And you know I love you for that, I want for that
