Do Or Die
i let it be known from the jump that this was Christ for life 
He put me on with this life and since we bangin i got to get my stripes 
lay in the cut, with my Bible in front my gut 
and when i jump up, you know the fallen angels duck 
or break and runnin, and as for prisoners im takin none 
im on raise you that rep, now you aint starin down the shakin gun (??) 
im singin demons die, was thinkin for survival trippin (??) 
i binds em up in the Name of Jesus, then i Bible whip em 
so if you wicked make sure you still steppin 
and my Bible might remain a concealed weapon 
see, prayer is how my text spit, my Bible's my next clip 
i worship and praise the G, you step to me and you get checked quick 
see you dealin with a Saved thug 
and when i put on my gloves demons get no love, just mo slugs 
now when the mob, they points the finger at me 
i keep my Bible in my khaki, plus im trigger happy, yeah 
i gangs bang everyday, i cant stay neutral 
cuz satan hate my gut so the feeling stay mutual 
im real with the Son so real is how i come 
i never been a mark, if im a do it then its done 
its Jesus Christ for life, and satan K all day 
and im on represent that rhyme until i flatline 
to all the Christians stay on deck, cuz you and i, 
in 96 we chew or fry, we do or die (??) 
(do or die) 
im do or die, im do or die 
i dont know about you but i, be do or die 
im do or die, im do or die 
either God has got a vault or God aint got it all, gangsta 
repeat
to do or to die, thats my options 
i chose do and i aint stoppin it from the east to the west, its poppin 
clear the way when i come out, wit my gun out 
im committed to the Cross, i wont run out 
id rather be 6 feet deep sleep before retreat 
no defeat, all is obsolete when i pulls heat 
used to be from the set 
used to be down, used to get respect, but check 
day from the 2 to deaf die hard, went to pull thy card (??) 
rather die scarred, oh my Lord 
i got the keys, he gave me these 
get on my knees, been around them Doub-Double Gs (??) 
these homies id ride fo, i cry fo 
and if it came down to it id die fo 
reject Christ, the penalty is death, genius 
and you can tell by my face that i mean this 
im do or die 
repeat chorus 
im do or die, Christ or crack you must learn that 
if i retreat and turn back that means i burn black 
took my Salvation lightly till it occurred to me 
that it was legions of demons tryin to murder me, hurt a G 
a Christian, not a victim to this crime rate 
they set it off now door die is my mind state 
either you gone do his will and step, and die 
cuz the wages of sin is death, aint nothin left 
you cant be goin on like a sucka sayin "God im a trust ya" 
and back out like a busta 
satan knocked and said "Chill, let me in" 
i said "not by the hairs of my Chille Chill chin" 
win, lose, or draw, stand or fall 
cuz either God is got a vault or God aint got it all, gangsta 
its a shame what the media do to a guy 
i told you last album i was do or die 
(do or die) 
im do or die, im do or die 
i dont know about you but i, be do or die 
im do or die, we do or die 
either God has got a vault or God aint got it all, gangsta 
repeat
wsup kid ??

whats up, jay cuz 
all right 
hey, we done crossed enemy lines, loc 
we in too deep now 
no turnin back 
we miss that coil, we do or die 
you do or die ?? 
yeah, im do or die, aint no two litters about it 
couldnt deny it even if we tried it yeah 
they'll never catch me, never capture me 
until Jesus come back and Rapture me 
they cant capture me 
until Jesus comes to Rapture me 
they'll never catch me, never capture me 
until Jesus come back and Rapture me 
they'll never catch me, never capture me 
until Jesus come back and Rapture me 
repeat chorus
