She-Got-That:Slim & Danja
Been around the world,
Seen a lot of girls,
Bad as you wanna be,
Know that I’m a flirt,
Looking like models,
Hot bodies,
Designed in the shape of coke bottles,
I’ve seen a lot of them,
But I don’t know,
Where this on right here came from,
Coz she got what I need,
And she got just what I want,
And it all comes to mind,
Baby you ain’t seen nothing,
Got your boy feeling like dude,

This one is my shawty,
Everybody know,
Never seen a woman like this one before,
Definition of a lady, 
I can’t let her go,
Gotta have her with me,
Coz it’s like that,
Coz she know she got that,
I’ve been all around the world and never seen a girl that,
Got me all up in lock, now because she got that, 
Whoa, whoa, yeah she got that,
Try to leave alone, 
But I can’t, 
I’m coming right back,
Whoa, and now the girls know that I ain’t leaving,
Whoa, everybody know that she the reason,
Whoa, whoa, yeah she got that,
Whoa, whoa, yeah she got that,

Whoa, Shawty is a 10,
Got me runnin back, 
Over and over again, 
She can beat me like the wind,
Trying to control it,
But I lose my mind every time she let me hold it, 
I think she got me falling,
And the pressure still,
Got me feeling gone,
Acting like she appeared,
But I like you appeal,
I don’t wanna change it,
Shawty got me feeling so good I had to name it,
