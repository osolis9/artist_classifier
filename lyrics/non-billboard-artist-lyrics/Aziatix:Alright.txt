Alright:Aziatix
All stress aside, it's my time to shine
I did my 9 to 5, I'm glad that I'm alive
Step into the club, I roll through like I'm the man
Because I am, with the master plan, haters looking at me like damn

They wanna kick dirt up on my name, and crush my life and all its dreams
Yet I feel so fresh, so clean when I step into the scene
Through the smiles and frowns, ups and downs, high and lows
Going all day and all night, perfect timing, man it's so right,
My moment is here, I'll be alright

Feels like there's something trying to tell me,
Everything is gonna be alright, alright, alright
But I can't help but look over my shoulders,
Just to know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright
I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(And I have no privacy)
I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(Tell me is it just a dream)

The stars are out, I'ma take my place
Because I have way more than what it takes
You know the people behind wanna see me break
But from all my mistakes, I'm feeling great
Never will I call it quits, start scratching my head
And be known for the one who flakes
Do the do the 2 step I got moves to make
I'm alright, alright, I'm straight, straight

But I'ma have to keep it real cuz' some things will never change
The same thought that be playing in my brain

Feels like there's something trying to tell me,
Everything is gonna be alright, alright, alright
But I can't help but look over my shoulders,
Just to know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright
I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(And I have no privacy)
I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(Tell me is it just a dream)

I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(And I have no privacy)
I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(Tell me is it just a dream)

Put your hands up
A little higher, higher
Put your hands up
Put em up, put em up, way up in the sky

Feels like there's something trying to tell me,
Everything is gonna be alright, alright, alright
But I can't help but look over my shoulders,
Just to know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright
I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(And I have no privacy)
I always feel like, somebody's watching me
(Tell me is it just a dream)

Put your hands up
