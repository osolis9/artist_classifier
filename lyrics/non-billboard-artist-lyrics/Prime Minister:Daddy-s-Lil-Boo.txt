your daddy no wall of tricks
of the principalities you gonna be fighting with
rule one remember that every gurl hates you
rule two money and fame will try to overtake you
rule three its the simplest G
if you step up in the industry
you gotta keep it ministry
number four its the women with the dibs
pray and ask god to direct you through the right ribs
rule five its the best of all
make it a point to stay away from the drugs and the alcohol
renew your mind daily, ya heard
always start your day when you pray
reading god's word
and thats a man
be a man lil trae
dont never let no false prophets lead you astray
i want your mind to be focused, rooted in the truth
thats why i wrote this for you boo

i see you grown alot
to go ur own
help your dad operate a 7: 4 ministry
learning all the pro's and the con's
now boo, when i leave
imma leave it all to you
so take care of your sisters
tell em how much you love em
and dont forget to show
respect to your mother
now take the keys to the lexus coupe
and the 50 acre mansion i done left to you
but now you should know what to do
with all those platinum
u need that to continue in the ministry G
when im up in heaven, i ain't gonna need none of that
keep the faith, til we meet up again
my best friend til the end
ill be rootin for you then
and when you realize daddy's cheerin for you
