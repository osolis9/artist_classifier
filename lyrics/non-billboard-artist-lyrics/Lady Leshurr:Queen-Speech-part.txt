Queen-Speech-part:Lady Leshurr
Flow's tight like a corset
Your weave smells like cornbread, ugh
I'mma bring it to your doorstep
I'm about to be bigger than your forehead
Your head needs to get sorted
You will get licked down like a Cornette
I ball, swish, all net
So I don't know who you're eyeballing

Cause I ball, I ball like a bald head
I ball, Michael J-J-Jordan
You want beef? Safe, cool then
You got a team? K, call dem
And if you want more, I'mma give you more then
Your man goes down south like Morden

And he opens his mouth like he's yawning

Owwww, he's gorgeous
No lie
I'll be at your neck like a bow tie
I go ham, pork rind
I'm a put the watch to your face cause it's Show time
And I don't need any recognition, I don't need a cosign
Cause if these girls wanna team up then tag her in, clothesline
I make it ding ding ding like a phone line
I make it ring ring ring, that's my phone line
Wait
Hey booooo... if you don't mind!!
Babes are you alright?
Yeah, I'll be back before 9
There's Ros√© in the fridge just pour mine
Cus I'm a give you that slow wine
Meanwhile
The Internet went mad for the freestyle
So now I'm getting bare calls, bare emails
And get your girlfriend boo boo cause she smells (ew)
These females Cha!
No malice
Known in London, known in Manny
Known in New York, known in Cali
Known in Texas and Cincinnati
I walk around, I roam Italy
I give them an eyeful, Paris
Get turned over, folded bally
Trust mi daddy
Back in the day I couldn't trust mi daddy
Jamaicans saying umhmm yeah she bad eee
Hot spice look pon di gyal eee
Your breath smells like batty
I'm gonna buss, won't need a cabby
Don't act like a likkle chicken from Kentucky
You're tryna win a high score on Flappy Bird
Meanwhile I'm trying to win a Grammy, truth
Break it down cause I'mma break the net
If I bust a rhyme it will break your neck
I'm a raise the bar then I'm a raise the bet
Don't chat to me just save your breath
Red dot, bow, Laser Quest
You're lost, you need an A-Z
And she really thinks that she'll pass me
But I ain't gonna let her
