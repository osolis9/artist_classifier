Up-We-Goin:DJ WhooKid
[feat. Giggs & Jeremih]


Listen, listen, let's get to zoning
 When we get to 6, baby won't forget the moment
 You see my 6 is golden
 Come get the potion
 Champagne, come and get the toasting
 Cause when you too... the most in
 ... that's the best emotion
 2 words I get the best of open
 That's enough for boasting
 Babe, I wanna splash you ocean
 That's the motion,
 ... pop the motion
 When I... bitch go and get the dope in
 6... text me a post in
 When it's going off, guess who's about to host it
 Leave I compost it, light up the weed
 Leave I can smoke it

 Up we goin, up we goin
 It's nothing wrong, with rose
 A couple broads,..
 With nothing on
 Up we goin, up we goin
 It's nothing wrong, with rose
 A couple broads,..
 With nothing on

 Got that pillow on the side
 Fight that, fight that pillow on the side
 When I wake up in the morning about the quarter of the night
 Want a chicken, noodle soup, with a... on the side
 So you like the way you like to grab on it
 On the way you move I can imagine it
 Know you tired of getting all the average
 Won't you come and hop upon this magic stick
 Shawty spit fire 6, whoa, whoa
 With my passenger side chick
 Rolling, rolling, rolling, off the best cheese
 Yes indeed, twisting up the recipe
 Baby will you come up in your testing...
 Now I wonder if I can talk it on a lecture

 I ain't trying to hide it, people kinda like it
 I ain't finished yet, people let me finalize it
 Trying to climax, while you trying to climb me yes
 I'm a blow the pussy off, I'm a dynamite
 I'm a tell you right now, I ain't trying to buy...
 When I find the g spot, I'm a traumatize it
 Yeah, yeah, some trying to find it, yes
 It's' the way it turns up, when the party rises

 Up we goin, up we goin
 It's nothing wrong, with rose
 A couple broads,..
 With nothing on
 Up we goin, up we goin
 It's nothing wrong, with rose
 A couple broads,..
 With nothing on
 Uh, whoa.
