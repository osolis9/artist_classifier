What-We-Gonna-Do:Da Band
(Sara & (Trackmasters))
(It's on fire tonight) What we gonna do tonight
(It's on fire tonight) What we get into tonight
What we gonna do tonight (Trackmasters)
What we get into tonight

(Ness)
Uhh, you know what happens when your girl go out
She pop up, a month later up on Girls Gone Wild
Say cheese you on candid camera
In your birthday suit like a go-go dancer
Ain't nothin' funny I ain't Jo Jo dancer, E. Ness
Puff L's like I promote cancer (huh)
And I ain't gotta kick a pick up line, I'm a pimp
So you can kiss where the sun don't shine

(Young City)
I pull up in that platinum buggy
Club hot, actin' lovely
In the spot where it's packed and jumpin'
You can catch me in the cut tryna to wrap the yucky
Sticky-icky stuff holla at ya youngin' (whoop-whoop)
I'm back on it, hit the macks on it
Girls love to touch and put they back on me
I don't wanna be your man
I'm into one night stands
You know, doin' it big and straight bonin' huh

(Chorus + (Sarah))
(Babs Bunny)
It's more room in the V.I.P.,
You can come take a seat by me (What we gonna do tonight)
Get it poppin making a love scene,
Plenty room in the limousine (What we get into tonight)

(Fred)
Baby girl leave it up to me
I wanna bite through your pantie string (What we gonna do tonight)
Cause I got sexy things I wanna do
That'll get you in the mood indeed (What we get into tonight)

(Babs Bunny)
Roll deep to the club my truck is packed
If it ain't enough room lap it up in the back
Circle the block, pull up in the parking lot
We all smell like weed cause we spark a lot
Table reserved, chicks stand up when they see me
Flag down the waiter get an apple martini
All night stuntin' doin' it up
A bunch of Bed-Stuy bitches with big ass butts

(Fred)
Could it be the snake skin with gators
Or the throwback Raiders
Every moment is a Kodak for the world
But tonight I'm no mack
When I'm at ya girl the human spatula, is attached to her
I snatched her up, pulled her real close to the fur
Gave her a, bottle of Cris fuck a plastic cup
Let me know if we gone bump with your sassy self
Cause the Don got ass to touch, holla back

(Chorus + (Sarah)) x2
(Babs Bunny)
It's more room in the V.I.P.
You can come take a seat by me (What we gonna do tonight)
Get it poppin making a love scene
Plenty room in the limousine (What we get into tonight)

(Fred)
Baby girl leave it up to me
I wanna bite through your pantie string (What we gonna do tonight)
Cause I got sexy things I wanna do
That'll get you in the mood indeed (What we get into tonight)
