Out in the streets yo, G'd up, trump tight homie making that dough.
its one of lifes hardest roads.aint nothing too pretty bout walking this road
From this life you see

Ima do what I do but I never forget that Jah always stay true because
Jah never let the street life get the best of me
Him bless me with music to set me free yea yea
big up my friends and family
who was always there to advise me
from the wrong that I want to do sometimes
When the temptation invades my mind
now I look at all the troubles that I left behind
I say thank you jah
true which part me come from
me coulda been an outlaw
me give thanks that Jah save me life
true de amount a things me see weh
get mi spirit well cross
me give thanks that Jah save me life
enough likkle youth me grow with a done pass
me give thanks that Jah save mi life
So when you see me pon di ends a whole a vibes yea
Just to give thanks that Jah save mi life
