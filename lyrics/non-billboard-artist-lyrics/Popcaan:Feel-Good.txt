Feel-Good:Popcaan
Baby meck mi tell you supn
Mi fall inlove when you legs open
Shi seh mi sweeter than a soldier button
Soldier button
And when mi drive out and gone home
Shi a seh shi still taste mi pon her lip
And shi a tell mi shi waan more
After mi just bruise up the whole a her clit

Baby meck mi tell you why mi love you so much
Cause a same way like me you love fk
Anytime mi see you naked a love struck
And mi love when you whine paw mi ckey till it bruk
Shi seh baby nature calling
Wan to come over
Whole night the rain falling
Shi waan fk till a morning
Shi a seh it feel good
Things a head her, things a head her
Things I feel

Shi a seh it feel good
inside her, inside her
Things I feel

Gyal you puy too tight

Take time ride it
You bruise my dk

Shi a seh it feel good
Things a head her, things a head her
Things I feel

Gyal you puy too tight
Take time ride it
Take time ride it
You bruise my dk

Wi fk till wi drop off the a bed pon the ground
After mi ckey done brace pon you tongue
Ride the ckey fast like plane till you come
Till mi done burn mi spliff and empty the magnum
Baby, mi run mi hand in a you hair like comb
A suh mi grab you hair hard
Shi ask why mi a fk her so hard
Mi seh gyal you too earse hard

Slap up you batty jaw
Bend over yah suh fast
You puy clean, suh you get the ckey raw
No bag a mileage you pum-pum nuh regular
Whisper supn ride in a mi ears like pon the cellular
When mi a fk you baby
Is like mi gone pon a vacation
Mi a whine up in a you tight pum-pum
Slowly like a rotation

Shi a seh it feel good
inside her, inside her
Things I feel

Gyal you puy too tight
time ride it
Take time ride it
You bruise my dk

Shi a seh it feel good
Things a head her, things a head her
Things I feel

Gyal you puy too tight
Take time ride it

You bruise my dk

Baby mi in love wid you puy a that fi gwaan
And mi fk you hard when you still have you jeans-string on
The puy fat like seh is a bees sting her
Regular wi buss a one fk in a Hanesly car
Mi know shi good but mi still tell her
If shi go gove weh the puy mi must kill her
Mi know shi vex when mi just tell her
Cause certain things shi seh me a the first tell her

Mi know you love it when mi a choke you
When mi a fk you
When mi steam up the parrot and the uckro
Gyal seh mi crazy, seh Poppy loco

Baby meck mi tell you why mi love you so much
Cause a same way like me you love fk
Anytime mi see you naked a love struck
And mi love when you whine paw mi ckey till it bruk

Shi a seh it feel good

Things I feel

Gyal you puy too tight

Take time ride it
You bruise my dk

Shi a seh it feel good
Things a head her, things a head her
Things I feel

Gyal you puy too tight
Take time ride it
