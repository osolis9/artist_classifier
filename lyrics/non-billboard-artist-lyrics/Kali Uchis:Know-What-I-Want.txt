Know-What-I-Want:Kali Uchis
They say one door open when another door close
I'm prayin' that's that way that it goes
'Cause right when I'm 'bout to turn the door knob
It seem it's all locked up and the key decomposed
Remind me this the life that I chose
Go full speed, I can't read, the signs that say stop
I brush it off and try to act all nonchalant, yeah
I notice everything, I just act like I don't
But I know what I want (I know)
Yeah, I know just what I want (just what)
But I know what I want (I want)
But, I know what I want (Don't tell me cause)
You swear that you're grown
It's 5 in the morning
You won't call or come home
I'm getting really tired of it
All up in my phone, boy leave it alone
And I'm learning, now I know
Should'a left your ass in the friend zone
