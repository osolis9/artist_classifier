A-Lil-Sumething-feat-Artifacts-Raquel-:Hard 2 Obtain
featuring Artifacts Raquel

Verse One: El the Sensai

Take steps on the mission with the H2O addition
Artifacts nigga listen on the track we never slippin
Bust a busta plus him leavin niggaz in my dust
Pack a marker in my tu to hit the path or the bus
Straight from New Jeru it's the nigga MC El
Kick it swell so tell the boys so they be jeal
Hit your ass across the chamber cuz you got a glass jaw
Baby Pah, I get raw, the best you ever saw
Crews get dissed, with my lyrical fitness
I bruise with my News, so be the Eyewitness
I kicked it, to rip this, to be the mag-nificent
Prolific get specific, the groove is mad isn't it
MC El I'm out to the left motherfucker
I got the groovin sound if you wanna get down

Chorus:

I put you down if you wanna get down (4X)

Verse Two: DL

Get down on it
Yo, it's the nigga with some ruffness
Ahh, and then I bust you with some tough...
shit that I kick, when it spills from the grill
Strapped with Artifacts on the track and Raquel
From the Y-O, and you know we gets HIGH-YO
So r-i-i-i-i-iiiight
Don't try to press it kid, you know DL
is not having it, word to life you get stitched
Too bitch to get down, represent and bring in a gun
Pops the trunk if it's beef that make up
Everything is real, I feel what's real
Now a nigga's packin steel and I won't guard my grill
So watch what you say when you come around my way
And if you're scared say you're scared
"But don't be afraid"
Quiet as kept, Strong Isle
I vic em and I stick em
A bitch ass nigga til he bleeds to death
And let the fans donate what's left
of the body, I gotta thank George and Koty
Who rests in the fly where it's live and happening
And niggaz definitely be strapping

Verse Three: Raquel

Still slow, while currents be driftin on a memory
Just to get down from uptown, I'm with whatever goes down
So add it up and count me in
I'm in for the wins fuck a trend light it up and put one in
Spark it up like a rocket, action packed like a Sock-It
Fuck a card I'm pullin motherfuckin pockets
So stand back, be on guard, it's survival
of the fittest and I plan to pull charge
I keep a tight grip on the trigger, chickenhead try to figure
I won't pull the trigger, cuz I'm not a nigga
Aiyyo, it's Raquel from the Y-O
You know we gets high yo
If I said I didn't I don't lie yo
Voice arrest me like me niggaz Black and Vespy
Ain't got no change so don't motherfuckin ask me
Word to life I get biz like a one-step mic check
Raquel kicks the grip on the black tip

Chorus 2X

Verse Four: Tame One

The New Jerusalem hoodlum droppin tunes on niggaz soon
The nappy ass Newark nigga smokin bigger badder boom
Flex Mad like Cobra, I'm the right one like soda
With red eyes, I'm teachin Jedis, like I was Yoda
I'm too daisy crazy with my penis as a bonus
Keep my fro combless sag my pants like I'm homeless
The city of Bricks, from where I get, fuck the rumors
Do damage like a tumor, walk through asses in my Pumas
Dyslexic, I wreck shit, words flip when I read em like
check mic two One Tame redrums all CM's
The Pack Pistol Posse gonna watch me play Chachi
I'm flippin on some ill shit, H2O spot me
Raquel, MC El, Tame Taste and DL
If we do well, no more shorts on the weed sales
I pop the top off, put dumb bitches on knock off
The Notty top pops a darker marker gettin props off

Verse Five: Taste

Yo click click bang bang, bustin niggaz thang thang
Do the locomation as if you was on the A-Train
Too hard to handle with a grip on the handle
Pump squeeze quick to burn a nigga like a candle
dad, so one two, mic check
I ring bells in eardrums from suburbs to projects
Word, you better ask somebody nigga
Bringin it on with Raquel from the wigga, Y-O
Tame, El the Sensai go way back
Like Mockneck and Sergio Vallente
Can't forget Kurious, with the serious
Uptown Mob, to get the job done
Turn a forty flat to the head, Artifacts in
the corner, gettin massive red, off the fat sacks
Straight from the burrows
Play ya like Annie, until tomorrow

Chorus 2X
