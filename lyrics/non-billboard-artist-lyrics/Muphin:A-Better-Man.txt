A-Better-Man:Muphin
Once again Plutonic Lab on the beat
This song is dedicated to my girl and to my brother
Got to say sorry for being such an arsehole all these years
I don't know why I'm the way I am

Let the tides pull me in and wash away the filth
Saturate the pores and clean out all of the guilt
Let the ocean devour the towers that I've built
There ain't a second in the hour where the world remains still
Let me run to the mill and spill the loose change
Make me feel what it means to experience their pain
Let the stains remain as a reminder of the past
Grab a kilo of dirt and throw it all in the bath
So when I get out dirty will feel clean at last
Remain silent when your mate falls flat on his arse
Though you're bursting to laugh, dispersing the past or bringing it near
I'm starting to hear with closed ears
It's all in the echoes of yesteryear
What I'm tryna do here is understand
And make myself a better man, well I could make myself a better man

So take a stab at me for the man that I'm not
Take a grab at me and take all that I've got
Don't get mad at me for the things I've forgot
It really saddens me that I make you feel lost

Who gives a shit about me?
Who gives a shit about me?

I've got beliefs in a bunch of receipts for lessons that have reached
With a bleach on my brain, I feast on the grain of salt
This week's been the same as the rest
Restricted, black listed from the trendsetter's nest
But I don't give a fuck, mum said you can only do your best
But maybe I rest too often, maybe my work ethic's softened
Or maybe I've forgotten how to feel value
And maybe I wanna make secrets so I don't have to tell you
Maybe I wanna help you and show you through the entrance
I could strip back the anger and cross out the avengeance
I could tell you I love you and make sure you knew I meant it
I could quit cigarettes and alcohol and start to bench-press
Save my cash and then I'd get wrecked less
Confess to the fact I'm selfish and too depressed
And that it doesn't feel like I'm doing my best
I'm not doing my best, I'm not doing my best

Who gives a shit about me?
Who gives a shit about me?
She gives a shit about me
He gives a shit about me
Who gives a shit about me?
Who gives a shit about me?
She gives a shit about me
He gives a shit about me
I thank you
