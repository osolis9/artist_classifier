[Chorus:]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need

[Verse:]
Yo, 100 mill and a warm up to do 8 more
Zimmerman and her honor, hope from the 8th floor
I’m not guilty your honor, I need this case solved
Tryna make a hit and get more commas than baseball
A beach house offshore to put my moms in it
Audemars offshore with my nigga’s arms in it
Some air play, not sure if you hear a bomb with it
In NY they think why, like nothing wrong with it
My set blessed, awards, fresh dress of course
Let’s dress, 2 door the SS
Yes yes, I run with the best ex
If I had a field leader she’ll be my next ex
All of yall to put the crown on me
Show the city I’m king and they could count on me
Pour ace for some that had doubt on me
See the face of my son, I know he proud of me

[Chorus:]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need

[Verse:]
To see my brothers and sisters richer than me
Never have to hustle a pitcher give it to me
Someday one’s ice grillin, I’m like nigga it’s me
Same nigga that was cocaine dealing in building 3
No more pain, insane slangs, we had a lot
A damn shame, we can’t change, do that a lot
I need change, G5 plane and grab a yacht
The same chain, Hussein Range that Cali got
The same lane that baby flies Bacardi in
The same mansion Wayne a throw his party in
The world dancing, champagne, who started it?
I need answers, campaign, I’m marketin
For man DC to be free
Gutter to be home, get rid of that PC
A gun will be 5 years and they still a go squeeze heat
Need yall to spray trains, Ramone and Big Street
Come on

[Chorus:]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need

[Verse:]
Better apartments, project floors with carpet
Stainless steel kitchens, marble lobbies to walk in
She a hotie I’m talking, new Ferrari I parked it
All I need is peace, no more bodies in coffins
Blue skies done darken, ground startin to crack
With more water than dolphins, why they startin with crack?
Shit, why I started to trap?
All I needed was God and then I started to rap

[Chorus:]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need

I need
