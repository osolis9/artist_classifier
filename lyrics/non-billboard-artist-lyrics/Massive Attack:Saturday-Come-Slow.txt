Saturday-Come-Slow:Massive Attack
Lost in the magic
From the last time
This town turning
My arrows to desire

Saturday come slow
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Is there nothing there?

In the limestone caves
In the south ways lands
One time in the kingdom
Belief is on the stand

Saturday come slow
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Is there nothing there?

Saturday come slow
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Is there nothing there?
