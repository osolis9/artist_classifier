Don-t-Be-Mad:Frankee
Chorus
dont be mad, cause i set your shit on fire
dont be mad cause your a fucking liar
dont be scared cause I broke the windows out your car
dont be mad, need to be glad that im still fucking with you

never thought that i could be straight up motherfucking crazy
oh yeah its just like that im that chick that will get you back
if you fuck around im a beat you down
im a do what i do best
if your with some chick trying to pull a trick im a cut you off like the rest

aint nothing like a girl in love fucking around with a straight up fool
you see no im not the one, i fuck chicks up for fun and im still not gonna be mad at you

so dont be mad:
Repeat Chorus

listen up real good, yeah boy dont try to play me like im your toy
dont think that you got it like that im in control better watch your back
if you fuck around im gonna tear you down im gonna fill your life with stress
if i catch a hoe coming thru your door she gonna get it just like the rest

aint nothing like a girl in love fucking around with a straight up fool
you see no im not the one, i fuck chicks up for fun and im still not gonna be mad at you

so dont be mad:
Repeat Chorus

im the girl that will stay by your side but fuck around and i will lose my mind
dont you think i wont find out you cant even go that route
why would you even wanna see, a pretty girl get ugly

Repeat Chorus
