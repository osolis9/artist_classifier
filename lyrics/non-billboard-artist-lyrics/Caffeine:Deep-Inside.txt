Deep-Inside:Caffeine
I want you to stay all around me,
deep inside,
deep inside me,
deep inside me,
are you really so concerned on it,
who are you to say,
that you're my friend,
that you're my friend,

I can hear the echoes in my head,
it's like a rumble,
it's like a rumble,
I can see your lips,
I can read your eyes,
I gotta watch you,
I gotta watch you,
you're still so far,
but still so good,
my only friend now,
I want you to stay all around me,
deep inside,
deep inside me,
deep inside me
