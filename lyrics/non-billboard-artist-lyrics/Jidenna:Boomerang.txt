Boomerang:Jidenna
Oooh no no no no
Don't come near me
Oh no, no no

I thought of leaving, I want key
I want it all, I want it all
I wanna live
She wanna leave, she started grieving,
she want the key
she want the key she want the car
She want the crib
I got a bit it might be about that
and my moods might be about that
Somebody pulling me to feel yo yo
Try to leave but I still don't go

Even if I wanted to, I'd come back here
Even if I wanted to, I'd come back 'cause
We just go around and round

Bang, bang Boomerang
Do you love me or hate me now
Bang, bang Boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke
and champagne
I never really cared about it
If you [?]

When you got me feeling like boomerang
When you got me feeling like boomerang
Boomerang
Boomerang
Bomerang, rang

I've got no need to pretend I
I've got no need to pretend I
I've got no need to pretend I
She want the key, she want the car, she want the crib
I got a bit it might be about that
and my moods might be about that
Somebody pulling me to feel yo yo
Try to leave but I still don't go

Even if I wanted to, I'd come back here
Even if I wanted to, I'd come back 'cause
We just go around baby,

Bang, bang Boomerang
Do you love me or hate me now baby
Bang, bang Boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke
and champagne
I never really cared about it
If you [?]

When you got me feeling like boomerang
When you got me feeling like boomerang

Got me feeling like boomerang

Lookin' out of the window, 'bout the things I do
Lookin' out of the window, 'bout the things I do
Thinking 'bout secrets, I got these all new friends
You taught me that I need them
'Cause everything comes back around baby

Bang, bang Boomerang
Do you love me or hate me now baby
Bang, bang Boomerang
I can't believe it all began with a joke

I never really cared about it
