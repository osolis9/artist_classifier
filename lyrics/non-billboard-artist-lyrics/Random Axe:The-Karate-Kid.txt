The-Karate-Kid:Random Axe
[Verse: Sean Price]

Yo! Cowards begin rap with the wackest lines
Smack pyro from ill pack when I black that eye, Rap a ?reza?(razor?)/
The god spit agressive content
Due to my jail time and crack sold on the park bench/
My right hook'll give you a large dent
One inside of your, face for fucking with Clark Kent/
Tss, ill shit, son, what the shottie did
Leg broke - Will Smith son, The Karate Kid/
..Embrace your Satan
Evil is good in my hood when paper chasing/
This is what happened when Jason, took moms to the 'tel and ?get pad-relations?/
..This'll never be mainstream
They make you sell crack, busts gats and blaze green/
Ravishing Ruck Rude, a motherfucking savage who busts tools/
P!!!
