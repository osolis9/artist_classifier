Beggin-original-version-:Madcon
Oooh
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm begging

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out darling

Ridin' high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, cause I had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

So why anytime I bleed, you let me go
Anytime I feed you get me know
Anytime I see you let me know
But I plan and see just let me go

I'm on my knees when I'm (begging)
Cause I don't wanna lose (you)
I got my arms on spread
And I hope that my heart gets fed, matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin'.

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out darling

I need you, (yeah) to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hangin' over me

A broken man
That I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance
To win my soul

Why we chewing, why we chasin'
Why the bottom, why the basement
Why we got good shit don't embrace it
Why the feel for the need to replace me
Your the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint in a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it the away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep open' doors
Keep hoping for that the door is yours
Keep also home, cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out darling

I'm fightin' hard (yeah)
To hold my own (hold my own)
Just can't make it
All alone (all alone)

I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back (now I'm fallin')
I'm just a calm
'bout to fade to black

And I can't come home
You call and I can't come home
You call you can't come home
You call and I can't come home
You call
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out darling
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out darling
