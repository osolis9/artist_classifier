A-Higher-Level:Rise
"On a higher level" - KRS-One 'Higher Level'*

[Verse 1:]
See I go full throttle
And what I say different
So I'm a role/roll model
Like a displayed biscuit
Presence of mind to share these presents of mine 
And while I'm
Settin' these lines there's other things on my mind
It's memorize
Remember Rise?
All you ridin' along
And vibe with me while I'm on
And don't try this at home
Riots will form as I perform
Calm and quiet your storm
You slippin' on the road of life
And your tires are worn
If you
Would have stayed in
Or would have been out
Or if you would have stopped playing
Or you would have pulled out
Or would have 
Turned down the doe
Or earned as you go
Or if you would have finished school
Or you would have went pro
Or would have 
Never dealt cause you knew she was bugged
You would have dealt 
Because you knew what she was capable of
Now people tell me if they was nice then they would be on
And that's right, like if you lived here then you would be home
So just...

[Chorus:]
"It's a business to create" - KRS-One
"On a higher level" - KRS-One 'Higher Level'
"Rise"

[Verse 2:]
As soon as I enta
You just feel a sense of
I don't care what they inta
I'm a genius inventa
This is
For those who started
The flows that they flow
If we all followed then we wouldn't have a lamp or a stove
I'm innovated
Y'all evasive
Do you see what I see?
Like who would have thought all things that a peanut could be?
So it's fate that I relate 
Cause I thought that you thinkin'
When you drinkin'
Cause life's short 
But life's short cause you drinkin'
And battered and bruised
So many blacks are blue
And sky or royal
Where is my home when I was born of foreign soil?
This language ain't mine
I cuss them in theirs
That's why ain't one us learnin'
And they hog all the chairs
Hence, Pence tax and y'all don't represent
We react, when in the course of human events
My people do they time like ?
That translates roughly into "You gon' jet or you gon' die"

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
It's the way we act
It's the way your body moves
Open up your books
This is not a party school
Went to a party school
And started parties too
Got in my party phase
Got back my party rage
I speak with the basics and people impatient
I ain't start
Reachin' and chasin'
And speakin' in Haitian
Who does it better
The king or the host?
Drinks on me
Like the code of the winningest coach
I bar tend, you all trends
And I thought you should know
The only idea for now like reality shows
My feelings spillin' on a page
Little shapes of ink
I sip it, spit it on a stage and find a place to think
Cause on my shoulder there's my destiny right next to the chip
And I'm rubber, you're glue, and you're talkin' shit
It's like a mix show, open mic or whatever
And if you wanna be the truth we'll let you spit accapella

[Repeat Chorus:]
