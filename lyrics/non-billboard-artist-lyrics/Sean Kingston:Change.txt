Change:Sean Kingston
Change, change, change
Change, change, change

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Can someone help me?
(Change the world)
Can somebody help me?
(Change the world)

Everyday I [Incomprehensible] chillin' on the corner
Hustling crack and marijuana
Because I don't have no guidance
Nobody just be guidin', no

Hope to see black people livin' longer
Also less kids without fathers
We should all come together
Please stop fighting and killin' each other

It's what happens when your livin' in the street life
It's so dark and you don't get sunlight
People seein' why you don't get treated right
But I'ma try to change it

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Can someone help me?
(Change the world)
Can somebody help me?
(Change the world)

Many people livin' off welfare
Hopin' things get better next year
But I'm covered in tears
So many sick without health care

Too many innocent people dyin'
And I don't know why
You gotta keep your eyes open
Even when your rollin' as they all stand by

It's what happens when your livin' in the street life
It's so dark and you don't get sunlight
People seein' why you don't get treated right
But I'ma try to change it

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Somebody change the world
We've got little boys and little girls
Growin' up on this sinful earth
Oh what's happening?

I don't know, but please tell me
We've got all these criminals and discretes
Killin' people for no reason
I don't know why

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Oh, I wish I had the power
The power to change the world
But I'm just one man
Tryin' to do it on my own

Can someone help me?
(Change, change, change)
Can somebody help me?
