Wow:The Game 
[feat. Gucci Mane]


My cup, my bitch niggers, everything major
 My niggers they shoot like Indiana Pacers
 Indiana hoosers don't need more about the laser

 Red phantom pink slip, everything paid for
 Black 24's lips fatter than fantasia

 And her name Su Wu, isn't it ironic?

 Respect me like Mohamed, but nigger I'm not Islamic
 On above my profit, ain't you in the cockpit
 Devil when [?] heaven's the only option
 Ain't you on the hood like reverend runs [?]
 The day I'm feeling good riding in his holy ghost
 Hate me like I'm god [?] wanna see you deceased
 Break the 6th commandment if you run upon this Jesus peace

[Chorus:]
 Wow I whip like wow, I whip like gig like [?] ice style

 So love or hate me, it's all gravy
 So icy, so [?] ice cream on my face it ain't your face nigger
 I'm on my grind custom, yeah my grind custom
 While you cross counters, we cross continents
 Yellow diamonds on my wrist looking like a arm [?]

 Power for goons, prepare for you

 And we keep that new pain run when you see them lasers
 We bring them trailblazers smoking kush from the majors
 Still trapping [?]

 Keep clapping, I'm clapping, [?] we takers
 Nigger [?] cellophane
 Get your boss on your phone cause we don't fuck with middle men
 Hit your boss at your home fucking with my middle man
 Where I'm from it's off [?] for just a kilogram

 Must of forgotten them boys you shot nigger murder was the case
 This summer is [?] and a motherfucker safe
 And in a fall, I couldn't [?] mill in a fucking safe

 Wow I whip like wow, I whip like gig like [?] ice style
