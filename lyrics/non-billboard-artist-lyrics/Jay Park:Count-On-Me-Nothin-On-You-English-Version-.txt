Count-On-Me-Nothin-On-You-English-Version-:Jay Park
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi (hi) and I might say hey (hello)
But you shouldn't worry (why) about what they say
Coz they got nothing on you baby (not. not. nothing on you baby,
not. not. nothing on you)
Nothing on you baby (not. not. nothing on you baby,
not. not. nothing on you, Come on!)

The only thing that I
wanted more than your sweet touch
Is the time I get with you, babe
I need you so much
I feeling that Love peace with U
(I feeling that Love peace with U)
I feeling that Love peace with U

So am I
the one that make you feel
The way you make me, babe
Trying to tell you that it's real
There ain't nothing more to say
From this moment our Love peace with U
(From this moment our Love peace with U)
From this moment our Love peace with U

They might say hi (hi) and I might say hey (hello)
But you shouldn't worry (why) about what they say
Coz they got nothing on you baby (not. not. nothing on you baby,
not. not. nothing on you)
Nothing on you baby (not. not. nothing on you baby,
not. not. nothing on you, Come on!)

There's no much nonsense
It's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that we should let it go (let it go)
Cuz we don't wanna be a T.V. episode (episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (let them go, go, go)

No one else of all
There's no one else compares
The way you showed me love
Helps me to chase away my fears
Gotta trust Love peace with U
(Gotta trust Love peace with U)
Gotta trust Love peace with U

So am I
The one that has your love
Coz there's no one else for me
I'm saying we're meant for us
You're the only one I see
Till because of Love peace with U
(Till because of Love peace with U)
Till because of Love peace with U
