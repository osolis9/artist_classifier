Diamond-Gold:Lil' Troy
Yo nigga, we rollin' on the phone
Rollin' mo' scrilla on my primCo phone
I'm like a big fat gorilla with my skizza
Like a muthafuckin' game quizza
I buss a left, a right, I'm muthafuckin' tight
My frosty wrist is worth a mill
Now get down ho and suck on lil' will

We rollin' down the block with intendin' to kill
Put up yo muthafuckin' hands, yo, this shit fo' reel
The Po'Po' be creepin' on the lo' lo'
'Cuz they don't, no, no, I'm the big ass skrilla that be fuckin' yo ho
Now get down on your knees and slop da knob
Don't fuck with this skrilla, I'm the mothafuckin' bomb
And I eat chicken wangs with corn on the cob
