Sleep-When-We-Die:K'Naan
You don't have to launch your missile to break down my defense
You don't need to find a jet to end our arguments
We don't have to be like everyone to use our common sense
So I guess it's time we burned the documents

'Cause you're crazy I'm crazy and there ain't a thing to lose
Except our pride at suicide of all we've ever knew
And somewhere is where east and west and the wall is coming down
Some times we celebrate other times we say what have we done
And I feel you're holding on and I'm holding on too
But no matter what we say or do the wall is coming down
The wall is coming down
Down
I see you come around
'Cause the wall is coming down

I don't have to build a fortress to hide what you can't see
I don't have to be the master and hold on to the key
Sometimes I feel so certain that we were meant to be
But I guess it's fine if you disagree

'Cause I'm crazy and you're crazy and there ain't a thing to lose
Except our pride at suicide of all we've ever knew
And somewhere is where east and west and the wall is coming down
Some times we celebrate other times we say what have we done
And I feel you're holding on and I'm holding on too
But no matter what we say or do the wall is coming down
The wall is coming down
Down
I see you come around
'Cause the wall is coming down

So whenever we turn the wheel peace talking make a deal
You remind me of palace time and I feel so Israel
Look at all the walls I've built and look at all the guards you've killed
And if the gates would open would it be more loving
Or would all my fears turn real
So for now I suppress your demonstration and I undress you here's the question
This love making a masturbation if every touch feels like instigation
I'm so sure if we all trusted the force of love
Even if our past is awful also break our pride in the torso
Whatever it takes for down these walls go

And somewhere is where east and west and the wall is coming down
Some times we celebrate other times we say what have we done
And I feel you're holding on and I'm holding on too
But no matter what we say or do the wall is coming down
The wall is coming down
Down
I see you come around
'Cause the wall is coming down
