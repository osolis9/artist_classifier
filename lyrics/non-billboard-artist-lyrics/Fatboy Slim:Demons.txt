Demons:Fatboy Slim
They say, "She had a heart attack"
I think the preacher's coming back
And I am fried 'cause all my love's electrifying

And I'm comfy like a cesspool, I wanna be with you
And it's my premonition, I better give my heart a listen
And my preacher say

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
'Cause all of my demons have withered away

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
'Cause all of my demons have withered away
All of my demons have withered away

They said he shook himself to death
I wanna dance 'til my last breath
But mister, watch it, only parties hard in [Incomprehensible]

Comfy like a cesspool, wanna be with you, wanna be with you
And it's my premonition, I better give my heart a listen
And my preacher say

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
'Cos all of my demons have withered away

All of your demons will wither away
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay
You'll understand when you come my way
'Cause all of my demons have withered away

All of your demons wither away
All of your demons wither away
All of your demons wither away
All of your demons wither away
All of your demons wither away
Ecstasy comes, cannot stay

I better give my heart a listen
I better give my heart a listen
'Cause the preacher say

All of my demons

All of your demons wither away
Ecstasy comes, cannot stay
You'll understand, come my way
All of my demons wither away

All of your demons wither away
Ecstasy comes, cannot stay
You'll understand, come my way
All of my demons wither away

Ecstasy comes, oh
