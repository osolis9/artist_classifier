Storm-Coming:Gnarls Barkley
I could paint a picture with a pen
But a song will only scratch the skin
And there are still places I haven't been
Because I know what's in there is already in the air

Oh, yeah, there's a storm on the way
There's a storm on the way, alright
There's a storm on the way
And it's comin' no matter what I say
(And I come, I come, I come, I come)

Hey, hey, hey
There's truth in the thunder
Love in the lightning, the feeling is frightening
Yeah, isn't it exciting?

I'm something like stormy weather
If I weren't we would never
Huddle together
Do I have to tell you?

That I'm also the sunlight
That shines shortly after
I just rain 'cause I have to
On to another chapter

I wish you lots of laughter
'Til the next time you see me
Just remember
You need me

I'm the storm coming
(And I come, I come, I come, I come)
Oh, come on, come on
(And I come, I come, I come, I come)
Come on

Run towards the hills to avoid the high flood
I can do a dance that'll make the sky cry blood
Skills provoke, and seals will be broken open
All that's left to do is try my love

When I sing it's a cyclone
I'm writing a raging sea
Searching for a sign of the times
Is it safe to say it's me?

Listen to our lives
The wind will whisper the way it is
I am going to happen
What a lovely day it is

Don't ask why
Just live and die
