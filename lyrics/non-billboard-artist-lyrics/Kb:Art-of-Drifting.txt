Art-of-Drifting:Kb
You don't love the church no more
You don't love the church no more
You don't wanna serve no more
You just love the perks homeboy, yeah
And counting money from your merch homeboy
Ticky, ticky, ticky, ticky, tock
Ticky, ticky, ticky, ticky
And we ain't got time no more
God is not God no more
He is just a job homeboy, oh boy

Where did we get off and where did it all go wrong? (all go wrong)
We stop talking Jesus as soon as the mic is off
I had a dream last night and this is what I saw
You can build a Christian empire without God
Living for the buss, yeah yeah
Breaking out the cups, yeah yeah
Hennessey by the tub, yeah yeah
Loosen up yeah we ain't in the field no more
Just a dugout now
How you living? (wooh)
Did you turn God into your little business?
Who cares, I'm winning
And I gotta go on

How y'all feeling tonight?
Make some noise for Jesus, yeah

You ain't getting worse homeboy
You ain't getting worse homeboy
Play the church take the birds home
Never heard you talk 'bout the word no more
Except when you tryna defend your dirt homeboy
My God
You done let your eyes go
Started fornicating with your iPhone
She keep her body too tone
Then the light goes
Send emoji eyes those
Said that you would never bite tho
(Too smart for that)
'Til she showed up at the show in the front row, row
Probably would've panicked
But you gone off that solo
Wear the same outfit that you left that comment on
Saying one thing to the crowd
But in your mind taking her clothes off
Went down in the DM
Pushed your flight back
Knocked here room 103m
Came around 1:03 a.m.
Wait, uh oh, hold up, she in (wait)
Where your wedding ring at? (wait)
Wait can you keep a secret?
Can't believe it, my God
Yeah I'm a weer
Crucified Christ again that's that double treein' at the Double Tree
How many ended like me here?
Oh, not one did
You were there before you checked in
You've been driftin'
Nobody wakes up addicted
Every great fall's from 100 bad decisions
Whole legacy passed, you just no-looked it
Lost in the sauce, didn't know you're slow cookin'
Remember when you didn't wanna be alone?
All you talk is numbers
Took the filters off your phone
When you stopped callin' on your pastor when you got home
Spendin' more time with Instagram than the Son of God, oh God
Miles from the shore now
Wifey left with both of the boys now
Daddy, daddy, daddy why you let it go down?
Was mommy not enough for you to hold down?
Tell me where we gonna go now
I don't wanna be here
I was just a man last weekend
Can I be a king after Bathsheba?
But David never danced again
He limped all the way to the end

It's over
It's over
It's over
