[Featuring: Tank]

We livin' good
Everyday it's all good
Alright

Look, swag on if a dag on pimp
Rock can make the stiletto drag on rough rider
Now miotis throw your flags up, yes sir
You a burr that don't mean you dress fly
A lot of people hittin' on me, mad to see me on
You grouch, Oscar, Academy Award
I can play now, first, yea I had to do my chores
Met a cougar and she told call anatomy your ma
Even though I'm a minor I can do what a major bring in two
Any rappers overdue I'm like his hated
Bet you bottom dollar
You could place a wager, won't be saved by the bell
You an AC skater
Mirror mirror on the wall tell me who the greatest, you are
And what you do to the beat is just heinous
A few years back people used to pay us
I can smell the fix now somebody call the rippers

We're livin' life like a special occasion
Like every day is gluey as night (every day is gluey as night)
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Another day in paradise

I'm hall SV and my father
Get my fly, get my fresh, I'm Armada
This is my house, gettin' rid of all these waters
If you ain't gonna do it you know get off off the potter
First week watch my numbers match every produce
Blast off you can tell Houston we have a problem
My shoe faluca rude boy rewind
I'm tryin' to swim with the sharks but you just a sea ada
You're not on my level, we can never see eye to
Eye on my fly, you can call me young Sodom
Gomorra, the mall, took the history as I got 'em
(You sure that you got 'em?)
Yea, Perry I got 'em
And I'm about to run all you Jokers out of Gotham
You could throw shade but I'm a still blossom
A rose in the concrete, my echelon's peaked
She got my peak as an avatar swing

We're livin' life like a special occasion
Like every day is gluey as night (every day we livin' good)
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Another day in paradise (it's another day in paradise)

You say you're number one, I think you got your list wrong
This calculator like bro made from fifth blow
Four fingers up and each will have a ring soon
The king of rap, yea that got a nice ring to it
All in the fam, Archie, even if a few words go against me
I'm a make you eat it
I'm taking over, taking over Genghis Khan
So hot I can burn through the frame retort
Shh I'm talkin', everyone remain cool
I can teach you how to work it, trade school
It's my occasion, you're witnessing the torch passing
You can't buy love but I brought passion
I'm thinkin' massive, my money sick
I'm thinkin' magic, no pun intend
Believe me, I make it look easy
I'm good money, easy peasy

We're livin' life like a special occasion
Like every day is gluey as night (every day for me is a holiday yea)
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Another day in paradise (it's another day in paradise)

The big Tank ladies and gentlemen
[x2:] All day every day
