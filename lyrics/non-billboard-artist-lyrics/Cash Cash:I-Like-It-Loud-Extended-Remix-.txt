I-Like-It-Loud-Extended-Remix-:Cash Cash
Get this night off right
And turn the bass up
Blow my ear drums up
Just like a firetruck
Get this night off right
And turn the bass up,
Yeah, I like it loud
I like it loud

You know I like it loud, can't hear a fucking sound
My ears are ringing now
Cause that's how we get down
Down, down, down
Now move your body so the rhythm can set you free
Another round and we can drown out our hearts beating
Just like a drug I let the music set me free
I like it loud, I like it loud

Get this night off right
And turn the bass up
Blow my ear drums up
Just like a firetruck
Get this night off right
And turn the bass up,
Yeah, I like it loud
I like it loud

Shaking through your legs, the way the sub drops
Feel it in your chest, the way your heart stops
Get this night off right
And turn the bass up,
Yeah, I like it loud
I like it loud

You know I like it loud
Than your old fucking sound
You know I like it loud
Cause that's how we get down
bass up, bass up, bass up
Turn the bass up, bass up, bass up
up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up

Now move your body so the rhythm can set you free
Another round and we can drown out our hearts beating
Just like a drug I let the music set me free
I like it loud, I like it loud
Now move your body so the rhythm can set you free
Another round and we can drown out our hearts beating
Just like a drug I let the music set me free
I like it loud, I like it loud
I like it loud

You know I like it loud
Than your old fucking sound
You know I like it loud
I like it loud

Get this night off right
And turn the bass up
Blow my ear drums up
Just like a firetruck
Get this night off right
And turn the bass up,
Yeah, I like it loud
I like it loud

Shaking through your legs, the way the sub drops
Feel it in your chest, the way your heart stops
Get this night off right
And turn the bass up,
Yeah, I like it loud
I like it loud
I like it loud
I like it loud
Yeah, I like it loud
I like it loud
