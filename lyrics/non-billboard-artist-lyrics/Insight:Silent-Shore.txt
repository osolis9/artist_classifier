Silent Shore
Spending my life missing one inside of me, Thinking to my self why this is so 
unfair, Remembering how things used, Wishing I could bring back all that we 
shared.
(ch)
Haunded By Memories. Haunted By Silence.  SILENT SHORE

 Asking myself if love is ever real, Or is it something we wish to feel?
I know from my eyes I feel the pain, So is this love that still remains?
Chorus

I failed to see us fall apart, so I stand alone watching this silent shore.
To see broken pieces of my heart, Washed ashore from words I've heard - 
BEFORE!
