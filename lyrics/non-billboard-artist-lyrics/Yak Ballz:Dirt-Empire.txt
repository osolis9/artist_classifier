Dirt-Empire:Yak Ballz
get to work the empire of dirt wants you to work
and you, you better listen and learn before you get hurt
or worse if you don’t deserve to live
search to find yourself deep inside this hell on earth my friend

I see a patch of hope , no its an antidote cloak
must be a mask, a hoax dressed like a phantom no ghost
I try to laugh and joke to make the time pass go
Is it a trap for most that makes you happy? no broke
like its grassy slope but not grassy up close
transplants in homes like anthills with clones
I’m in the lab alone, I get it spinnin’ like pinwheels
so marvelous in pitch darkness with two sparklers

Sparticus walkin’ through the terrordome armorless
dagger through the heart of it, snap bone and cartilage
come to my, come to my city starve with us
God made dirt and dirt is a part of us
replace chewed up wires and spark plugs to spark it up
hit the toll plaza like a runway for cars and trucks
I used to count the water towers, dad drove
now i’m countin’ on out of towner’s to travel in droves
I mean, the skyline reminds me where I’m from
and how far I’ve come, I’ve just begun
you wanna be down? tarred and goosefeathered
then put yourself in a position to getcha’ a new profession
from post traumatic stress to pre-pubescent
Post to the Times read who perished
come on pay us a visit put it on your credit card
indebted to large corporations, slide your debit or

chorus*

whether you a harbinger tryin’ to exploit us
your kneelin’ on your hands and knees prayin’ to nothin’ more than a toilet
join us, sit have a drink let me spoil it
I will destroy and own where the oil is
avoid us, choose who roll with, voices
disappointment, election time, choices
we will protect the dream if it means puttin’ a team up
fortitude at its best for my people and our freedom
I mean, the landscape reminds me where I’m from
and all those wars won, who I’ve become
and its fun spreadin’ my name through a missile launcher spray nozzle
jet planes flyin’ under radar’s for paintbombin’
only the crimson velvet hue makes progress
green is what they say the world goes ’round with
we’re in the middle of a crucial conflict
you wanna make it, I want your tax dollars

and you can have it all
and you can have a ball
you’ll need nothing more
so you can laugh it off
and you can have it all
more drugs and alcohol
but you can’t set fire to a dirt empire

and you can have it all
and you can have a ball
you’ll need nothing more
so you can laugh it off
and you can have it all
more drugs and alcohol
but nothing is dirt cheap in the land of opportunity
