Her-Room-Marvin-s-Room-Remix-:Teyana Taylor
Chillin in my bedroom
Wife beater and my panties on
Just got a phone call
That you was out with ya new girl
The nigga that I did love
Really kinda threw me off
Feel like I'm drownin in sorrow
Where is my lifeguard

-Chorus-
Fuck that new girl that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that new girl that you think you found
But you callin me even when she's around
I'm just sayin with me and you had better
I know your boys have told you that lately
After me you couldn't find better
I notice that your new girl ain't me, ain't me

Kisses from a rebound
She just a girl you keep around
I see all of your phone calls
But I don't have the time to pick up no more
All the shit we been through
And I admit it boy I miss you (damn)
And I been sippin this champagne
A lil tipsy so I called you back to say

-Chorus-
Fuck that new girl that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that new girl that you think you found
But you callin me even when she's around
I'm just sayin with me and you had better
I know your boys have told you that lately
After me you couldn't find better
I notice that your new girl ain't me, she ain't T

You gon be trippin when I'm at a party
You see these niggas lookin at my body
You wanna grab me when you see me leavin
Won't take you back and I'll give you the reasons
I told you I'll leave knowin I wanted to stay
You didn't try and let me walk away
Startin to think all niggas are the same
Look on your face tell me that you're ashamed
Wanted to love you but now I'm afraid
You say you need me and how much you've changed
I don't believe you it could be just game
Trust isn't somethin you give out it's gained
Didn't wanna give up, Say you want me back now
Got my feelins mixed up I just wanna move on
I need someone that I could lean on
And it won't be a nigga like you

I'm just sayin we had better
I can't even remember that worth
Because you tellin me that you need her bad
Your new girl ain't me, she ain't me
