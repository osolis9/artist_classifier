What-Am-I-Doing-with-My-Life:White Boys
What am I doing with my life?
Pushing 40, no job, no wife
I live for the night
It's so empty but shit'll be alright
I often stare out the window
Thinking about when times were so simple
Now my dick got wrinkles
Sex life creepy, collecting dildos
These days girls grow up young
Can't believe what they can do with their tongue (damn)
They must watch PornHub
Because they spit and twist on the dick like grown-ups
I can't commit to shit
A cell phone plan, or better yet a bitch
My life seems hopeless
At least I got drugs and the kid ain't homeless

What am I doing with my life?
I don't know, what am I doing with my life?
What am I doing with my life?
Oh yeah, having fun getting pussy every night
What am I doing with my life?
I don't know, what am I doing with my life?
What am I doing with my life?
Oh yeah, having fun, party every night

It all started on September 3
Two years ago, my girl don't remember me (bitch)
Now I'm just history
I feel like James Caan, Misery
I used to chase all the pretty girls
Now I chase the dragon, it's a fucked up world
And I'm sad as shit
Alone at home playing Madden lit
They say the grass is always greener
Other fish in the sea, one day you'll meet her (yeah right)
She'll probably end up a cheater
Fuck your best friend in the back of the theater (ho)
Double feature, ugly creature
She used to be so much sweeter (used to be)
I thought she was the one
Now she gone, where the fuck is my gun?

(HOOK)

Hello, I'm Jeremy Gritter
Beardo, career's in the shitter
Shoulda, woulda got signed
But no, I chose to snort coke lines
Wish I would've been writing rhymes
Caught my girl sucking dick on Vine (oh my God)
Now I'm depressed
Like a teenager hanging himself to death
If I had a AK
I'd get drunk and blow myself away
I lost my bitch (gone)
I lost my car, now I'm losing my shit
I'm staring in the mirror
I hate you Beardo, looking through a tear
So what's the point to life? (what)
To get a wife? Fuck that, I'mma going to stay high
