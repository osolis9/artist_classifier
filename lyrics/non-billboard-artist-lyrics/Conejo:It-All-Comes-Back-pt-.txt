[Intro]
I'm A Take You Motherfuckers Back To 91'
Homies Was Doing Juvenile Life Up In CYA
While The Rest Of Us Was Out Here Killing Motherfuckers
From Left To Right, East To West
Check It

[Verse 1]
Mi Historia Empieza
En Mi Barrio Chingon
I Heard There Was A Party
At My Homeboys Canton
And Everyone Was Going
And Everyone Was There
The Party Was Slipping
And No One Really Cared
But The Putas Rolled Up
And The Putas Rolled Up
From All The Fucken Primos
Ese I Was Fucked Up
2 Ranflas Approached
Ese Going Slow
Everyone Dropped
When Them Vatos Unloaded
3 Men Had Went Down
And One Didn't Make It
So All Them Fucken Barrios
Ese Would Regret It
Now My Barrios United
My Barrio Was Tight
And All My Fucken Homeboys
Was Ready For The Fight
Mission One Mission Two
Ese Accomplished
And No Fucken Juras
Ese Could Stop This
Sometimes It Seemed
Like The War Would Never End
But The Guerra Went On
Again And Again
Hit Every Barrio
From The West To The East
Doing It For My Homeboys
That's Resting In Peace
The Streets Wasn't Safe
Loco Day Or Night
But This Fucken Night
Something Wasn't Right
The Devil Was Loose
I Could Feel Him Near
I Was Young In The Calles
I Ain't Had No Fear
The Jura Was Hot
Ese Everywhere I Go
The Jura Was Out
Ese Fucking With Surenos
Flashed His Lights
As The Homeboy Came
The Homeboy Got Shot
But He Didn't Explain
We Got To The Place
Where The Homeboy Was
And I Was Thinking About The Barrios
And Vatos That Hate Us
Could Tell By There Faces
The Homeboys Would Suffer
And After This Pedo
The Times Would Get Ruffer
The Homeboy Was Gone
And It Made The Barrio Mad
It's All Fucked Up
When It All Comes Back

[Hook]
When Bad Things Happen
It All Comes Back
When Bad Things Happen
It All Comes Back
When Bad Things Happen
It All Comes Back
When Bad Things Happen
It All Comes Back

[Verse 2]
Now Vatos Coming Down
That I Never Ever Seen
I'm Walking Around
Ese Looking At The Homeboys
Found Out For Myself
That Sur Is For No Juegos
Cause Every Fucken Barrio
Got Some Crazy Recuerdos
Now Everything Is Said
Now Everything Is Done
It's Time To Make A Move
It's Time To Get The Guns
The Tinys Did There Share
The Chicos Did There Part
I Knew It Be This Way
From The Fucken Start
So Who Is The Barrio
That Did All The Damage?
To All The Enemigas
In The City Of Los Angeles
It Must Be Us
Cause It Can't Be Them
Ese Wiped Out Your Barrio
Like A Fucken Hurricane
Sitting In The Lac
As I Rode With My Gang
Like I Trust No Bitch
Ese I Trust No Man
And Something In My Mind
Would Put Me Threw The Test
And It Wouldn't Let Me Down
As Long As I Was Down
Maybe Because
Someday I'm Gonna Die
Wanna Go Like A Soilder
Ese When I Die
So Ponle Pues, Loco Let's Go
We Gotta Show Them Putos
Que Mi Barrio No Es Un Juego
Ese I Killed Them
I Sprayed Them G's
Ese Brung The Enemys
To There Fucken Knees
Y Mi Historia Se Acaba
Con Estas Palabras
Ese Watch Your Back
Cause It All Comes Back

[Hook]
