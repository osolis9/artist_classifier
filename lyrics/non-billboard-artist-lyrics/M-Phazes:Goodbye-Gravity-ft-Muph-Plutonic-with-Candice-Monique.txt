Goodbye-Gravity-ft-Muph-Plutonic-with-Candice-Monique:M-Phazes
Hey yo that blocks where I used to cop a whole lot of Neighbour's stairs,
Looking at me like I'm lost, I was thinking What? What?
You know that I live there!
Go back to your doornobs and let me just walk on,
Polish this sauce off, could have been my hair
Or my jeens or the tear in my seems,
Or the wear in my feet,
Or maybe, just maybe, I could have been
Way more than that daytime TV, Believe me,
I know I ain't cut clean,
Rough around the edges in that pair of faded old jeens,
Cause they came pre pack with the wallet and keys,
Ain't got a spair dollar for the washing machine,
Hear clanging in my pockets, wasn't the sound of change,
But the sound of the bottletops of yesterday,
It was the same today, go out and get some, get some,
Come home again just to get away,
Whatever they said I wasn't listening,
Carry-b Backpack strapped in, carrying on traditions,
And you know whats inside that,
It's gonna be missing, within a matter of minutes,
They say it's bad for your business,
If you can't see straight everything's badly written,
Arseholes full of shit, matter of opinion,
So go ahead, show me your book of life,
I garruntee you too have some crooked lies,
Right?
Goodnight, Goodbye Gravity,
Let me go and your mind flow free,
So goodnight,
Gravity goodbye,
I know you'd catch me in the morning,
But now that ain't important,
I don't need your shit, let me do my thing,
So goodnight,
Gravity Goodbye, Yeah
First sip, lips on a bottle of Skirmany,
Never knew she could so truly demanding,
I'm handed the answers in the form of a solution, Liquid,
If the problems forgotten then I drink it,
But don't get it twisted though,
I'm pro party life,
You ain't gotta ask why, just look to the laughs,
and the stars in our skies,
Now sometimes, even the bar fly like I'm high,
So I'ma say goodnight, goodbye to gravity,
Crooked flight academy, flying throughout the galaxy,
happyly lost in my place, phone switched off,
Cuz' I learned from that play,
Drunk Dials,
The hand smells when you to a game,
The mess that we made,
The who we call and the what we say,
All apart of the performance we gave,
Can't recall getting home but we all okay,
So it's ok.,
Goodnight, Goodbye Gravity,
Let me go and your mind flow free,
So goodnight,
Gravity goodbye,
I know you'd catch me in the morning,
But now that ain't important,
I don't need your shit, let me do my thing,
So goodnight,
Gravity Goodbye, Yeah
I'ma say my goodbye to gravity,
I'ma let my mind fly through that galaxy,
I know they'll be catching me in the morning,
But right now that ain't important to me,
Let it go,
I'ma say my goodbye to gravity,
I'ma let my mind fly through that galaxy,
I know they'll be catching me in the morning,
But right now that ain't important to me,
Let's go,
I'ma say my goodbye to gravity,
I'ma say my goodbye to gravity,
I'ma say my goodbye, goodnight, goodbye, goodnight, goodbye to gravity
Huh
I'ma say my goodbye to gravity,
I'ma say my goodbye to gravity,
I'ma say my goodbye, goodnight, goodbye, goodnight, goodbye to gravity
Huh
