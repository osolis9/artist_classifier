Uh, it be those lonely night when you dim the light
And think maybe i could of made it right
If he just thought about me for once fuck " I "
If he said " We" for once
If only he invite me over, lay me on the sofa
Hold me close when i bleed this month
Make me feel warm inside
in the backseat or the front seat
In the car, bus or a taxi
I don't give a fuck i ride for you
Do what you tell me to
Don't trip at all, when another bitch call
Don't fix my tounge to ask she is
Cause i know what we got and i know what the fuck we is
I can't flex, i was obsessed with the way we fucked
You cum then we rest but now i think why did we sink
It's up to be like a bodycon dress
I said ring my bell, don't give me hell
Bring me flowers, but you didn't come to hours
He said baby what the hell my signal fell
I was just watching a episode of power
We finna go our own direction if you dont learn you lesson
you hurt me more than a weapon
You got no more, no more exceptions
You got no more, no more exceptions
losing our connection, in losing my reflection
Ima keep it steppin, fuck was he expectin
We finna go our own direction if you dont learn you lesson
you hurt me more than a weapon
You got no more, no more exceptions
You got no more, no more exceptions
losing our connection, in losing my reflection
Ima keep it steppin, fuck was he expectin
Now he wanna take the condom off
But not giving me love or nothing above
Is like giving me a dick thats soft
Usless, feel foolish
He said long as the dick stay good then he rule this
that not true
I know the man that i met before, but a new man that's a whore
That's not you
That ain't nothing but the devil
Knowing you young, looking for fun and not quite ready to settle
I spoke when i woke up
You ain't text back what's the hold up
I'm just sitting here wishing fucking on a man with a mission
This a hard decision accepting a man with bitches
Knowing im listed how can i miss this
When niggas don't listen
And something aint right but pause
And every night he come home from not answering the phone
Im so tempted to smell his drawers
But overall i love the way he grip me
i get a special feeling when he with me
That's what i breathe for, in not knocking that nigga
i'm just saying i need more niceness and effort
Cause i'm a good bitch
I can get a man that look like Tyson and Beckford
But that's out of style, you used to dry my tears
But now i use a towel
You gotta step it up or come an extra mile
Before you ever get a chance to milk this cow again
