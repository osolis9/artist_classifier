Open-Your-Mouth-Hypothalamus-:Prince Paul
Open your mouth
I'm gonna put something nice into it

Ooh, it feels good
Ooh, it feels good
Ooh, it feels good
Ooh, it feels good

Open your mouth
I'm gonna put something nice into it

Ooh, it feels good
Ooh, it feels good
Ooh, it feels good
Ooh, it feels good

Ooh, it feels good
(Open your mouth)
(I'm gonna put something nice into it)
Ooh, it feels good
Ooh, it feels good

So now we begin to see you as you really are
Repressed, hostile, sick, jolly about adjusted
Frustrated, aggressive, schizophrenic and masochistic
