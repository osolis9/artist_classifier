Stay-Awhile:Poetic Death
I was gazing at the screen of my computer/
Lurking on your Facebook/
By now a daily habit/
See I've had my eyes on you/
For like the last ten months/
And now that you're a residence/
I figure why not/
I heard about the party downstairs/
A bunch of trouble makers/
But this was meant to happen/
Just a matter of time/
Those butterflies they always talk about/
They start to kick in/
I put my hand above my heart/
Before I take a breath again/
I've encounter many females/
But none like you/
Thinking back to our debates/
I would have never let you/
But you remind me of my mother/
And she's a very strong woman/
Who's in touch with her emotions/
You know I need that on my right side so/
I made my way downstairs/
And you were sitting at the kitchen table/
An empty chair/
This is destiny/
The first thing that popped up in my head/
I don't really come from much/
But I hope she'll give me a chance/
To stay awhile/

And when you're sleeping at night/
Or standing in the shower/
Thinking about your love life/
Parties out in nowhere/
Driving in the darkness/
Haunted by a car crash/
Do you (do you)/
Do you think about me/
Because I think about you/

Both of us were nervous/
With our hands under the table/
We were playing with our fingers/
Everything was very natural/
Some would call it magical/
And others call it science/
But whatever it may be/
It has yet to walk away from us/
But anyways/
Let's get back to the story/
And by now we're on the front porch/
Some black guy was talking/
But you were rocking shorts though/
And cuddled up beside me/
Those butterflies were back/
And I was thinking possibilities/
I wonder if she's digging me/
I love the way her hand feels/
But then the conversation ended/
Could this be real/
And I'd like to walk you inside/
She told me go ahead/
But then I walked into her bedroom/
And shut the door behind me/

I kissed you on the lips/
And I never felt so good/
In my entire existence/
You looked me dead in my eyes/
Said do you know what you're getting into/
I laughed/
Looked you back in your eyes/
And said the same thing/
Flames of a different breed/
But flames none the less to me/
I stole another kiss from your lips/
Then left the scenery/
Back up in my bedroom/
I was feeling like a dumbass/
I was happy at the same time/
I finally get to know you/
And you shared so many secrets/
And I learned about your family/
That moment at the hospital/
When I couldn't find my car though/
I told you about my tattoos/
I saw your insecurities/
And you saw right through me/
So stay awhile/
