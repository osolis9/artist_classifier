Tragedy:RZA
Word up; Wu-Tang up in this joint
Wu-Tang Forever
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang Forever (here comes the rain)
Word, Wu-Tang Forever (here comes the rain)
Wu-Tang Forever, the Ryzarector in your sector (here comes the rain)
From Shaolin to the holy city of Mecca (here comes the rain)

Yo, yo, assassination, vaccination, poor education
infatuation with Satan with global nataion taxation
Fiberoptic microscopic biological germ
Mad Cow burger on the market, Captain of your starship
I never departed once I started
to explore these regions that was uncharted
Leave your heart broken, yo I stand tall
like buildings on Van Dyke's, all mics
Beats strike like a noisy four train late night
Chase got New York for the Life, we out of state
Can't smoke a bone in the staircase with out gettin chased
Penny candy poisonous rappers, best to chill or get your head gashed
Lemonhead, sour patch kids, best to grab
a Life Savor, I'll Jawbreak ya, Boston Bake ya
Then plant my sunflower seed on every square acre
The beauty of my nature shown through Shaquaisha I Mecca
When I made myself Equality, known to my reflector
Stay in your playpen boy, and babble for your formula and cried
You pacified, this lullaby from the black butterfly

Here comes the rain again
Falling on your head like a tragedy
Falling on your head causing new demotions
Not even...

Yo, yo, I'ma show this metamorph-is as the King takes his office
Keep my planets in orbit, never forfeit, or quit
move forward, I talk with the awkward slang
I walk with, the Wu-Tang, yo
Heavy thoughts can't be held down by the laws of gravity
Watch for the lime in the temple tryin to plot your tragedy
A game rank with, the high officials at the banquet
For attemptin to hijack the Wu-Tang Manual under his blanket
Can't interpret cause your brain is short circuit
This dumbness left your body numbness try to come amongst us
What's your angle? Rectangle or triangle?
As my truth of square drains you of your power the death angel
strangles you like a weed, choking the helpless flower, you cower
You feel the power of the final shower!

Here comes the rain again
Falling on your head like a tragedy
Falling on your head causing new demotions
Not even the naked eye, can see
Not e-eeven the naked eye, can see
(Tragedy)
Here comes the rain again (the reign of terror)
Falling on your head like a tragedy (fallin on your head like a tragedy)
Falling on your head causing new demotions
Not even... eye can see

Word up, word up Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang Wu-Tang
That's right, ninety-seven February
Wu-Tang comin at you, word up
