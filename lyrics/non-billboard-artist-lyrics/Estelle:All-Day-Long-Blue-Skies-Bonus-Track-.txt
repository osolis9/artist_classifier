All-Day-Long-Blue-Skies-Bonus-Track-:Estelle
Blue skies are lookin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies who I see
And there's bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

People say I'm selfish
Yeah, they say I'm not the same
Yeah, they say your girl's changed

Don't ask me if I feel a thing

The ones who put the pennies down
Say we're never stayin' around
Busy at the bed we made
So what you think they're gonna say?

People keep on talkin', let them talk away
(Let them talk away)
Sometimes you gotta give up and let them say what they say

(Let them say what they say, what they say, what they say)

All I need is my God, nobody's bigger than He
So I say, go ahead, it's free publicity
(Go ahead, go ahead)

'Cause I got
Blue skies are lookin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies who I see
And there's bluebirds singin' a song

Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Watch me as I close my ears
Hold this on the positive
Sittin' in a first class lounge
Take me up above the clouds

See I and everything I have
All will pat me on the back
Watchin' you, I keep around

'Cause they're the ones that keep me down

I was born on the out and this is why I go in
(This is why, this is why I work so hard)
I got too much to lose so I ain't stressin' one man)
(Ooh, I won't, I won't)

With the good comes the bad and then it turns to great
It's so far at the back, this is a vengeance, love swayed
(As a vengeance, love swayed)

That's why
Blue skies are lookin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies who I see
And there's bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long
