63 Tennessee
Though the marriage was thru
Lil dude called q
Born to Connie McHugh
Little mick
Little wop
And a little cherokee
And a little african american apparently
Brother got soul
And mother gotta bounce
Sunny cal for the gal and the boy with the brow
Daddy two was a dude wasn't quite what we liked
I was glued to the tube cuz real life wasn't right

So we moved nomadic in a panic
I was bruised hyperactive and erratic
Hated school a dirt bag with nerd facts
Dropped out ripped tickets at a jerk shack.

I escaped manhattan beach where they rent tapes
Pontificate new wave and its french babes
Extrapolate all day cuz I got raves
Talk shop non stop while I got paid

Wrote a script bout mallory and mickey
Story’s kinda gorey some said sorta sickening
Wrote a rom com bout a elvis quotin creature
Fall in love at a sonny chiba triple feature

Stole a hooker from a pimp stole coke from the sopranos
Then he sold it to joel silver before everything goes blammo

One script in the stack in which I wanted to act
Fuck rejections by readers in one year they’ll retract

QT motherfucker
Late fees motherfucker
I’m droppin n-bombs like what motherfucker
Transform motherfucker
You’ve been warned motherfucker
Bitch slap from a kangol capped motherfucker

Liked to act honed my craft on the side when I could
Saved my pennies started dreamin started schemin hollywood

Got excited bout my writing in two years I wrote three scripts!
No one bought them it was rotten and I almost lost my shit

Can’t deny it I decided time to get off the pot
I could shoot it myself and give it all that I got

I could direct star and edit and fetch a bag off stops
Don’t need a corporate clown holdin me down in a headlock

So i went to a party wearing my finest tiger print
Ready to schmooze and get vagina on my dick

Then I met my defender by the name of lawrence bender
And he said you got some moxy u obnoxious pretender

Read my script and loved it said it needs a budget
He dropped it and shopped it to courtly curmudgeons

A briefcase of cash that glowed was bestowed
Some say that it’s gold but I know it’s a soul

QT motherfucker
Late fees motherfucker

Eddie was a betty like to talk like a bitch
Mr white was the type who’s too nice for his niche
Mr pink was a hater who wouldn't tip waiters
Mr brown was gunned down but he savored the flavor
Mr blue was a con so his humor was minimal
Mr orange was the sort who never consorted with criminals
Mr blonde was a vega so his brother was vince
Everyone head to the rendevouz daddy’s gonna be pissed

QT motherfucker
