Cinnamon:The Cool Kids
[Verse 1: ~Mickey Rocks~]
Raise your left hand if your shirt ain't whack (that's righhtt)
Ladies, keep your shirts intact
And in fact, I been friends with a couple girls
That burn cigarillos better than most fellows
And hello, it's good to meet ya – a Mona Lisa picture
Ain't painted with the same features, baby
Can't keep your lady if she ready to go
You can't 'cuff her, I just got rid of my coat – it's kinda hot,
I'm somewhere on a boat – crab legs in a pot
Let 'em soak while the water heat up
If you broke, then the lottery up – the winning ticket is us
How many chicks can we fit in a bus?
So get a cab – tryna get my message across
So Stacy, dear, if you're listenin', then gimme a call
Givin' it a shot, like Pau Gasol
So all the girls rollin' up, this one's for ya'll

[Chorus:]
Excuse me, can you tell me where we are?
She was lookin' like cinnamon
Cinnamon
Cinnamon

It seems like I forgot where I parked my car
She was smellin' like cinnamon
Cinnamon
Cinnamon

[Verse 2: ~Chuck Inglish~]
(Yo)
I'm a long shot, shorty – Nigga, frog-hop for me
Formerly Cuban with them bow and arrows, gorgeous
A handful, lady, need another hand to hold me
Normally, you couldn't get a call back from me
Talkin' like – "Chuck, you should be so lucky
Most guys couldn't get a wink back from me (psh)
You're special, not to let her catch 'good-lookin'
I think that's the reason why my man's handcuffin' "
Well I guess you made bail and I'm not tryna swing
A Bengal tiger by it's tail – so yes, do tell
It's the story on the blory war games,
I heard you had to tell me something important
It's an email, forwarded
I check when I get it, get it when I check it
Boom-stickity-boom-stickity- daz and infect shit
Nah, just talkin' nonsenseness
Miss Mac princess to +peace+ sign and I'm out

[Chorus:]
Excuse me, can you tell me where we are?
She was lookin' like cinnamon
Cinnamon
Cinnamon

It seems like I forgot where I parked my car
She was smellin' like cinnamon
