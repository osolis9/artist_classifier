Suffering:Capleton
Got to do something before it's too late
Got to do something and do something great
Get you all together and step up to the plate
I hail Rastafari straight

Got to do something before it's too late
Got to do something and do something great
Get you all together and step up to the plate
And defend the human race

You should a know seh Rastafari indigenous
Send the youths a college, education some sivile up
Tell the former man no giving up
Gwaan till the soil an plant
Keep digging up
In still yo morals keep the youths dem living up
Cyaa employ if yo no develop
People seh dem need more money inna dem envelope
No care if dem married or dem single up

Dem suffering too long
Dem suffering too long
Dem suffering too long
Dem why yo make it so hard
Yard an broad

Yo pressuring dem too long
Yo suffering dem too long
Dem a feel it too long
Why yo make it so hard yard an broad

Dem seh poverty a climb it internationally an local
Cyaa stop mi fire nor dem cyaa take mi vocal
As dem get dem vote, dem get antisocial
Dem a ice an dem a age, an now dem warming global
So deh system yah well it too awful
So mi find out seh Babylon no talk good
Cup a run over meck dem know seh wi heart full
Help the people dem yo better start cool

Dem never full filled a only false promises
Till nuff people lose dem sanitizes
Nuff a dem go sell dem soul through vanity's
Tell mi seh the best not quality
Sell out the ghetto youth dem yo know seh wrong it is
Tell dem fi clean up the economical damages
Selector play deh one yah cause a number one it is
More fire man a blaze

Ever wonder how the survive when they home with you
Invite dem for a plate a meal in your home
And if the come to your bank then would you give dem a lone
Dem catching at the straw like dem out fi drown
Den would you give dem a smile
Or would you give dem a frown
Or you just stand there an watch dem going down
Would you do something for dem, to make dem table turn around
