fairytale lover by utfo

they say if you believe in fairytales, your love will never fail
if this myth is true, sweetheart you know what we should do
be like alice in wonderland, jack and jill holding hands
and every afternoon we can watch the cows jump over the moon
and if it happens to get cold we can take a walk down the yellow brick road
and if you wanted to we'll go eat, we can help u find the street woh woh oh

a love thats full of fun and fantasy, thats the way our love will always be
this you won't regret (won't regret), cause i'll be your romeo and she's my juliet
alice in wonderland, jack and jill holding hands
and every afternoon we can watch the cows jump over the moon
and if it happens to get cold we can take a walk down the yellow brick road
no turning what we'll find, we'll handle at the end of the line

and be fairytale lover (ooh ooh mmm)
be my fairytale lover (lover, lover, lover)
be my fairytale lover (lover, lover, lover)
be my fairytale lover (lover, lover, lover)

love won't be alone, in our fairytale own town
we'll have house built out stone, and no warewolf will blow it down
rainbows in the sky and our dreams will get us by
and love will never die ooh ooh woh woh
