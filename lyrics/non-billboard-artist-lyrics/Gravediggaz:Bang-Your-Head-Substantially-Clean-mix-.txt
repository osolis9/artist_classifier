Bang-Your-Head-Substantially-Clean-mix-:Gravediggaz
(Rzarector)
Bang your head! Bang your head!
Bang your head! Bang your head!

Rzarector!
You are not the same that I was when I was younger
I'm old with the Clan from my land, down under
Deep in the darkness, just like you regardless
Of who? It's obvious! Wee... ha!
So lounge in my burial ground, boy, my despot
I build a house on top of Salem's Lot
Front porch, bloody, back yard, muddy
Like Amityville, a family kills
Force of humanity, drove me to insanity
Duel in all my rivalries, I speak of profanity
Mothafuck this! Mothafuck that! Bang your head!

Here comes the killa with the Gravedigga sword, gimme room
Like devils in a Ouiji board I'm spellin' doom
Ever since six, throwin' mad stones
N' six catchin' vicks on a graveyard shift
Think it ain't a new phenom because my crew is on
Spots'll blow like nuclear bombs
With the killa instinct, rhymes are in synch
B-b-b-bang your head til it shrinks!
Midnight marauder, bodies are gettin' slaughtered
Bring a cross N' a bucket of holy water
You'll still'a be cajoled, cuz the mothafuckin' Gravediggaz
... act those
Snatch up your body, just like a clepto
Let's go to the graveyard spot
Count up the knots on the bodies that got dropped
So bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Yo,
I creep with the evil intent to represent
The course, the night, a swarm with the dark force
The killa brigade, twelve o'clock starts the raid
Torch is lit, oh rio grade
Feel no pain those exposed to the raven
Deep in every step, a blunt like Wes Craven
Yo! I eject the fume that spells doom
The wickedest flow, sweep ya up like a broom
Cuz from the shadowy graves of Medina high
You're one step away from the arena of death
Boom, bang! Here I am, the bezerk
The ruthless killa, yo, I do work
Dark forces thick, mothafuckaz for real
Here's a tale from the crypt
