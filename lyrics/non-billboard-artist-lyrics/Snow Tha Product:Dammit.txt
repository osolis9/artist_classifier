Dammit:Snow Tha Product
Look!

Yeah yeah yeah he used to be a player
Used to say he's getting that paper
And he used to call my friends haters 'cause they told me he was unfaithful
Yeah he used to say he work late but,
Then all them lies that he made up,
Really wasn't shit when I caught him with a chick
Then I had to cut em off like a razor
Now I only care 'bout my riches,
Got my, got my M with them sixies,
Cut my hair and cop six inch heels,
Get killed when I hit that switchin
Now he talkin bout that he missin,
Says he really wanna make his misses
Now he said he stop with them bitches
I said boy that's none of my business.
Got my ex-es saying damn it
Miss-missin what they had,
Now they beggin for me back and I'm a fucking take advantage
Sayin damn it, damn it
I got my ex-es saying damn it, damn it
I got my ex-es saying damn it, damn it, damn it,
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
I got my ex-es saying damn it, damn it, damn it,
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[?] I used today,
You said act like everything gray
But you used to fuck with girls like all day
Then he left me all around the way
But to say in goes, the players get play,
Your fuck is bro engages that shade,
What beat around and then he cut the jay
And then he just having a comedy of the day
See now he callin me something crazy
Been bout me having this gravy
Said he's everything bout me lately,
I'm like damn that girl that you shady,
'Cause he broke now he got no style
And left you with no car,
And I've been coming up in the game
And then she change you upon me I'm a star.
