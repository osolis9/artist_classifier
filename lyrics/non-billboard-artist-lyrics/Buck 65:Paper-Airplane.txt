Paper-Airplane:Buck 65
[Jenn Grant]
Down by the lake you saw me
and you knew i was waiting for you
looking inbetween those long greens
your reflection it fell upon
How we miss that love
[Buck 65]
the words written on my hand are hard to say.
a game of solitaire and no cards to play.
paper airplanes so far away.
[how we miss that love]
the words written on my hand are hard to say.
a game of solitaire and no cards to play.
paper airplanes so far away
[Jenn Grant]
crying for your letters
looking all through pictures that survive in the long way

to get from me to you
get to me
your writing me a letter
looking for my hearts with you*
in the water*
im right in the heart
the heart of you.
[Buck 65]
Distant tower hour on resistant hour signals with consistant power
eventually the shepheard must slaughter his sheep
the sky is ripped open and the water is deep
somewhere else the burning fire
your tempered charms
im lost in the woods with no voice and empty arms
admitting im stranded
commiting my plan
two stories written on my hand
[Jenn Grants]
How we miss that love (repeats)
