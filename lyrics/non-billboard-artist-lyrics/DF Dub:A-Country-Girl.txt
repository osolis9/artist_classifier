A Country Girl
Awww Yeeeah
She was a country girl from Cleavland, Texas
In the big city and she liked my necklace,
So we started talkin while we took a ride,
In the big pick up truck and my hat was to the side,
She was a country girl from the class of '96,
A big booty with some big ol country(damn!)
A country name with some country attitude,
Sayin yes ma'am but at times she kinda rude,
A daddy's girl so I had to watch my ass,
(?) would woop my ass,
We can't kick it, Im a city kid
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did...

Chorus:
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world

She like country livin and acoustic guitars
and Kenny Chesney and country bars
and Cadillacs and I couldn't relate,
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date,
And her dad hated me, I knew it,
He didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears and black music,
We still chill, cow tippin and trippin, with that (?) cause she was trippin,
A country girl, home cookin and grubbin,
Ain't used to my style, big limos and clubbin
A city kid and I'm doin my thang, 
I like an ol country girl and this is how I sang

Chorus:
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world

A country girl, cut-off jeans and lollipops,
tequila shots, tube-tops and liquor, stop
A country girl with them country ways living big city nights but them country days, Uh
A country girl dont understand funky,
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin,
A country girl, pig tails and care-free, 
no direct dish, just channel 3 (Is this the only channel you have?)

Chorus:
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world,
I fell in love with a country girl, 
A city kid in a different world

Country girls.... Taste like chicken
