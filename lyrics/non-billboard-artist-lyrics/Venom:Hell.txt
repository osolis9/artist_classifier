Hell:Venom
All the hate in this world I adore
Thousands of legions with black heart core
Riding high are my horsemen of four
Nothing's safe, no one cares, that's a fact

Hell, unholy kingdom ruled by war
Hell, pain and fury is the law
Hell, fire and brimstone I desire
Hell, Satan on his throne of fire

There's no love for the priestess of hate
Babylon nests in her kingdom and waits
Evil sanctuary screams and gyrates
Living hell, lake of fire, infernal

Hell, unholy kingdom ruled by war
Hell, pain and fury is the law
Hell, fire and brimstone I desire
Hell, Satan on his throne of fire

On the night that the black angel fell
I opened the gate for an entrance to hell
When he saw his new kingdom to dwell
Set alight in the fire of his rage

Hell, unholy kingdom ruled by war
Hell, pain and fury is the law
Hell, fire and brimstone I desire
Hell, Satan on his throne of fire
