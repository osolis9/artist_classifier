Everybody-s-Racist:Doc Brown
When you're down and out
And you're really up against it
just remember the basics.
It's a mantra, repeatedly say this:
You're not a loser. It's just every body's racist!
Yeah, that's right, I said it!
Why d'you think nobody ever give you any credit?
Why you last on the list of your doctor's patients?
Chronological? Or is your surgery racist!
What type of dog ѕhits on the pavement
in front of your house?
Alsatian. Racist!
Say you're typin' in a search engine, tryin' to write ‘haterz' with a Z at the end?
And your computer goes ‘Did you mean haters'?
That's how you know…Google's racist!
How come every time an igloo's made it's always white, hm?
Eskimos- racist!
Tonight you know the truth
Explain this:
Your car won't start. Engine- racist!
Your team don't pick you
These guys- racist!
Jeans don't fit you?
Levi's- racist!
If you can't lose weight
Every time you try it
On your birthday it rained in places
Ϝuck the clouds, the whole sky is racist!
You got an iPod, shufflin' the playlist
That ain't picked reggae in a while?
Racist!
How come every time you get to the cue you're the last in cue, dude? That cue's racist!
And then when you get to the front the staff say ‘Hey, thanks for waiting'- that's racist!
Cause the whole post office are skanks,
Why ‘dyou think they try and sell you second class stamps?
Two words: institutional racism.
You go nando's- suddenly they make chicken!
And you might want cuscus, or just soup.
Too late, man; they already judged you!
When you're down and out
And you're really up against it
just remember the basics.
It's a mantra, repeatedly say this:
You're not a loser. It's just everybody's racist!
