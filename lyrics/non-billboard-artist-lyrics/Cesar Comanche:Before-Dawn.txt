Before-Dawn:Cesar Comanche
Here we, here we 
Here we go, here we go
Party, party people in the place could be, yeah!
You know, what you know
We love to spread love (yes we do)
But we also know, that we know
We may never get it back!

So, you either love it or you leave it
Just the way that I perceive it
Then you say that I'm conceded 
Don't think that it's my fault
So my game, you want to throw, soul to soul, so lame!
Say .. your flashlight
You take me as your last right
Crumble in despite. 
All the love that you get from above in advice

Push your show better yet
Dialogue, door open!
Would you rather see just more pics of me
With my arms crawled in a bull's eyes 
It was dope!
So sad that you land there with hope
That I'm the enemy public
Friend of me? Yeah, and I'm making dub steps of YouTube videos upsetting
And all this cause of mic check? Come on, man!

Hook: 
Spreading so much love 
Until one day you'll find it's never enough
This is the love we get, no wonder we are so upset!
One time in a place!
Hoping that you'll get it back, 
Don't waste the time that I go too tough
This is the love we get, no wonder that we're so upset!
No time in a place! 

It's a shame if you be ... and your ass get the blame?
Same cat you assist, who
One day is gonna resist you, it's so true, yeah!
Square on a chin taker, 
Where do we begin? 
Green and I can't with the greed,
Plus I glare with the eyes of a snake 
This be the first thing to make 
Ya, glance up to the sky
Then shrug, and soldiers take a step back
Look at the size of this of this ...
Gonna take so many to move
Should you even try?
What your fashion... is?
Risk your ass, then start tying a rope that your hope
That's the maximum vortex!
Hope some other will invest, but you'll see

You should try not to overanalyze why...
Most of best of illusions and those keep causing confusion
It's so sad!
Once set off the launch pad
You will see, what?
Your colours, your true head
Plan to back you and be glad
Fell for the bluff, it's tough!
But homie, it's too bad
Trim ball, come back! 
Can't savage it all, gotta let it dissolve, 
It's alive while war fall back. 
In love with your bless... those lack
Or your future is Prozac.
Another or one way, 
Flagrant, want to discover
If your plans include a new day. 
The simplest choice is don't go, stay!
