Closer:Cadence
If brokenness is what I need
Then break my heart, take everything
Kill the death that lives in me
Bury what I shouldn't be

PreChorus:
Go on, put your love in motion
Go on, whatever it takes to start

Chorus:
I wanna be closer to the edge
Closer to falling into you
Closer to the truth
There's no life apart from you

If you need to wear me down
Well, here I am face to the ground
Flood my soul so I can breathe
Your holiness inside of me

PreChorus
Chorus

Bring me to my knees again
I wanna feel you closer than my skin
Can I catch a glimpse of you somehow
I'm ready to be near you now

Chorus(2x)
