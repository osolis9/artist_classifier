AK-Bullets:Street Military
We come with AK bullets better duck when we pull it
Motherfuckers they better duck us ‘cause we down to do it
These busters they fiddin' to suffer for bumping their dick suckers
Talking down out in the streets but can't touch us

Niggas get bust on touched on thinking they nuts long
House shot up with K's don't even know what's wrong
Your mouth gonna dig your grave what you say in your rap songs
Stick to getting paid while you keeping your cap on
It's unreal how motherfuckers change so quick
They get some money and get caught up in that famous shit
Live and learn up in your life you got to earn strips
Your turn don't come twice money first or burn dice

It's so real niggas think this game a joke
The law still treat a nigga like he's slinging coke
Ain't nothing changed but clips we're still dangerous.
Them niggas hang with us them killers trained to bust
This T&T; connection, Tennessee and Texas we fiddin to be respected
Our enemies get X's I send my G's the message
They tell me please we wreck it
All opposite sexes keep dropping drawers and dresses

We come with AK bullets better duck when we pull it
Motherfuckers they better duck us ‘cause we down to do it
These busters they fiddin' to suffer for bumping their dick suckers
Talking down out in the streets but can't touch us

Street Military here we back pump it nigga while you got it
Knowing we could have been dead or in jail or out of pocket
Packing a gun looking for a jack to be done
If all fails hit the block with the crack in my palm

I'm tired of that life, ridding with the riders at night
But when my money ain't right I get hungry and shife
I'm knowing the price, the consequences - fuck it
I got one intention I made some dumb decisions
Just to keep my money flippin'

I'm on the low-low, one deep - solo, a Sweet full of dodo
Don't need no more I'm still a dawg
I represent what's real and raw
In the dirt with the work trying to miss the law

But fuck them too they can get it just like you
Respect my crew or nigga I'll wet your suit
And best believe some motherfucker's chest gonna bleed
If these cops or these niggas don't respect these G's

We come with AK bullets better duck when we pull it
Motherfuckers they better duck us ‘cause we down to do it
These busters they fiddin' to suffer for bumping their dick suckers
Talking down out in the streets but can't touch us

The street you can't conquer it's death before dishonor
Beware the bounty hunter, Pharaoh in the county jumper
Flea in the camouflage ski mask Guerilla Maab
Ain't fucking with nigga's fraud run and go get your boys

My nigga we on the rise Burton Boyz Enterprise
Got work if you want to buy, shots if you wanna try
K.B. in the TG got killers that street sweep
Niggas that don't sleep and niggas that's gonna creep

Track you down like a Lo-Lojack, catch you like a running back
Cause you know I'm coming strapped, he never wanted that
I thought you did, so I'm quick to split your wig
Like a butcher do a pig, somebody go tell his kids
His daddy got popped by the loan maker, if owed paper
The nigga, I'm the bone breaker, the soul maker
For real niggas and bitches that's gonna check us
Fuck all traitors and fakers ‘cause see they gonna hate us

We gotta live, we gotta eat
We keep it real, We keep it street
