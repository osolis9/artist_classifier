Temple-of-the-Lost:Castle
A caravan of evil
Strikes across the sand
A golden age of war upon us
Dawning on the land

It's upon us now

Quest for fire - Power from below
Reaching through forever
But never in control

Temple of the lost
Offer up this shelter
One more from the storm
May bring disaster

A caravan of evil
Aerial march of death
Attacking from a distant land
A blood harvest of greed
It's on your hands now
