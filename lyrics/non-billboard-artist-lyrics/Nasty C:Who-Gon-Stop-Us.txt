Who-Gon-Stop-Us:Nasty C
I was up at 2am just written rhymes
And a thought came cross my mind
A text came through to my phone
You were the one it came from
Matter fact you the one in my mind
I've been thinking about you too much these days
We fuck too much these days
You way too hot these days
They treating a nigga like his Pack these days
I'm afraid I might just get shot these days
More downloads when a nigga drop these days
Your bitch
might get no my dick
no question ask she pussy pops these days
A little nigga just want a get raise these days
Everybody wanna take a pic these days
Every nigga think they can spit
I hate that sht
it make me sick these days
They call me the future these days
See y'all see the future these days
What the fck you can do to my crew
They love ... these days
They know how I do, I just fuck shit up, when I come through these days
Bad btches that will do want me say,
And I love how they ... these days
Son of Mars nigga
Summer bars hot than Satan
Yep
Sturning broods
who's dumb as ours
are rear nowadays
Yep

I was raised by who ever said there were raised in hell

Let me tell

the story how the fuck I got to be trending well

I'm too high I don't wanna come down

I like my feet way above the fucking ground

Me and my soldiers we gona run this damn town

It's too late for you to try to stop us now

Who gon stop us

Best believe I don't owe nobody shit
So I
Don't wave your tail and I don't want friendship
I just want fucking your bitch
If you think you buff and you got good luck and shit
Well than better up and spit
If not let a puppy sick
Watch a real ass rap nigga up and run this shit
Watch this
Young ass nigga
gonna kill your dumb ass,
scumbag,
young bad,
bitch
I'ma come back
little bitty like a drum pad
If a dumb ass
must ask
how I do this
come and grab a sit
Watch this young ass little G
Put together a master piece
While I smash the beat
By the way I wrote this half asleep
Till the clock in the morning
And your ass asleep
Rest in peace
I make you rest in pieces these days
Will I ever make it
It's basic
my hope lays on Jesus these days
You listen to what Nasty C says
His the one that on your speakers these days
I think they need us these days
