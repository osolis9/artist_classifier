Befriend:Quadron
[Verse 1:]
Be tender
Be strong
Befriend me
Belong
Be gone by dusk
But just be around
Be untold
Be young
Behold
Be unsung
Just begin with me
Before you end it

[Chorus:]
My rights don't get any better
When you're wrong
Though I'm technically alone
I'll endorse you to come close

[Verse 2:]
Tomorrow's
Today
Too little
Too late
Too slow to comfort
When I need to blush
A body
Of gold
Tormented
And cold
I'll hold you tighter
When you're letting go

[Chorus:]
My rights don't get any better
When you're wrong
Though I'm technically alone
I'll endorse you to come close

[Verse 3:]
Don't have to cut me up
To get what you deserve
For every wasted drop
An equal one returns
An equal one returns
Replacing my concerns
