Unsafe-Haven:Nino Bless
(feat. Neenah)



I'm roaming outside my safe haven followed by an angel
With a crooked halo, hey world
Hey world, hiding while this pain grows
And I'm just trying to maintain and take it as it the...

And I'm just trying to maintain and take it as it the...


Now I could graze it with my fingertips
Though this is all a simulation look how real it gets
Empty, till I dug in for something
Since then my limits been adjusted to shit the Guiness ain't publish, yet
Underrated, just know degrading me's worthless
Found it, no mistakes that void is shaded on purpose
Surrounded, by the least grounded
Hounds hounding me growling, trying to get me to eat what they're chowing
Weak, how can I not stress? My body has me suffering
Fed by elites face smugged, while obviously corrupted
Lobbyists run economy while the stock market's fucked with
So how am I to trust this, when Obama's just a puppet
My momma bought a house and lost it
Where was her bail out ya'll, but yet her pill habit the government supports it
Real talk shit, hold your applause, as my thoughts shift
I value criticism, depending on who the source is
Of course this is a course that's less traveled
But you can't settle and never concern where you end up
Just slipped, and it was so hard not to surrender
But I skipped the fall, so I'll be gone til November
And this zone, only I can enter
These others cats ain't on my antenna, fuck em
Trumping the odds like its nothing at all
On the plus side, negatives worked like golf, getting me up to par
Dog, what started inauspicious
Guarded and timid, has evolved I'm no longer constricted
By all the lies, and i will not oblige
My pride's my ride or die guide, la da da da
Shit probably my stock'll rise when I'm not still alive
To be real most ain't give BIg L props til he died
What if I get shot and I die, huh?
Y'all gonna say man that kid would've popped if he didn't get popped in his ride
Damn that's life I guess, whats life or death
Where you finally get that credit when they snipe your chest
At night i'm stressed like "i'm nice, where's my success?"
Then I think of my aunt when she put that pipe to rest
And its clear, fuck, the hype, the press, the lights, ice, begets
I'm getting more, they think I strive for less
I just rep myself, fuck who I impress
Don't know what i'll write next, just hope I'm taking righteous steps
Man, life's like rollin a dice, trying to get twice your bet
To get loose from this crisis, tight in debt
Its a fight to the death, you'll never put quite to rest
Like a psycho you wifed catching you skype your ex
Yes, we're divided and on this song I'm wired to guide us
The Golden Arm just trying to unite us
And it seems like I'm blurred from the scene & I'm sightless
Blackball speeding at me, I'm succeeding despite this
I see it now, coming in 2nd ain't winning
So the second i'm winded I'll dig and get a 2nd wind in
Press to the ending, while the rest are sitting
I know what I'm destined for, so I don't care if my records spinning
Hey I know there's skepticism, but my investment's different
I try to think like if Malcom X was living now
The restlessness while he'd spread his wisdom
For every single mom thats grinding through this reckless system
Or every little child who's parents got a meth addiction
Theres's more resources than ever, but there's less assistance
How? Fuck that lesson, skip it
I'm just venting, listen! (or not)
I know a lot of things don't change, love, pain, both work the same
That's worth to explain, when you gain and merge with a scene
Only rehearsed in dreams
I am reaching nirvana, while these haters take it in vain like Kurt Cobain
Word, go ahead curse my name, wish me well, wish me fall
I still got love for you all
Let me make this solace inside me contagious
While I infect you with a plague that changes your hatred, stay on this wave length
I feel like a savior in training, save this
You can't label me, stay away from me majors
And it ain't just standards that got me this cranked up, It's in my make up
I could've jumped ship I stood now I'm anchored

I'm roaming outside my safe haven followed by an angel
With a crooked halo, hey world
Hey world, hiding while this pain grows
And i'm just trying to maintain and take it as it the day goes
Preparing for the day I'm summoned by my maker
I'm laced up, don't need to need to stay up, hey world
Wake up, struggling to grieve with all this
Though it seems too hard, It's all too far a stretch but I'ma reach regardless
