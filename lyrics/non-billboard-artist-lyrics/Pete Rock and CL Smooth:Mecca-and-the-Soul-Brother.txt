Mecca-and-the-Soul-Brother:Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Okay, you wanna act trife and flip the script
With your Wonderama drama slash coma riff
That you're kickin' like Pele, flows even Bo knows
My versatility capability is simply [Incomprehensible]

Y to the O U N G, another G to the U N S
Let's back up, shortie, from the naughty like shortie
Berry Gordy with a forty gettin' papes, oh Lordy
Claim you shoot more rounds than an Uzi

Stop the violence, 'cause ya can't do me
New York to L.A. say what I play
So catch a runaway smooth like a Billie Holiday
You couldn't bag me, boy, with a hefty

Train like Rocky but still can't step to me
So take a hint, money, leave it alone
And play like Stephanie Mills and 'find a home'
Plus I never boogaloo with Jacub

We're mixed with the tricks in a alphabet stew
When I design a army I can reign
But never have more beef than Saddam Hussein

The Night Cap, so prepare for a ca scam
When I turn your brain into Moogoo Gai Pan
Finger lickin' the papes like there is no other

Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother

Schizophrenic on a panic I do work
When you lurk with the professional ceremonial expert
The bold swinger, the Asiatic acrobatic
Lovable, sing the blues when I tap it

Save the mystery for Agatha Christie
Gimme a break, better wake Chief Kanisky
I'm not your ordinary modern day clichee
'Cause I'm here to save you little lost souls anyway

Go with the flow with the fleets when it executes
Any comp livin' got buried in black suits
The limelight never let it confuse you
It was a fantasy island without a tattoo

The hardcore few tend to look for
It's true, can't buy a knuckle game in the stores
Makin' movies like your name is Faye Dunaway
To hear the rumor echo in the project's hallway

You want a fast break, me no static
But Mister Whipple can't dribble like Magic
I yolk 'em up in domination nerds got scrambled
The Tony Randall left in shambles
Finger lickin' the papes like there is no other

Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother

Let me see, Pete Rock is like salad dressing
When I toss another lesson
Ready or not, prime time after seven
I pull women like a wisdom tooth
Without any conversation with Doctor Ruth

Makin' all the girls wind with the glamity
When Doves cry, Apollonian and Vanity
Picture the Mary Jane frame on a mantle
Consider me a vandal the Virgin can't handle
And never clown downtown with passage, yeah

Popping that yang riffin' homie don't play dat
So don't gas the kid to make a movie
While I'm smackin' a booty who just love to rock a doobie
Even though I make petty cash like a beggar
With no stash I make [Incomprehensible] sweater

So the night cap of rappin', no slackin', backin'
Hand clappin', feet tappin' Chief and Captain
Could finger lick the papes like there is no other

Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother
Mecca and the soul brother
