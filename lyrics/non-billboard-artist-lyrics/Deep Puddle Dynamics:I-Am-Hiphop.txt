I-Am-Hiphop:Deep Puddle Dynamics
[Sole ] 
Well its 7:45 oh yeah 
we'll see who's the bigger man 
Other dead men walking 4:00p.m. I heard a dead man talking 
He said its inconsequential 
for get it its nice 
I'll always get into harlots Ville with this knife getaway 
I don't want to buy you a drink 
forget to piss on your pride little girl 
Yeah stepped on your feet 
you want to eat that dirty white how what ya looking at 
The cap 
bartender tender me some sex on the beach 
before I reach out and impediment your speech 
Once I get'em in my reach 
unprecedented impeach 
He saw a double crossed dance illuminated by disco lights 
Unseen unspoken 
in a scene provoking a thought provoking scene 
in a smoke scene interrupted by intervening disco lights 
aint nobody dancing 
aint no music everybody still 
I can only see one man 
he looks good enough to kill 
so I muscle my way through dustless of imposers 
10:30 to 10 feet away 5 fingers surround the object of entrapment 
I don't need to see his eyes 
I feel his jack then his shirt then his skin then his kidneys then out 
then blood then blood then blood 
then neck then blood then blood then blood chest 
Then I see his girl watching over him 
like she is gonna cry his little ass back to life 
This is my only way I know 
so I must remove the knife 
We eye to eye now 
goodbye to his life fool 
I told you I would get my five dollars back tonight 

[Slug] 
Another night (night) 
Another dollar (dollar) 
Another crowd I enlisted to make holler (now scream) 
Another I really wish this crowd was a little bit larger 
Excuse me mister promoter 
could I bother you 
For a couple of bottles 
of premium placed on the stage 
For me and my brethren you know beverages 
Intoxication balance and leverage 
Guessing this is that point where I grab the mic and make my point 
kick my flow make'em say hoooo 
blow the lid off the joint 
ahem: blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
and then they befriended I love it when this situation happens 
This the type of crowd that build self esteem 
Come 10:30 is was I finally felt that sting.. 
(commotion. Yo yo yo yo (hes got a knife) 
yo what the fucks going on right here, 
calm the fuck down calm that shit down (that's blood) 
check check get'em up get off get off) 

I shed another blood you knew I would 
I feel you should adapt 
can't run forever trapped death stepped up to 
shed another blood you knew I would 
I feel you should adapt 
can't run forever trapped death stepped up to 

-SORRY JUST ALCOHOL 

[Dose] 
Thanks anyhow its just been one of those days alcohol only 
How can you not sell fucking cigarettes at a bar excuse me 
but I wonder where those two wild women are 
I've gotten off one minute they're all ears and big eyes 
then they're wandering off 
to bark up the next mans tree EXCUSE ME 
thank you Jesus Christ this place is 
now that's a foxy young lady 
if only she would put some clothes on (excuse) enough 
I'll just bend and stay in the mean market.. humm humm humm 
who are these that shits pretty dope 
but I can hardly hear his vocals and the bass is too loud 
Actually this kid is nasty 
to bad I can't hear the words (excuse me) 
damn like he couldn't have just walked pass oh and the stare too 
See everybody want to show you 
how big their and how little they think 
I be if it 
is that the chick Jim was trying to get on she's alright 
man its hot as balls in here why did I wear this 
(screaming) he's√¢ got a knife is that blood 
Oh my God I've never been this 
that's blood he's dying, gone 

[Alias] 
Uh uh.. oh my god twisting and turning 
what's that sensation of burning 
yearning to witness some spoken words but now I'm learning 
but I cant step into the outer limits of my abode without 
kids acting hard staring glaring 
yes I'm in the daring mode 
My girl debated me going out at 
this nocturnal time she said I should just chill 
stay in the house and write a rhyme 
I disagreed and ventured out 
Totally against all of her wishes 
stated that if I went to this particular venue 
I would later be needing stitches 
but my manhood 
in the need to ease my mind has forced me out to check and see 
what this up and coming lyrist is all about 
Arrived at the show at 9:45 and they're saying these kids are live 
Waited in line to pay my fee to take my entrance to this dive 
Already performing up on stage 
these kids outside smoke deuce 
the rhymesayer had the crowd by the balls while up in the dj booth 
final manipulation is complex in the body of its sound 
mesmerized in higher elevated on the shoulder I feel a pound 
My right side and his right side 
connected accidental 
he's staring in my vision 
and taking Said something about knocking out dentals 
then tried it on slowly 
I paid no attention to his words 
cuz perusing any challenge by forth at this point would be absurd 
I saw no familiar face in the sea of goatees and baseball caps 
which is fine with me 
Cuz this ocean is filled with mindless saps 
just then I heard a scream behind me 
there was quite a commotion 
I felt something tap my back once 
then repeated in this motions 
oh my god twisting and turning 
what's this sensation of burning 
yearning to just witness some spoken word but now I'm learning 
I should have listen to my girl when she spoke up and debated 
if I had then my body and soul would not be separated (oh my god)
