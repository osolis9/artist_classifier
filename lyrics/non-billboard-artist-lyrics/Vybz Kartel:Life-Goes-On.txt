Life-Goes-On:Vybz Kartel
Everybody waan go to heaven
But nobody don't waan fi dead
All di pastor weh tell mi Corinthians fifteen verse sixteen seh
For if the dead do not rise, Christ is not risen

Life ah di greatest (mi see)
Wish me coulda live forever yeah
A nuff juvenile dem life waste, throw away dem life inna gun play
Mi wonda, when a my day, if the chariot, a go my way,
Angels, at the doorway, Jah kno (It's like a wake)

Fi all of the prisoners dem wey a hold it inna di penitentiary
Fi all of di falling Gaza inna di cemetery
No way, me nah go rely pon weh de pastor tell me
Mi know seh life goes on, as one gone one born
(Awhoe)

Life goes on, mi no sure bout heaven mi nuh sure bout hell
Life goes on, if none a dem real then time will tell
Life goes on, Muslim and Christian don't tell mi yuh mission
Life goes on, religion ah division
(Hold on)

Tell me what is life purpose
Weh di sense you preserve and a nurture
I yah man work hard fi him future
And dem, melt everything in work fah
If yuh aks me, me ah ansa, fi a worth fi mi sons and mi daughta
Mi know seh life goes on as one gone one born

Fi all of the prisoners dem wey a hold it inna di penitentiary
Fi all of di falling Gaza inna di cemetery
No way, me nah go rely pon weh de pastor tell me
Mi know seh life goes on, as one gone one born
(Awhoe)

Life goes on, mi no sure bout heaven mi nuh sure bout hell
Life goes on, if none a dem real then time will tell
Life goes on, Muslim and Christian don't tell mi yuh mission
Life goes on, religion ah division
(Hold on)

Everybody waan go to heaven
But nobody don't waan fi dead
All di pastor weh tell mi Corinthians fifteen verse sixteen seh
For if the dead do not rise, Christ is not raised

Life ah di greatest (mi see)
Wish me coulda live forever yeah
A nuff juvenile dem life waste, throw away dem life inna gun play
Mi wonda, when a my day, if the chariot, a go my way,
Angels, at the doorway, Jah kno (It's like a wake)

Fi all of the prisoners dem wey a hold it inna di penitentiary
Fi all of di falling Gaza inna di cemetery
No way, me nah go rely pon weh de pastor tell me
Mi know seh life goes on, as one gone one born
