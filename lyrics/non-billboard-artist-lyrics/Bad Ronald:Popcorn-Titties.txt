Popcorn-Titties:Bad Ronald
Popcorn titties, rubber ass

I hate to talk about your mom but she's in my class
She got popcorn titties and a rubber ass
She jumped out the window with a dick in her hand
Singing, â€½Hey, motherfucker I'm a supermanâ€

Here's a lyrical daydream to tickle your head
Shocked for a minute when you heard what I said
It's like waiting in bed with one eye on the door
She not coming over, she don't love me no more

I didn't even ask and your mom got naked
Till I told her the truth and she just couldn't take it
I met your mom in class she was passing notes
Pretty soon I had my dick in her ass and throat

Had to hide under the bad when your dad came home
He fucked your mom for ten seconds and he busted his loads
I couldn't hold it in, I had to break out in laughter
I ran for the door and your dad chased after

He tripped on the steps and busted his mouth
I stole his fuckin' wallet, laced my shoes up and bounced
I might see your mom again it's not likely
Don't be mad that your little sister looks just like me

I hate to talk about your mom but she's in my class
She got popcorn titties and a rubber ass
She jumped out the window with a dick in her hand
Singing, â€½Hey, motherfucker I'm a supermanâ€

Tell your mom stop calling me
Stop calling me on the phone
Tell your mom stop calling me
Tell your mom just leave me alone

Me and your mom sitting on a fence
She was picking my balls with a monkey wrench
Wrench got hot, she burnt my balls
Pissed all on your mom's overalls

Now I hate to talk about your mother, but she's in my class
And Lord, you should see the way the gal shook her ass
Fast or even slow with a twinkle in her eye
Plus, she hook up a nice turkey club on rye

Like she get a natural high, when I give her ass a slap
And she beg me to freestyle pornographic rap
Crap first time I met her, swore I wouldn't cave
But later on the same day she dug her own grave

Drunk at your party, she shot me a glance
And she was decked out in high heels and tight black pants
Backwards I admit it, that's exactly how we screw
And I love plugging up, the hole that made you

I hate to talk about your mom but she's in my class
She got popcorn titties and a rubber ass
She jumped out the window with a dick in her hand
Singing, â€½Hey, motherfucker I'm a supermanâ€

I hate to talk about your mom but she's in my class
She got popcorn titties and a rubber ass
She jumped out the window with a dick in her hand
Singing, â€½Hey, motherfucker I'm a supermanâ€

Tell your mom stop calling me
Stop calling me on the phone
Tell your mom stop calling me
Tell your mom just leave me alone

Your mom got a big ol' butt, oh, yeah, uh, huh
Don't know how it got that way, uh, uh, no, I don't

But one thing I do know is that
I'm never jokin' when my nose goes pokin'
Into places that should be just left alone
But then I skip school and get in mood
To go to your mom's and just bone

Yo Kaz Gamble you here to see Tom?
A double, I'm here to butt-duke his mom
A yo what up dog, I'm here to get mine too
Well, then save me a spot 'cause I'm next after you

I hate to talk about your mom but she's in my class
She got popcorn titties and a rubber ass
She jumped out the window with a dick in her hand
Singing, â€½Hey, motherfucker I'm a supermanâ€

I hate to talk about your mom but she's in my class

Tell your mom stop calling me
Stop calling me on the phone
Tell your mom stop calling me
Tell your mom just leave me alone

Your mom, your mom
  (Popcorn titties, rubber ass)
Your mom, your mom
Your mom, your mom
Your mom, your mom
