Who-Want-Beef:Uncle Murda
(Hook)
Money talk, who want beef niggas
Money talk, who is these niggas
Money talk, where you bees niggas
Got some sooners with me, Lil Chief Keef niggas
Don't ask me if I'm good nigga
You can see that I'm good nigga
I pull up my own road nigga
And I push a nigga what nigga

(Verse)
I wish a nigga would try me
I get this whole hood by me
Caught them slipping in this girl car
Smoke them bullet on tape sip it the world's gone
I'm still moving bricks at hard
Your main bitch don't even get my dick hard
Nigga, nigga just watch
Nigga, nigga just watch
You shining in the wrong hood
I'm bout to get you got
Give me that gold watch, gold rings and gold chain
He got all gold everything on looking like turna that jane
You rocked to that james, I ain't rocked to that james
See when all gone, everything on, looking like turning that james

Drive that rarri in my projects nigga
Hot than a mother, I'm the pali nigga
She said she a dancer, she not a stripper
But she bust that pussy open for a dollar nigga
Fuck boys we on it, your game's been decoded
My meat beat 3 quarters, your bitch she deep throating
That's your hoe but I'm mean deep in her
Carter mall I won't skeet skeet in her
(Bang bang) I got Chief Keef in her
You eat it like a 3 piece dinner
Even when I'm done load that glock around
You ain't talking money nigga not now
New jays on, my shades on
You raise up and get shot down
My young boys they go home, send 12 bullets in one hoe
They ride loud like Lil Kim and they break you off with that drum roll
