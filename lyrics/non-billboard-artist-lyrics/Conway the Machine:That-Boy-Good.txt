2: Keith Murray
Hi it's Mr Tacky, you wanna get at me?
I'll go on a stabbing spree and clap happily
I never won a grammy or a BET award
but i'm still the best at spitting these Murray-phors
Street???? get flyer than easter
She said I love you Murray,
I said nice to beat ya
Damn fam you gave her the back hand
Cuz when she seen me in the street
She break sing out there go the trojan man
Spaz over the track, paint the city black
In this new era watch me snapback
Hashtag that nigga
Einstein was a genius right
But he married his cousin and sniffed coke all night (junkie)
Keith a street geek, greater than alexander the greek
Ya goddamn mama shut the fuck up when i speak
In your local tabernacle rocking in any hood
Sexual chocolate got the congregation singing out

I be all on my G shit (That Boy Good)
Top 5 that's breathing (That Boy Good)

Miilkbone's bad meaning bad, not bad meaning good
had the white kids, the suburbans jump up screaming hood
wouldn't believe if ya could, behemoth when i stood
in front of preacher understood, in front of jesus on the wood
I left my wife with a sense of rolling dice on the wrench
life gets intense, bitches call me white picket fence
nah man, i'm being alone, drink on my own
bring in the zone, ink on my tone, think what i own
always ante up for pride, either damage me or ride
keep my anarchy aside and pull them panties to side
sleep under my bed seen kids guns to their heads
dopeboys can run ahead so they can eat some wonderbread
coincedental, simple 33's my instrumental
you just 45s, you need a little spindle in the middle
duck low and suck with me. i would never fuck Iggy
I slept on Snoop's couch, but I'ma always trust Biggie

I be all on my G shit (That Boy Good)
Top 5 that's breathing (That Boy Good)

Not bad meaning bad but bad meaning (That Boy Good)

The city doing bad, (But) I aint got an issue on me
Niggas want sympathy (But) i aint got a tissue on me
have to keep the pistol cuz these niggas keep on flipping on me
cuz they aint got a genie for the shit that they be wishing on me
i aint just selling it, hoe i excel in it
niggas wanna revel in the fact they aint relevant
she playing like she celibate, bitch you aint celibate
as soon as i fell in it, she tell her friends (That Boy Good)
put a rack on it. you hustle put a pack on it
my niggas bled the city, you aint even put a scratch on it.
niggas back packing it but couldn't fill the pack with it
i shut the streets down, while you watched like an accident
my niggas is generals, the pen is the pinnacle
niggas is beyond lame. the game is pitiful
OGs is losing, i just keep doing it.
fuck what feds think. them boys aint proving shit...

I be all on my G shit (That Boy Good)
