Stunts:King Sun
[ VERSE 1 ]
Yo check it, there's a girl around my way
Don't ask for names, cause I won't say
She's a real pow-wow who likes to play
Nah, dukes, her name ain't Fay
This girl couldn't be 19 or more
Always waggin her tail and on all fours
Real big hips with legs so healty
I asked her who's her man, but she won't tell me
Every now and then she might spend
Sometime with another female's boyfriend
Why? I don't know, maybe for fun
If you got the burger, she got the buns
Who you do with it, is your own thing
One time she nominated me the Burger King
I think of it now, even as I rhyme
We all determined she's a real good time

But a stunt
Is just like a blunt
Burnt
And a hoe
Yo dukes, they burn you slow

[ VERSE 2 ]
A pair of tight pants is all it takes
And the next thing you know, old Jimmy's awake
Believe that, Jimmy has to get loose
I recommended her to be my personal masseuse
She's a real fly girl if you get to know that
Take her to a party, watch her throw that
Party into gear, like she was a jeep
Four-wheel drivin into the sheets

Stunts
Are just like blunts
Burnt
And a hoe
Word dukes, they burn you slow

[ VERSE 3 ]
The more you listen, the better it gets
I still haven't mentioned the girl's name yet
Anyway I continue, I do intend to
Say a little more, not to offend you
Baby, maybe you enjoy the diss
Tell me, love, do you remember this?
One Monday night it was me and the gees
On the avenue puffin the sensi
Hasheem and Foundation was on the phone
I broke out to see if you were home
Got to your house, went around the back
You had on a night gown with nothin underneath that
Took me in your room, hung up my coat
Asked me if I wanna play _Love Boat_
"Yeah, how do you play it, remember?", I said
Then you pushed me into your waterbed
Raised my sail, squabbed the deck
Came up and put a hickey on the side of her neck
Worked me over and got undressed
Sent me home and said I needed to rest
I went on the ave., weak as a mouse
Build wasn't out there, he was at your house
Stayed for an hour, then he left
Shabazz went in, Melquan went next
Hour by hour, minute by minute
I wonder if you cleaned it before we got in it
A few days later I said wait a minute
I saw all the Gods sittin in the health clinic

Stunts
Are just like blunts
Burnin
And the hoes
Word em up, they burnin slow

Check it out:

[ Doctor ]
I have some good news and some bad news for you guys
The bad news is: you guys are all dripping
But the good news is: I have these penicillin shots for you]

[ VERSE 4 ]
There you have it, see what I mean?
Served my justice by a big butt in jeans
Now I know the actual truth
Never again will I mess with -
If you can rhyme, fill in the name
Don't get upset, just play the game
Remember her bark is worse than her bite
I wonder who the girl is with tonight
Maybe a drug seller, a crackhead, drunk
And he's nothin but a donut ready to dunk
She's nothin more than a female hound
Doin 3 to 6 years in the dog pound

But stunts
Yo dukes, just like blunts
Burnin
And the hoes
Word em up, they burnin slow

I hope my girl ain't checkin this out, man
I'd be in crazy trouble
But yo, I'ma get with y'all brothers later, man
Gotta go take this dosage, man
Peace
