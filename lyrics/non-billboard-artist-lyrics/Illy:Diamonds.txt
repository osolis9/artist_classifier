Diamonds:Illy
Let's run away together//
escape from the parade//
it's better late than never//
to be on our way//
don't need a map, just follow the track//
don't need a map, just follow the track//
diamond cuts a diamond//

and she said, im leaving ima take flight//
when iv gone i wont ever come back//
and i know its not fair, you can come or stay there//
its on you, but i couldn't take that//
well i couldn't take that, she turned down any offer of a map//
said shed find her own way, heading off familiar tracks//
we caught between war and the opposite of that//
but thats what you expect when two opposites attract//
me and her walking two straight lines my equal//
lead to the answer, she more than a sign//
sparkle in the limelight, its more than the shine//
and it ours, not hers, not mine, and wel be fine but still//
she'd lay you down, heart bleeding through the mattress//
offer you the world and not leave you with an atlas//
soft words and fast actions, she catch it//
she held out her hand, without ever looking backwards said//

Let's run away together//
escape from the parade//
it's better late than never//
to be on our way//
don't need a map, just follow the track//
don't need a map, just follow the track//
diamond cuts a diamond//

what a tangled web we weave, she said she couldn't breathe//
knocked off her feet but she'd never retreat, and me//
although first cuts deep, its a release//
and im too lost to try and stop the bleed//
i could never let it be, cant decide if im everything you need//
or if i need to be your everything for me and my reasons//
guardian angels fighting inner demons//
and clarity of thoughts impeded, still im//
in the trenches for her, ride to the ends of the earth//
lost in the sunset, done spent what its worth//
but here we are, hand in hand, for better or worse off//
my jewel, vice versa//
as much beauty as danger when you talk about trust//
but she's a trip too good to pass up//
soft touch, hard love//
she closed her eyes let herself go, felt the rush///

Let's run away together//
escape from the parade//
it's better late than never//
to be on our way//
don't need a map, just follow the track//
don't need a map, just follow the track//
diamond cuts a diamond//
