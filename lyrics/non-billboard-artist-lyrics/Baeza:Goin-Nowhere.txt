Goin-Nowhere:Baeza
Seems like my life can't balance itself out
one thing goes good then I get hit by something else
but that's life I ain't complaining all I'm saying
It's the only time that I'm praying
it's when you ain't laying with me
I know theres more bish in this seat
but I'm in this thing too deep
and you get what you paid for
our lovin wasn't cheap
so imma hold on to this cold bone
till I know one thing for sure
and you so gone and I'm so wrong
for not keeping all up pure
and I know you think I'm immature
cause I'm young and I'm reckless
but you shine girl like my necklace
and yo beauty without cosmetics
and I just want your acceptance
don't mind me I'm venting
yo energy is a blessing
I'm in love no second guessing

So if you want me I'm here
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
So if you want me I'm here
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
So if you want me I'm here
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
So if you want me I'm here
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
(Uh)
good days turn to bullshit
cause you think I got a new bitch
please lets not do this
I'm like "these hoes I want nothing to do with"
there you go just a assume shit
ain't the first time I've been through this
damn
fuck that shit, I'm out
storm out cho house
but when I get home,
you all that I be thinking bout
I hate this shit
it's getting late n shit
let me smoke one
I guess Ill just be patient shit
you just leave me wating
with no reply
I might just die
I hate to see you cry
look me in mah eyes
it hurts tell you lies
what kind of man am I?
but I can't learn from my mistakes
if you don't let me try

So if you want me I'm here
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
So if you want me I'm here
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
girl I ain't going nowhere
So if you want me I'm here
