I love the mall
On an off day, hangin' out
Hey babe, come with me to forever 21 real quick
No Thanks
Come on babe, I wanna try that shirt on
I don't like that place it makes me feel old and frumpy, I don't like it
OK, fine
I'll be out here, I'll wait outside, I'll wait out here
I'll run in real quick
OK you go in
I love this place, good vibe
Woah, oh, ooo, ouch, jesus
Babe
huh? hi
What are you doing? what are you looking at?
You're back soon
What are you looking at?
You're back soon
They didn't have my size, what are you looking at
I was just looking at her, that girl, her jeans
not, her her, but her jeans
You were looking at her jeans...
I thought you'd look nice in those jeans
You were looking at her jeans...
They're new Jordaches
Well, why don't you buy me some?
