Love-Live-Life:N-Dubz
I love the lights, I love the life
Live it to the fullest, no regrets, I'm proving
They wanna know why I celebrate
Tell 'em it's my birthday each and every day

I wanna love, live life
I wanna love, live life
I wanna love, live life
I wanna love, live life

You gotta love, live life, love, live life
Love, live, love, live, love, live life
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up

You gotta love, live life, love, live life
Love, live, love, live, love, live life
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up

I love the dream, I love the mix
Beautiful people, all dressed up in labels
Sipping the finest, eats are gourmet
Glass in the air, now the round of champagne

I wanna love, live life
I wanna love, live life
I wanna love, live life
I wanna love, live life

You gotta love, live life, love, live life
Love, live, love, live, love, live life
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up

You gotta love, live life, love, live life
Love, live, love, live, love, live life
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up

It's a celebration, friends family look around me
It's a celebration, the life that I live now never found me
It's a celebration, see a couple paps tryna take pictures, 'low me
It's a celebration

One things getting low like she needs some attention
But I didn't come to give any affection
I told her back it up on my lower section
And man, I'm already onto my selection
Anyone comes closer, bang connection

It's a celebration, it's a celebration
It's a celebration, gotta love, live life

You gotta love, live life, love, live life
Love, live, love, live, love, live life
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up

You gotta love, live life, love, live life
Love, live, love, live, love, live life
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
Put your hands up in the sky, raise 'em up, raise 'em up
