Better-Daze:OPM
Assination from
The kid of creation
Blazin' disaster
By devious station
Face it
A permanent vacation
A tastin' from
The tree of temptation
Blazin' and hazin'
But never quite placin'
The movement of the stars
Pr the rotation
Tokin' I'm smokin'
From LA to Oakload
In some dreams
I'm drownin'
In others I be chokin'
Money, money
Make the world go round
Money, money
Just bring me down now
And I'm lookin' for
The higher ground

Hey now let's start nominatin'
So long I live my life
Without sayin'
I know I got to
Change my ways
I'm waiting on better days
Hey now let's start

I don't give a fuck
And let me tell you why
I woke up this morning
And I got high
The day passed and
The stars went up
I made my mark and
I heard pop pop?
There's a voice in
The back of my head
Another death and
Blood been shed
Evil lurks in
The hearts of many
Dollar signs on every sin

Money, money
Make the world go round
Money, money
Just bring you down
And I'm lookin' for
The higher ground

Hey now let's start nominatin'
I live my life without sayin'
I know I've got to
Change my ways
I'm waitin' on better days
Hey

Money drugs
And everybody listens
Nobody stops on the point
That they're missin'
In the system
Whatever price you can write
Even if the price is
The loss of another life
We used to be stick up
Kids regret doin'
The things that we did
Tryin' to live positive

Murderous attackers
Battlin' fascists
Bejamins and Jacksons at the heart of the actions
Think you would be missed
If you didn't exist
So stay the the hell off
My muthafucking shit list

Money, money
Make the world go round
