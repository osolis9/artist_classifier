All-In:Gift of Gab
To me it seems you've lost your steam
Your steam, it seems you've lost it, lost it
Demons haunt your thinking
Freedom gone and all exhausted, exhausted

Dreaming dreams of fortune
All your deeds are impromptu and not in sync
With laws and warnings never heeded
While you block them marching forth

And choosing what to keep
And leave consistently you're falling
All in nothing, please I'll tweak it out
I think I'm on to something

Now you're beat to pieces
And the pieces and the parts are busted
All your greatest thinking got you sinking
In the rotten gutter

Now it's nothing left
But everything to gain, no options
So you walk the narrow steps
To the domains that have been calling

Soldier, all of the resistance
Kept you out from what is within
If you follow it, it rises from inside ya
Up and over, all in

Spent half my life on a search for nothing
I came up with something, it's on again
I found myself by the river and jumped in
It's all or nothing, gotta be all in

Be all in, gotta be all in, be all in
Yeah, it's all or nothing
Be all in, gotta be all in, be all in
Yeah, it's all or nothing

To make me feel right, give me wealth and real life
And then mix it together like popcorn and butter right
Over the Tapatio, sit and I talk to Rio
Listening to music like that old Inner City Grios

Pretty females, all in my life
Yup, that's how it had to be so now I call one my wife
Give me my order organic, I need my border Hispanic
I mean I love it in Cali but out in Maui it's wow-wee

So somebody get me a ticket, no, need for packing a biscuit
I want more laughing and giggling, need more passion and wisdom
Give some and take some, I don't want no fake ones
If I need new friends then I'll make some

Spent half my life on a search for nothing
I came up with something, it's on again
I found myself by the river and jumped in
It's all or nothing, gotta be all in

Be all in, gotta be all in, be all in
Yeah, it's all or nothing
Be all in, gotta be all in, be all in
Yeah, it's all or nothing

Put your hands up high when I step on stage
God to my side, microphone on blaze
Wanna be on point, brand new white shoes
Need to be in the cut 'cause I paid my dues

Need to hear good news, when I make moves
Need to make music if I wanna eat food
Need to make a meeting if I wanna stay clean
Don't wanna be a dope fiend, keeping that beam

Up on the back of my neck
When I trek with a team on the road that be acting a wreck
Need a book full of hope and a bag full of tools
Combat the demons that sleep in my shoes

Need a pad and a pen to release all the pain
At it again, playing the game, not staying the same
Changing the patterns of thought on a man
'Cause I'm all in the head, all in

It's all or nothing, baby, it's never ever maybe
You think I might be crazy but I gotta be all in
It's all or nothing, baby, it's never ever maybe
You think I might be crazy but I gotta be all in

It's all or nothing, baby, it's never ever maybe
You think I might be crazy but I gotta be all in
It's all or nothing, baby, it's never ever maybe
You think I might be crazy but I gotta be all in

Spent half my life on a search for nothing
I came up with something, it's on again
I found myself by the river and jumped in
It's all or nothing, gotta be all in

Be all in, gotta be all in, be all in
Yeah, it's all or nothing
Be all in, gotta be all in, be all in
Yeah, it's all or nothing

All in, yeah, it's all or nothing
All in, gotta be all in
All in, yeah, it's all or nothing
