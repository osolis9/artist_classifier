It-Can-All-Be-Taken-Away:MC Paul Barman
"I buried my daughters and wife with these hands
After our house was bombed," said the war-torn man

I guess I'd do the same if I'm unlucky enough to get the chance
Teardrops fall off my face, and stain and wet my pants

[Nawlens and O]? like they say "no doy"
Balzac, please get us two crayfish and two lobster poboys

Oh boy, it would stink if my city fell in the drink, and we died
But when it happens, it happens in the blink of an eye

No one sits around, glad they're not blind, but maybe should
We can find genius and tragedy in every neighb'yhood

God enjoyed the schaudenfruede. Is he making me pay?
At any time at all, it can all be taken away

Tender clutch, sense of touch, smell, taste, sight, hearing
When you lose a leg, it's not like you lost an earring

What seems permanent is really temporary
That's why a memory doesn't never scare me

Just kidding. The past, it haunts me like ghosts
But pre-production's over, and we fix it all in post-

The only roast I want from Friars is barbecue
Breaking up is easy. It's growing up that's hard to do

It's unpleasant to think the future could be worse than the present
But at least you enjoy the moment and stop and think for a second

It's getting a little late in the day for fate to convey
It can all be taken away
