Unconditional:Lightheaded
We've been around, got all worth dreaming of
Saw the other side of love
But tell me where we're going now

Time's been rough but so amazing
â€˜Till it seemed your luck was fading out
Tell me where we're going now
Don't the days eventually
Bring us where we should be

When I'm gonna meet you here in time
Even in the darkest night
We're finding out that this is unconditional light
If you can't stay a little while
Hold you head up high and smile
We'll find our way if this is unconditional light

You caught me dreaming, one eye opened up
Said you couldn't ever stop
So tell me where we're going now

Hiding safely under blankets,
Little did I know you meant it I
don't know where we're going now

Oh, is it you that brought me to high tide
Sun in the starlight, sparkles in twilight
Oh, is it you that broke every skyfall
Showed me a life where light is unconditional

When I'm gonna meet you here in time
Even in the darkest night
We're finding out that this is unconditional light
If you can't stay a little while
Hold you head up high and smile
We'll find our way if this is unconditional light

And when our flame is burning low
Then who will tell me where I should go
And when I find me lost inside
There's a light that never dies

When I'm gonna meet you here in time
Even in the darkest night
We're finding out that this is unconditional light
If you can't stay a little while
Hold you head up high and smile
We'll find our way if this is unconditional light

I'm gonna meet you here in time
Even in the darkest night
We're finding out that his is unconditional light
If you can't stay a little while
Hold you head up high and smile
We'll find our way if this is unconditional light
