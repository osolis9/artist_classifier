Sabi-Dance:Rasheed
han han hanhan han Raheed

Inside the zanga
My people love to faji
Oya come and show me something
Baby shake and put it on me
Inside the zanga
My people love to faji
Baby come and shake it for me
Ma kowo le e lori

Do the dirty wine
Abi nah galala
Do the dirty wine
Shay you sabi dance?
Oya dab!! Shoki!! Shoki!

All of the girls they just dey call
Cause the money don dey pile in
Somebody wan dey spoil me
No time to be shouting
Won polongo pariwo pariwo palantia pariwo paper

Shout out to my loyal fans
And I hope say you understand
E no easy to be popular
This hustle is so muscular

Eni to laya lo le wo (lo le)
Won le jawa lo le mo
Eni to laya lo le wo (lo le)
won le jawa lole mo

Do the dirty wine (Shoki)
Abi nah galala (Shoki)

Shay you sabi dance? (Shoki)
Oya dab!!

I be die hard I be hustler
And I dey para on a regular
Local international
Catch me if you can

Eni to laya lo le wo
Won le jawa lo le mo
Eni to laya lo le wo
won le jawa lo le mo

Inside the zanga
My people love to faji
Oya come and show me something
Baby shake and put it on me
Inside the zanga
My people love to faji
Baby come and shake it for me
Ma kowo le e lori

Do the dirty wine (Shoki)
