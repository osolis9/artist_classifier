Torture-Chamber:Koopsta Knicca
* send corrections to the typist

Mystic mystic mystic

[HOOK]
Mystic stylez of the ancient mutualations
Torture chambers filled with corpses in my basement

Here dem come waitin to come
Say is it the sun the sun don't come
In the middle of the ocean oh so lonely
Hey day here she blows
Oh Lord someone save me
Where which way to go
Moses faded massive Satan ships totally sinkin
Man which is it it Koops
My tender skies is gettin darky
Darkness overhead wicked holidays
In too deep ride wit me bloody seven seas
Man to be wicked do now
Tell me what must I do
Gotta get my sentries blessed them dead
Or the Koopsta's through I LOVE YOU!

[Bridge]
SHOULD MY SHIP SINK?
(Don't drop it cuz they ain't ready fa ya Koop)
SHOULD MY SHIP SINK?
(Man fuck that shit they scared of the Triple 6)
SHOULD MY SHIP SINK?
(But we gon drop it anyway cuz y'all love us
Y'all haters)

The message of thy ship say killin medlows
And thy Koop
Mane do unto the others
As shall have them done to you

HOOK to end
