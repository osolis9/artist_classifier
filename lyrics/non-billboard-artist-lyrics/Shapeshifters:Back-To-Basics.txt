Back To Basics
Oh, so long together,
forgot how you made me feel,
tired of each other,
we drifted further afield,
but there was nothing out there for me,
I realised you're all i needed

now that i got you caught
i don't know what i did before,
you've made my life so special,
everything that I had before you,
give it to me with much more,
that's why I can never let you go,
no..... 

Bring it back, to basics,
You and I..i..i will make it right,
Take it back, erase it,
You and I will make it right,
Bring it back, to basics,
You and I..i..i will make it right,
Let's get back, to basics,
back to basics,

Couldn't remember, 
just what made me fall for you,
searching for others,
they make me feel all blue,
but everytime i felt that feeling,
I knew it wasn't what i needed,

First i nearly got you caught,
I felt better than i felt before,
you've made my life so special,
everything that i could want you,
give it to me every part,
that's why I'd never let you go,
no.... 

[Chorus]
Bring it back, to basics,
You and I..i..i will make it right,
Take it back, erase it,
You and I will make it right,
Bring it back, to basics,
You and I..i..i will make it right,
Let's get back, to basics,
back to basics
