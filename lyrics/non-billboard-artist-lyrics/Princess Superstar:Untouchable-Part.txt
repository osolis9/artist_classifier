Untouchable-Part:Princess Superstar
PRINCESS SUPERSTAR
Miscellaneous
Untouchable Part 1"(feat. 7Even
Ooh here I come not what you expected
Y'all erected while I wreck shit next bit hard while I wreck it
Elected prom queen on the strength of my last record
Hectic get nekkid and do it backstage after you all exit
About three minutes start countin back seconds
I got sexists beggin me to make me breakfasts
Winnipeg to Texas, Easter egg to Xmas
Ass in excess make them other senseless girls look anorexics
Ain't nobody can do what I do, can't have what I have, untouchable don't be mad
If naughty girls need love too then I guess I'm bad
Flow like Maxi Pad, magic Alad it's just some crazy spark I always had
Y'all are gonna feel like Chris Columbus when you discover me
Under the covers undercover in reverie readily I'd say I was bigger than Jesus
Save the formal apology for my Anthology and Regis
[7EVEN:] Stand off/hands off
The Princess resussin y'all fresh air in the game
Hands off she's untouchable, untouchable what, untouchable what, untouchable what, untouchable
right
I'm the finest of the best and if that don't make sense
Who cares look at how I dress and if that don't make sense I'm gonna talk about you in past
tense
And if that don't make sense fuck you I'm a go smoke sens
Don't start a fight with me I don't care I'll bite your teeth
Get in ya shit like a colostomy impossible to compete with me
A Prophecy- I'm gonna own everything like I was an apostrophe
Number 1 on Billboard a record of just me coughing see
To heck with ya I'm kickin non-sequiturs
To all my competitors so out your range don't give a what if I'm strange
Come up to my room D'Angelo I want to bite your abdomen-what!
Have fun crush you lyrically like Nell Carter mixed with Big Pun and Run
Never outdone shinin charisma only one star can outshine and that's the sun
I got a vision itchin to be an imposition invadin domes and homes like a religion inquisition
A juxtaposition let's fuck you pick the position holdin the front of the fridge bangin your
bitch in the kitchen
Diamond in the rough? I'm rough on the diamond-Gotta be nice if you want in the hymen
If you an MC you better be nice when you rhymin
And if you get me a seltzer it better have a lime and um
Memorize the name the Superstar, open your big mouths only if you about to go Rarrrr
On the ones, twos, threes and fives no 1200's I got 12,000's and I mean guys!
Easy on eyes I can't lie get high from rhymes to you know what I'm tight
What a lady, what a night, oooh, and if you think this song is through, there's Untouchable
Part 2
Untouchable in the 4X4 untouchable you know I got more
Untouchable and that's how we raw and that's how we raw and that's raw
