Little cookie man
Never Waved to me
So he got knocked out.
Because I flow
La Jiggy Jar Jar Doo
Dur Dur Dur Dee Dur
Man, I just flow
Shoeshine...
And no one wanted
your stinkin tiara
(Hey, hey, hey)
Cause no one wanted
your sticky chair.
And why you always talk
about the cool kids
Who take Archery?

in the air
(What kind of brick?)
Shouldn't matter
because a brick
is just a brick.

Dark days,
Darker nights
Found my way
down a hall
without a light.
Because I flow
La Jiggy Jar Jar Doo
Dur Dur Dur Dee Dur
This whole thing
where random dead people
try to kill me's
gotta go.

They keep walking
Walking my way.
If they're talking
Can't Tell what they say.
They keep falling
Over stuff i√±
in their way.
Dead dudes walking
Can ruin your day.
