Dub-on-the-Track-Solo-Version-:Cher Lloyd
La la la la la
La la la la la

I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.
I’m a machine, couple screws loose.
But I’m running smoothly.
Know what I mean?
Got an upgrade now I’m more unruly.
I’m hard to swallow
But a spoonful of sugar might
make it go down more easily

Pick up the beat
Put your money on me
I’m not the Queen
But I’m gonna be a princess on it
Like premium gasoline my words gon’ catch on fire
Spread through your body like heat.

I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.
I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.
I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.
I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.
Supersonic, ok.
Iconic, ok.
Astronomic, ok.
Get me on it, ok.
Electronic, ok.
Polyphonic, ok.
Get me on it.
I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.

Ima im beast on the track.
Laying beats down
put the vibe on the map
try cut me up, try knock me down
but you ain’t gonna take my crown
let me be the girl to mess up your plans
try take me, take me off the map
you will never get why I can

From my mouth better than these feet, these feet
why you gotta see there’s a room for me?
There’s a room for me.
Press a button up to the penthouse suite.
I don’t need all that
Rather be level headed in my one bed flat
Hold up a second, bring it back
I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track

I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.
I’m the kinda girl to put dub on the track.
