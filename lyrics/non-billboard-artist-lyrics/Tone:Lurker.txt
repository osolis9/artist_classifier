Lurker:Tone
Give the gift of hell to a unmarked soul. 
Scorn the cherished ones. 
Burn the flesh of the loved. 
I have never truly lived, 
and yet i still want to die. 
Never live, i just want to die. 
Kill me, kill me, take out my heart. 
Lost from the start 
and I've never been found. 
Take my life and take me away.
