Dishing-Dirt:Astronomy Class
You don't know what's real
Until you feel the little things
You find deep in your mind
Where you've been dreaming of
Is made of love
All those things you find will
Come in time
You got me thinking about
The things that I'd do for you
Thinking about
The things that I'd do for you
If we never wake up
Maybe we could fly away
If we never wake up
Maybe we can go some place
If we never wake up
Maybe we can take it slow
If we never wake up
Maybe we could fly away
Tell me do you feel the things I feel?
Do you wanna break away from all of this?
You got me thinking about
The things that I'd do for you
Thinking about
The things that I'd do for you
If we never wake up
Maybe we could fly away
If we never wake up
Maybe we can go some place
If we never wake up
Maybe we can take it slow
If we never wake up
Maybe we could fly away
Maybe we could fly away
Maybe we can go some place
If we never wake up
Maybe we can take it slow
If we never wake up
Maybe we could fly away
