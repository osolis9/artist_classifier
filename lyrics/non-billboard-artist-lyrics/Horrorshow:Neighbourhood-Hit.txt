Neighbourhood-Hit:Horrorshow
[Solo:]
Yes, yes, Solo MC*
Nick Lupi, Just Enuf
Haha "there goes the neighbourhood"
One two, one two
Oneday Crew coming through
To a neighbourhood near you

[Just Enuf:]
Well I'ma take 'em home past memory lane
Going eighty miles while I blow dust off it, let me explain
I'ma tell it how it was said to me same
Saturday in September, forget the weather but remember the train
A dead grey ghost embedded with flames, I didn't get it
Hype mag in my man's room, I went and read it
He said "You wanna bomb the lines?", replied as if my shit ain't stank
"Bank on it, I'ma get my credit"
Every tag on the wall's like a line from the credits
Just because you seen it ain't mean that you read it
Mics, markers, douse the flame, embrace darkness
Grant your wish, life after
Self doubt, guess I got that from my father
But my drive outweighed it by far
To the real fans, get 'em up, KBM the stadium we getting up
Whoever get there first, hit us up

[Chorus: ~Solo~ + (Spit Syndicate)
One day is what we chase
But now we out for much more than fame
I guess some things change
(We used to try to keep the neighbourhood hit
 Now the same dudes is tryna write the neighbourhood hit)
Went from back lanes to backstage
And now we spray words without paint
Time waits for no man and so we got no time to waste
(It's just me and my brothers, you chilling with none other)

[Solo:]
Step up in the place with the swagger of a genuine pride
It's the return of the kids bombing mainline
Spitting rhymes written by the same drive
That had us out till daybreak hitting the train line
Laces strapped, tins tucked in your backpack
Chasing dreams that we traced out of graff mags
We studied lessons from a culture of kings
Who could have what tomorrow would bring?
See there are walls in the streets round my neighbourhood
That read like photo albums
Moments in time, frozen for those who know about 'em
Snapshots of kids growing up staking their claim
And now the very same kids is tryna blow it up
And there's been some stormy weather but whatever
Believe that me and my brothers, we weather it together
Till I'm old and grey and my words fade away
Like plum purple in the sun's rays, I'ma rep the Oneday

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Nick Lupi:]
Two hands are what we made it with
A labour of love and long days with it
Writing the score and setting the stage
Product of the very same pavement that plotted the gradient
If I could get a taste of it, I could run away with it
I recall vividly the infamy attained
The names that rang out through the halls that lifted me
Same imagery of fame, long reins had little me
Trying to write my timpanis into the same symphony
Footsteps of kings in my neighbourhood streets
The legendary crews and the fabled old beefs
We were coming up quick trying to figure our piece
My best friends and I, no limit to the reach
You can see it in my eyes, I can't hide the pride
And privilege I feel standing right beside 'em
Theme music to the dream, the Oneday team
And it won't stop till that one day's seen, y'knahmean?

[Repeat Chorus:]
