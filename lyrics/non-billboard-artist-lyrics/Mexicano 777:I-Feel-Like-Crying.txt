I-Feel-Like-Crying:Mexicano 777
You know, Domingo
This muthafuckers shit I'm tired
Muthafuckers from out of here
Said they're Puertorican
Que son boricuas,
Que son de la isla
This muthafuckers don't even know about?
You know what?
I'm tired of this muthafuckers from Puerto Rico
Said they're from Brooklyn,?
New Jersey, the Bronx
Muthafuckers never left
The mutahfuckins mountains
Nunca han dejado las monta√±as,
Nunca se han montado en un avion
chorro de cabrones, Keep it real!
I feel like crying
Cause I see my brother falling down
Tears upon his face
As his body hits the ground
Remembering the old times
When we used to hang
Snuffin' nigga's up and down
Cause him and me,
We were the same
But nothing seems to be the same
He thought it was a game
Now I've got the blame
Because my nigga had no shame
Bullets have no heart
When it penetrates your brain
And it takes to a place
Where you've never been before
You can't come back because
Somebody slammed your door
Look around the floor
Cause I know you see fire
Hope to God for mercy
And next time don't be a liar
Be for real,
Cause a real nigga never dies
Now I know who love's me
Just by looking at their eyes
Life has treated me so bad, son
Sometimes I look happy,
Sometimes I look sad
I feel frustration,
Bringing to my blood some elevation
I'm cursing at the devil
Cause the devil brought temptation
To my brother
And now he's dead,
There is no other,
Mexicanos in the house
So nigga run for cover
I feel like crying
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Cause I see my brother falling down
Tears upon his face
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
As his body hits the ground
Remembering the old times
When we used to hang
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Me and my brother,
Me and my brother
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho) (Repeat 2X)

Ain't trying to fake the funk
Like a punk fakes his move
You loose!
Cause you came out bloody in the news
Now they come to me and say
Phantom you're all that!
Your pockets are always fat
And take it as a fact
My father used to whip me
Cause I hang around with blacks
I didn't give a fuck!
I told him what was up?
He made me knuckle up and from
The blues gave me a smack
I gave my father slack
He changed it for a slap
So my Puerto Rican family came
And put him on his back
You racist mother fucker
Take a long, long nap,
Take a long, long nap
So now, my mother sees me bad
Cause she ain't got her man
I'm seeing tears in her eyes
But I don't really give a damn
I ain't trying to be cold blooded
But my father was not a man
So she ran out my life
And my heart is beating quick
My heart is not a brick
And man, I feel like if I'm dying
But I'm still alive
So for now I feel like crying
I feel like crying
Cause I see my father falling down
I feel like crying
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Cause I see my father falling down
Tears upon his face
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
As his body hits the ground
Remembering the old times
When we used to hang,
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Me and my poppa,
Me and my poppa
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
Yo time flew fast
And I forgot about the past
I desired for a woman that
I knew our love would last
Someone nice,
So we could do a big splash
Take her to my crib
Where it's safe for her to crash
Not thinking about the cash
Like if I was a hundred-dollar bill
Wanting to change my life
Sitting back, relax and chill
I know I'm dazing off 'cause
That love is hard to get
Someone that could care
And make love to me in bed
I think that's something
That money can't buy
I ask myself "Why"?
Is it that nobody calls?
I want to be like Big Pun
So you can call me Big Papa
Walking with 2Pac
Motherfuckers y que pasa
I feel like crying
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Cause I see my sister falling down
Tears upon her face
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
As her body hits the ground
Remembering the old times
When we used to hang
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Me and my sister,
Me and my sister
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
I feel like crying
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Cause I see my brother falling down
Tears upon his face
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
As his body hits the ground
Remembering the old times
When we used to hang,
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Me and my brother,
Me and my brother
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
I feel like crying
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Cause I see my father falling down
Tears upon his face
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
As his body hits the ground
Remembering the old times
When we used to hang,
(heyyaheyyaheyyahey)
Me and my poppa,
Me and my poppa
(heyyaheyyaheyyaho)
