People Dieing, drive-bying,

[Verse 1]
Hey yo come around my way
Daily cross the bridge
They hustle, they grinding
And they tussle, they struggle, they fighting
They muscle their weight ’till the top no [?] and no crying
They put the fire in the poets they flo and they rimming
They writing, they focused, they know what they glow and they shinning
So dopin and open and they locke and they smoke and they drink
They hope to be singing and balling is all that you think?
They ripping off your chain, they tripping, they cripping and they banging
They throwing up flames dipping and flipping the slang
They claiming blocks that don’t own a dime for
They taking shots to [?] so we writing for ‘em
To make ‘em stop for a second ’cause everyone hurts
If I can give ‘em a record I give ‘em one verse
I try to inspire, they surviving, they’re not living
You can’t make a prediction, the future is not written
All doe I’m not a fizician, I try to stop and listen
It’s like we got a condition
Word!

[Verse 2]
Homie I’m Mack Maine! Chia!
I’m from the city where the babies killing babies
And the babies having babies ain’t no if, as and maybes
All the past this is crazy, the baby momma’s lazy
The congregation seem like they suffering from constipation
But since [?] seem like they on that slow s**t
N****s from my hood holla we ain’t ’bout that old s**t
Soon as the beef jump off n****s put they’re glock up
And ride around [?] block up
Uh, its for the youngest practice prostitution
And the n****s don’t give a f**k about the constitution
They say Abe Lincoln freed the slaves
But honestly homie we still slaves if we don’t behave
Ever since katrina my n****s ain’t got sense
Any ain’t got [?], but they all got guns
Wassup America give back to the hood
You m***********s put crack in the hood
That’s why

[Verse 3]
For you to call me a street n***a just for acuzation
You probably calculating
The fact I be with them workers without that application
Making money in the city I’m from
From grinding until they get us tired and stop the racing
Our actions is afirmative, come get the affirmation
What are my odds speaking to move mountains like The Appalachians
Victims for circumstance
Not stopping until the whole block flooding like [?]
N****s [?]
Violence everyday in they’re lives like knowledge
So they go out and get street smart despite college
Yep, the wrong mind frame, but the right wallet
You listening to the heart of the city
I’m heart of the greedy this place you can visit
N****s even feel the mayor, sprayer
Then go somewhere and weight up to their weighter
A bunch of us from are not millionaires
