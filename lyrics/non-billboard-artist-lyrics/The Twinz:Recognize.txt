Recognize:The Twinz
The place is here, the time is right
For the Twinz and Warren G to rip shit tonight, right
Hold on tight to your seat, comin' from the city that's low
Urban life near the beach peep

So come one, come all, fall into my smooth flow
It's the trip L O double C yo
The game is trump tight, ain't no need for you to boo me
'Cuz after it's over, all you hoes goin' wanna do me

It's part of the plan to get mine from the jump
G-Dub hooked it up, so you know it's gotta straight bump
A typical day on the eastside a lot of gangstas buck mouths
And brothas slangin' bean pies

But that's how it goes in the city where I was born
Familys mourn, niggaz slippin', never gettin' born
So that's why you gotta stay alert
'Cuz everyday somebody's out, there tryin' to put in a little work

For the hood, or just on the solo
Walkin' in Long Beach real late is a no no
But don't let me scare you, you do what you gotta do
Respect is a must, checkin' niggaz that try to check you

Y'alls niggaz better recognize
Focus your eyes 'cuz my homey's high
Y'alls niggaz better recognize
E-E-E-E-Eastside

Tick, tock, tickin' to the era
It's Warren G with the Twinz Funk era
N to the A to the T to the E
The S to the N to the double O P

I'm a take you on a trip, so beat the game I display man
I run it to you in a gangsta kinda way
It's all good when you dealin' wit tha locc
Stilll blazed the smoke wit the homies and the kin-folk

And ain't no nigga gonna be takin' mine
I'm servin' niggaz with a quicka picka up and on as a nine
So if you really wanna watch this trigga flow
It's kinda itchy but I know I shoulda pulled it long time ago

'Cuz I be connectin' like dot to dot
So when it gets hot well I gotta shake the spot
And move to that other level see
Wayniac comin' through in '94 L B C

Y'alls niggaz better recognize
Focus your eyes 'cuz my homey's high
Y'alls niggaz better recognize
E-E-E-E-Eastside

Now you know the game and the game's complete
Why's that? Because the twinz are bringin' nuthin' but heat
And ya know you didn't wanna see the Cavi flow
What kinda flow? The kinda flow that makes you slow ya roll

So open your eyes and pay attention
It's two of my homies on a muthafuckin' mission
And I, kicks up dust 'cuz it's a must
And I, acts a fool 'cuz it's my rule

So need we say more on this topic, Warren G dropped it
Put it in track and we locked it
Nigga did I rock it? Nigga did I rock it?
It really doesn't matter 'cuz it's still only poppin'

Y'alls niggaz better recognize
Focus your eyes 'cuz my homey's high
Y'alls niggaz better recognize
E-E-E-E-Eastside

Y'alls niggaz better recognize
Focus your eyes 'cuz my homey's high
Y'alls niggaz better recognize
E-E-E-E-Eastside till I die
