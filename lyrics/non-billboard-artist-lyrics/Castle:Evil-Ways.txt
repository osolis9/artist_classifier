Evil-Ways:Castle
Superstitions got the best of me
Can't control the world I see
Evil eyes, Evil ways

Ride
Evil ways

Paranoia's got a hold of me
Captured under lock and key
Wicked lies, wicked ways
Dancing on your grave

Premonition of the third degree
Night terrors in all my dreams
Straight away to hell and back
When the mirror runs black you'll know
