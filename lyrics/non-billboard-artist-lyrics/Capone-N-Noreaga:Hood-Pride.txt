2 Capone

Drug money and slum
Got niggas sellin' buzz downs
Same dude with the 5 is on the bus now
Tryna get it transfer for 2 more rides
Im the goon ho killed your mom for a Q45
Why niggas keep asking the question
They got the answer to 'em
The bullets do the same thing to you
that the cancer do
I never bring death to nigga until he cross me
Never take nigga too serious when he's saucy
In the branch when i'll die
they'll build me a mausoleum
and i'll stay with the couture couture
and blast for my freedom
We livin' lawless flawless diamonds
Pockets fat like Rick Ross's
Haters move cautious
Nicotin flow they addicted and get nauseous
22 spendin' on a pan of mary porches
You can say the rockers is for the young and the restless
This is for the coke cowboys get your guns and your vestes???????????????
