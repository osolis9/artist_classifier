Roll, roll, roll, roll,
Roll, roll, roll, rock and roll. Roll, roll...
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, rock N roll, roll, roll

When we hit the town we paint that red.
Standing on tables and kicking down chairs,
'Cause that's just rock and roll.
That's just rock and rollll.
My credit don't crunch, my swaggers insane.
No blue suede shoes,
Just my Adidas trainers but I'm still rock and roll.
Lord knows I'm rock and roll. ROCK...

Drums. Bass pain ppppills Girls.
Drink. Every weekend. Raves.
Dances. Clubs ships.
That's why they all wanna come backstage.
I said that's why they all wanna come back stage stage stage

Nigga I'm a rock a rock and roller.
I'm for real Don't need the persona.
Ye, I put on a show like Oprah.
Still drunk off the brandy and cola.
Lord knows I'm Elvis of the scene.
Call me a craze I'm a legend in the East.
There's no point stepping next to me 'cause your out
Of your depth like a leopard in the sea.
And I ain't got no guitar but I come like a Jimmy Hendrix
The board nose Kano is slick so police don't need no
Forensics

Then I get to the town with my dulux paint boo stray
