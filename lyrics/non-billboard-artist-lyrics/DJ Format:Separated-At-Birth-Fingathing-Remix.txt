Separated-At-Birth-Fingathing-Remix:DJ Format
Well hello, hey, top of the morn', bonjour
bueno Dias, I got the water,
heres a teabag
format we need three cups
plus sugar milk, A few spoons
to stir it all up
but be careful, sh! t is hot, like lava
hotter than a fat fuck, jogging in a sauna
hotter than eating a jalapeno pepper
straight out the jar, in a flaming car
me and ab diggy be raising bars
straight slaughtering snares, kicks, high hats and bass guitars
While your record is a waste of paper, ink, and breaks
your getting no play like Clay Aiken's balls
no play, similar to self hating hermaphrodites
the slice of abdominal busts raps so tight
borat says: its like innards of young bulls
girls screaming like there vibrating tongue tools

Chorus…
we're separated at birth
that's demonstrated in the verse
its orchestrated and rehearsed
abs and d on stage we go to work
the spectators go berserk
when we be saying these words
the records playing in the blurb
format with beats that make ya neck turn

turn the mic's up, turn the lights down
turning wax on the table supplies the sound
B-boys turning on the ground
probably keep turning till the earth stops turning around
now I'm guessing
its refreshing
to be checking
emcees of this calibre
gripping the mic tight like Arthur did Excalibur
serve format of the round tables
With abs and d its like the stuff found in fables
fuck entertainment
D and A-B go invade the stage
and rain more than? Reiner?
Fuck rain we're more than rain,
we're hail so hail hip hops hottest pair
of Canadian rhyme Sages
and the UK's hottest beat maker slash
the hottest fingertips to ever grace the record player
basically the hottest trio
bringing beats and flows
hotter than a cool walk or steaming toes

chorus…

All format wanted was a little ditty
he could spin his shindig
so he said “D-siggy
you got anything to give me”
So I scribbled on a piece of tissue
with a pencil and scripted
the illest lyric
ever written
in the history of fingers
over this beat with the flute loop
get loose
shoot the gift of gab
abs
smooth like a baby in a zoot suit
more flavour than a bowl of fruit loops
your style's what comes out my poop shoot
played like wearing true boots
and it's a stupid move
to try to foolishly prove
anything to these two super dudes
Your due to conclude
its no use
like trying to shoot hoops
versus midgets
zooted off of glue fumes
your styles like white people
wearing moo moo's
by fubu
? wear? pens is praising zoo loo
confused to
say the least even your crew new
that you'd loose before this tune
was through dude

chorus…
