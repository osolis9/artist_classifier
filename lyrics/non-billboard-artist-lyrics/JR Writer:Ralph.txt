Ralph:JR Writer
Im wide awoke, whats poppin yo
Beside the clip in my pocket, hoe (blaow)
A rocket blow, it's adios
We wanna stay but it's time to go (it's time to go)
Niggas Alpo, not Alpo, but we Alpo (dog food)
Keep telling us you coming out with your own shit
But it ain't Ralph, though (Let's go)

I'm about dough, I be wild low
With the loud rolled, that tical flow
Getting wild blow, how you style those?
Oh, you made that? Cute. It ain't Ralph, though
But your house closed, I’ll have you hostage 
At your own household, Nigga, that's house hold
This is Kimbo with a little Valbo
I turn the intro right into an outro
Lyrically crawling, nigga, we balling
Gonna take all the gauchos
Nigga, meet Jordan, I'm finna keep scoring
In my Ralph Lauren houserobe how the bounce flow
I live the high life, roll the high lights
Where the smell go? What's indo’ to a little outdo?
I know you think so but it ain't Ralph, though

chorus

It's the get right, I don't think twice
I just live life so it's been like
And I been nice, don't you rip mics
Every time the kid right I got pen stripes
Whats your pen like, Keep your mouth closed
Nigga, not a sound spoke when you come around pros
Hold up in the mix, caught up in the riff
Polo on your fifth, but it ain't Ralph, though
Hit the clown note, all you do is brown nose
Got the low down, all you niggas down low
I get high fives when they bring around hoes
No Wi-Fi, all they do is download
Fax I’m a G, 
You ain't even half of a key, When you cats gonna flee?
You know the model, that ain't even Ralph, though
More like Polo assassin to me
