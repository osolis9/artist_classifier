Glow-So-Hard:E-TRAIN
Ive never seen it glow so hard from space

Fresh yes I'm a 80's babe
Old school no bathing ape
Riding in Mercedes sleigh
doe boy
crazy cake
every since my training day
I been gone forever beaming
strobe light
Super slow
city lights

glow like a solar flair
sky box
owners chair
penthouse
time square
private plane we almost there
breezing south the weather's scenic
leaving clouds i've never needed
me im out
window seat
i see my house

im kicking it
lip service
ridiculous but deserve it
invincible im determined
life's cyclical so im learning
change for the best rehearse it
leave fate for the best and work it
payday to the Train its urgent...
