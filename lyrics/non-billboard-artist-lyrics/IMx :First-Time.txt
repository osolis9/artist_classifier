See, normally a brother wouldn't talk about his first time 
But I'll just be real with y'all and say what's on my mind 
I remember like yesterday, just a little man 
I Had no clue, just quite, didn't understand 
Look up to big bro for a little advice 
He said "Young boy" whatever you do just, make sure you straped twice" 
I was a little bit nervous about being my first time 
But I said "What the hell this girl is too damn fine" 

[Chorus] 
My very first time 
In the house, on the couch, in your parents' bedroom remember 
My very first time 
And I Wait 'til the day when I see you again remember 
My very first time 
It was just as special to me that it was to you girl 
My very first time 
Will never forget my first time 

See it was sunday afternoon, mom and pop were gone 
We have to be on the low cuz they were on their way home 
We started kissing then it lead straight up to the bed 
I can't believe this is happenin' is what I'm thinking in my head 
Lasted like a minute but it seemed like forever 
We almost got caught but I was, too damn clever 
Your parents came home from church, and i was out of there drop of dime
Man I will never forget my first time 
This goes out to the first and you know who you are
I see you again (see you again) 
And no matter how old we both get no regrets I will never forget 
My first time 

[Chorus] 
My very first time 
In the house, on the couch, in your parents' bedroom remember 
My very first time 
And I can't Wait 'til the day when I see you again remember 
My very first time me, it was just as special to me as it was to you girl
Will never forget my first time 

see some of you might have started early,some of you started late
but I when i started,and i thought it was great
This goes out to all my little brothers in the world
Make sure your first time is with that special girl

Clap your hands if you remember your first time, your first time 
Clap your hands if you remeber your first time, your first time baby

[Chorus x2]
My very first time 
In the house, on the couch, in your parents' bedroom remember 
My very first time 
I can't Wait 'til the day when I see you again remember 
My very first time 
It was just that special to me that it was to you girl 
My very first time 
(after 2nd time)
I Will never forget my first time
and I will never forget
and I will never forget
My first time
