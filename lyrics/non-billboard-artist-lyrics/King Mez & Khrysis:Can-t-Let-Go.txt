Can-t-Let-Go:King Mez & Khrysis
If you wonder where I’ve been
I came back to let you know
I got room for you 
And I can’t let go

All my niggaz do
...Ain’t a nigga gonna say for you,girl
You wanna knmow if that’s the tip,huh?
You should probaly wave a tech
I wonder what you expect from a nigga that you neglect
BMW cast in Nevada
I should ...tryin’ a way to sin
Honda can’t help you to do this ,nada
A nigga is hit with the dawn
And this is nada
But I love my nigga
I love my nigga acting like me
And we drug dealers is all you gonna see
We drug dealers don’t understand
Some other love,but we’re smart though
Whatever,you’re my heart though
This fillin’ didn’t really do the job though
And I can’t let go,and I can’t let go
And I can’t let go
I wonder why we can’t let go
And I can’t let go,and I can’t let go
And I can’t let go
I wonder why we can’t let go
Niggaz can’t let go
No,I can’t let go
Wonder why we can’t let go
And we can’t let go

Okay,I’m getting ready
What’s the graduate region?
Especially when they own a neighborhood inside to feed it
What money do you have?
I bet they got you
Brother,with a light weapon,I bet they shot you
This is with respect
I got to let they search me
Talk about friend,but I feel like you judge me
You’re keeping it really thirsty
You should give me some mercy
We could definitely do better
I know that and it hurts
Cool as my momma made me
Our judges can’t fit
I see those choppers,and I can’t picture them
And then I’m just hoppin’ as soon as the flames start
Try not to remember our last song 
Yeah,follow,follow,all my niggaz follow
Try not to remember our last song 
Yeah,follow,follow,all my niggaz follow
