Come Be my guest, but don't suggest to me
That I should give up and go after money

the perfect time to be what you wanna be,
cause everytime i see someone trying these,
stupid fucking dreams, it really always seems,
they won't achieve a single single thing,
but for me i'll be the motherfucking king
