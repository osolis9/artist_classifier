Brush:Phlake
Everybody's off
Everybody's lonely
Everybody knows
Everybody's lonely

Sometimes, I need your touch
Paint me pictures, I'll be your brush
Paint me pictures, please don't rush
Paint me pictures, paint me pictures

I'm trying to be here
But I'm really not here
I'm trying to be sincere
But everything is unclear
I always overthink
Never 'bout the right things
I wonder what I'm missing

Take me to your mind
You're my natural high
Turning our phones off for the night
I don't want nothing in my eyes, but your eyes

Everybody's off
Everybody's lonely
Everybody knows
Everybody's lonely

Sometimes, I need your touch
Paint me pictures, I'll be your brush
Paint me pictures, please don't rush
Paint me pictures, paint me pictures

Something I can feel
Something we can both feel
I want it to be real
I don't know how to be real
This space I'm living in
Never the place I'm in
I'm fading out and in

Take me to your mind
You're my natural high
Let me end where you begin
I don't want nothing on my skin but your skin

Sometimes, I need your touch
Paint me pictures, I'll be your brush
Paint me pictures, please don't rush
Paint me pictures, paint me pictures

Don't know what we're looking for
Chasing after more and more
Acting like we got no choice
Just tryna filter out the noise

Everybody's off
Everybody's lonely
Everybody knows
Everybody's lonely

Sometimes, I need your touch
Paint me pictures, I'll be your brush
Paint me pictures, please don't rush
Paint me pictures, paint me pictures

I need your touch
Paint me pictures, I'll be your brush
Paint me pictures, please don't rush
Paint me pictures, paint me pictures
Paint me pictures, I need your touch
Paint me pictures, I'll be your brush
Paint me pictures, please don't rush
Paint me pictures, paint me pictures

Paint me pictures
