Meet-Me-At-The-Corner-Diplomats:The Diplomats
At a quarter to 8
Meet me on the corner baby
Make it a date
Underneath the old clock
We'll go where there's dancing
And we'll make the joint rock
I'll be waiting for you baby
Don't you be late
Oh meet me on the corner
At a quarter to 8

For a long time I've been waiting
For the time when we'd start dating
Can't blame me for celebrating
I'm letting everyone know

So come on
At a quarter to 8
Meet me on the corner baby
Make it a date
We'll eat at a diner
And then after we're fed
We'll get out our brushes
And we'll paint the town red
I'll be waiting for you baby
Don't you be late
Oh meet me on the corner
At a quarter to 8

For a long time I've been waiting
For the night when we'd start dating
Can't blame me for celebrating
I'm letting everyone know

So come on
At a quarter to 8
Meet me on the corner baby
Make it a date
We'll eat at a diner
And then after we're fed
We'll get out our brushes
And we'll paint the town red
I'll be waiting for you baby
Don't you be late
I'll be waitin' on the corner
Won't you meet me on the corner
At a quarter to 8
And don't you be 5 minutes late now
