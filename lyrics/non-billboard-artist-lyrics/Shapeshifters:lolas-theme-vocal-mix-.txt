Oooh yeah

Looking back
I know I was walking around in disguise
Deep inside
I was just a lost soul I needed a guide

And the moment that you came to change my life
You fired up my heart and made me smile
You and I know that

I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
Turn my world around, world around

Things I had
All faded away by the minute and hour
Feel alive 
You untwisted all of my troubles inside

Like a little piece of heaven finally found
You refilled my heart up from the ground
And you and I know that

I'm a different person, yeah
turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
turn my world around
(oh yeah yeah)
I'm a different person, yeah
turn my world around
(turn my world around)
I'm a different person, yeah
turn my world around, world around

Ooh yeah yeah

Ooooh you fired up my heart and made me smile
And you and i know that

Turn my world around
Ooh yeah yeah

I'm a different person, yeah
turn my world around
(turn my world around)
I'm a different person, yeah
(ooh yeah yeah)
turn my world around
I'm a different person, yeah
turn my world around, world around
