Hurts-The-Most:E-Money Bags
Woke up one morning and I'm feeling good
Misunderstood, I'm fucking king pin in my neighbourhood
I'm getting money with my niggas
The young guns, time to bust pull their fucking triggas
It figures, the phone rang, I'ma bring some bad news
Tellin' from the tone of his voice my nigga had the blues
Saying such and such call it what you want shots in his body was discovered by the cops
The phone dropped, my brain locked in shock
Started smoking mad weed but the pain wouldn't stop
My nigga, they took my nigga, but fuck that
We going on a hunt and when I find him I'm a buck that
Fool 'til he drool and he croak
I'm runnin' on his block nigga watch the Glock smoke
Provoke the hit shit I want my vengance
Then I skid off and get away with my intelligance
And then back around the way it's so cold for you
Uh, gunshots to my fallen crew

When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!

Revenge is sweet, on the streets, understand me
Gotta retaliate and get it straight, locate the niggaz family
And I'm rollin' in my jeep, top speed
Ready to pull the trigger
On any bitch ass nigga, who got weed
They killed my homie and I'm restless
Gotta get 'em back, a nigga with a mak and a deathwish
Tears in my eyes don't cry
Look up to the sky and wonder why
Do everybody gotta die?
Another soulja in a casket
Can't eat, can't sleep, 'til I, bury them bastards
His family is fallin' to pieces
His momma don't understand the madness, I can't explain the drama
And it hurts the most, when someone close
I smoke weed, cause I'm losing hope
And any dope can see, the ghettos fulla drug dealers
But aint nobody born a killa, but it hurts the most

When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!

One man, drowing in the quick sand
Put my nigga down with my full proof plan
On the other avenues that we tried was blocked
So it's time to put in work with the 10 milly plot
And in no time flat, had the fucking money sack
I'm a guard it all a hundred G's in my arms
All thanks to my nigga
Who took the most risk, even though I was a little bigger
I thought it would be alright
Just bust another right and get ghost down a turn pright
But a fucking pig cut him off
My nigga won't soft, he let his 9 off
And that will be the only way I'll take it
Filled him full of led and I'm raising his babies
Now the money don't come close
Cus when a friend dies it hurts the most me, live the thug life

When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
Boom boom boom got me shootin' at a ghost!
When your nigga dies it hurts the most...
