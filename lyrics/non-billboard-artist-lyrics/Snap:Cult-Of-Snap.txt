-** Cult Of Snap **-


   To my knowledge the lyrics should be correct..

      'Bullets Drop to the ground and sirens ring,
	      While rich men keep doin' their thing..'

	 		                      Mc Kill (Australia)


			Groove is quick but thick no trick
			words manifest
			Lyrics I lick
			(hype as hype and SNAP made it hyper)
			Beat to the brain like a bullet from a sniper
			When the loser smooth like a cruiser
			Beat the beat down
			I'm the big bruiser
			On to off to off on and on
			This is the new-new breed of rap song
			to the T.O.P yes the top
			I rock the spot hot
			To be or not to be yes it'll be
			M.C. Turbo B
			(yes to the groove yes it's party)
			Peace of mind
			Time to unwind
			Trip and dip slip the hip now grip
			To the Techno House of hip
			('cause this is the cult of SNAP)

			Hard to hold
			it's burning cold
			We make the jam broke the mold
			so it can't be sold
			Took the vic
			Stolen taken
			Move to the groove
			Dancefloor shakin'
			Up and down you're spinning around
			You check the sound, hands in the air
			Feet on the ground
			Party Hard, Hard not to party moving close
			(body to body)

			I for one the only son the only child
			not mild but the kid is wild
			Code name is Turbo
			Jam,jump,jump,jump,jump and jam
			The cult of SNAP 
   			And snap is in command
			To the point correct and exact
			THIS IS THE CULT OF SNAP
