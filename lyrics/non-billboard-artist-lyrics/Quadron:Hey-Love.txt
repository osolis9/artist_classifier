Hey-Love:Quadron
Hey love, what's going on in here?
You're ruthless like a stone
Hey love, why you don't seem to care?
It's to you I belong
Trying my best not to make this an insult
But blaming you I despair
But hey love, what's going on in here?
You brutalize my soul

Promise the best is yet to come
Oh, please tell me the truth
When will the two of us be one?
Oh, please tell me the truth
So I can prove that I'm the one
I'll prove that I'm the one
I'll prove that I'm the one
I'll prove
Oh, please tell me the truth
So I can prove that I'm the one

Hey love, I've been a sad affair
And restless for your charm
Hey love, do you really think it's fair?
This search, it's been so long
Crying for reasons, and try to believe
That I'm too young to fall in love
But hey love, what's going on in here?
You brutalize my soul

Promise the best is yet to come
Oh, please tell me the truth
When will the two of us be one?
Oh, please tell me the truth
So I can prove that I'm the one
I'll prove that I'm the one
I'll prove that I'm the one
I'll prove
Oh, please tell me the truth
So I can prove that I'm the one

But if you really want my life
You got to show me
Only me waiting in the dark for you

Promise the best is yet to come
Oh, please tell me the truth
When will the two of us be one?
Oh, please tell me the truth
So I can prove that I'm the one
I'll prove that I'm the one
I'll prove that I'm the one
I'll prove
Oh, please tell me the truth
So I can prove that I'm the one
