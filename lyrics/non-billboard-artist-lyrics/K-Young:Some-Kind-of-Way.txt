Some-Kind-of-Way:K-Young
Usually I’m popping Rick Ross,
But lately I’ve been rolling out that loute of van drop
Thinking about you, you.

And the flavor of your lip-gloss
I saw it in the couple walking down the sidewalk,
Thinking about you.

And how you have me miss you like that,
Put that on me, had me coming right back.
Every time you go down, down, down,
Down, down, down.

I’m feeling some kind of way,
I’m feeling some kind of way, girl,
I really would try to get to your time.
I’m feeling some kind of way,
I’m feeling some kind of way,
I know what I think, but I’m saying something different now.

No money, I be with a dozen quicks at the same damn time,
When you did your dance on his dick, girl, you made a nigger flip.
Maybe I’ve been layed up with your sexy ass all night.

And how you have me miss you like that,
Put that on me, had me coming right back.
Every time you go down, down, down,
Down, down, down.

I’m feeling some kind of way,
I’m feeling some kind of way, girl,
I really would try to get to your time.
I’m feeling some kind of way,
I’m feeling some kind of way,
I know what I said, but I’m saying something different now.

And we both agreed that we wouldn’t get so serious,
But who would’ve known the sex will be so good?
Who would’ve known the sex will be so good?

I’m feeling some kind of way,
I’m feeling some kind of way, girl.
