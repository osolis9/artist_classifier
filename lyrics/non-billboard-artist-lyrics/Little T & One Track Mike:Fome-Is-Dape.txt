Fome-Is-Dape:Little T & One Track Mike
Slow hand, rubber band
Invitational grand prize
Ample voice box
Sensational mack

And the music's on vacation
Vocational
Past tense to present day
Cross-generational

Fome is dape, 21, honey
It ain't about the cred' and it ain't about the money
Where you at?
Where you been or where you from, from, from me
It just don't stop like the energizer bunny

Hip hop on the good foot everywhere you goin'
Fome is dape even when it's snowing
At the tippy-top or if you just tip-toein'
Let yo hair down, there's a big wind blowin'

When everyday feel like a party
Fome is dap
Eat yo fill, lick yo plate
Fome is dape, fome is dape

Candy bar,, superstar, easy to acquire
No dress code, Depeche Mode, ice-cold attire required
To be admired by the one you desire
If your mind wants to know, inquire

What the hell is fome?
It's dancin' 'round yo underwear, in your underwear
Playin' air guitar to a stadium of teddy bears
Or goin' to work, headphones on
Ignorin' what your boss says, singin' along

Dape, well that's another story
An adjective synonymous with absolute glory
Kinda like great, super, fly, hype, fresh
Bigger than big
(Huge)
Better than best

Wait a minute, I forgot to say somethin'
Fome is dape is kinda like jumpin'
Out an airplane with two cans of spray paint
To tag your name on the sky
A thousand feet high

With a parachute made of fresh fruit and French fries
Wearin' rubber boots to cover up the top of ya thighs
Surprise

Fome is dape is also a nice warm bubble bath
In the comfort of your own home
Foam
Get in

When everyday feel like a party
Fome is dape
Eat yo' fill, lick yo' plate
Fome is dape, fome is dape

When ya rollin' in the whip, fome is dape
Shootin' from the hip, fome is dape
Shakin' in the grass, fome is dape
Velocity or mass, fome is dape

Sippin' on a forty, fome is dape
Breakin' on ya shorty, fome is dape
Everybody on the planet, fome is dape
Ya gotta understand it, fome is dape

When everyday feel like a party
Fome is dape
Eat yo' fill, lick yo' plate
Fome is dape, fome is dape

Fome is dape
You better come check it
You wanna hear it again?
Buy the damn record

Play it ten times standin' on your head in bed
And I bet that you could get with every word that I said
Easy like that, greasy like fat
Little T never be cheesy like Jack

Mozzarella, Cheddar or American, baby
Fome is dape, the rest is all gravy

When everyday feel like a party
Fome is dape
Eat yo' fill, lick yo' plate
Fome is dape, fome is dape

When everyday feel like a party
Fome is dape
Eat yo' fill, lick yo' plate
Fome is dape, fome is dape

When everyday feel like a party
Fome is dape
Eat yo' fill, lick yo' plate
Fome is dape, fome is dape

Baseball, hot dogs
Social security, music
Fome is dape
