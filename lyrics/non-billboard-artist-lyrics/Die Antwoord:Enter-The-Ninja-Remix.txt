Enter-The-Ninja-Remix:Die Antwoord
[Yo-Landi Visser]

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I'm a ninja, yo
My life is like a videogame
I maintain when I'm in the zone
One player one life on the mic
I'm in the dark

Go, ninja, go!

No f**kin around I'm cutting down
Anyone in my path
Tryna f**k up my game with razor sharp
Lyrical throw stars
Killin' my flow

Hos! Ska!
Wild, outta control

Ninja skop befokte rof taal
Rough rhymes, tough times
Met fokkol kos, skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast,
When you're living on the razor edge
Stay sharp, sharp
Rolling with the $O$
High energy
Never seen zef so fresh
Uh, when we mic check
Hi-Def flow's flex
Yo we optimistic
Not f**king depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can't f**k with my new Zef flow
I'm hard to miss
"You can't do this, you can't do that"
Yo, f**kin' who said so?
I do what I like
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
You can't f**k with the chosen one
I-I-I-I-I want the knife
I'm a Ninja

[Yo-Landi Visser]

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Ninja is poes cool
But don't f**k with my game
Boy or I'll poes you
Life is tough
When I get stuck
When my time is up
I push through
Till I break-break-break
on through to the other side

Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker

Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain
Its not sore
Don't ask for kak or
You'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive
My blade swing free
Decapitate a hater with amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic sabre like a wild f**king savage
from the dark side danger
Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek Ninja's
Motherf**king big in Japan
I seen the future, but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja

[Yo-Landi Visser]

I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

[Ninja]

f**k, this is like
The coolest song I ever heard in my whole life
f**k all of you who said I wouldn't make it
Who said I was a loser
Said I was a no-one
Said I was a f**kin' psycho
But look at me now:
