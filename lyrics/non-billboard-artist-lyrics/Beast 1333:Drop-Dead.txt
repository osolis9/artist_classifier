Drop-Dead:Beast 1333
I'll sucker a punch a pig
stab him in the neck first
If i see he big
snap em twig
Happy dance a jig
to shovel tell him dig
Dig he dug
messing with them drugs
I had to pull the plug
smoke a dub
Now the bodies grub for all the desert bugs
think you're thug?
When i let my mind roam into places dark
my brain and heart
Remain in flame and spark
the pain of Satans bark
Forsaken shark
that latching on and shaking
Tons of flesh and meat
your bitch in heat
She jerking with her feet
discreet, she's street complete
Uniquely greet
and shake the hand of every motherfucker here
Don't interfere, i see you're insincere
its clear you're full of fear
And as you freeze
i'll kick you in the stomach
Drop you to your knees
smoke all your trees
Hence forth i do decree
you're whooped by 33
The name is B E A S T
dont test me
Your wack music and your whole team
fail to impress me
I live my rhymes
Reflection all the time
of what is on my mind
I'm on my grind
i write a couple lines
as soons i rise and shine
My mic's divine
i didn't mean to wake you with my frigid slap
You're less than crap
the Beast is always strapped
a wrap, don't give me dap
My semi clap
clunk and click and clack
Until the clip is scrapped
go take a nap
Before you're in a sack
attack like Warren Sapp
I'll leave you dazed
cuz thats the type of brother
That my mother raised
hard to appraise
At first the name was Phase
you're grave as bullets grazed
You're sweet as glazed
and softer than a dozen dunkin krispy kreems
No Self Esteem
to you its just a dream
You're shitty as latrines
cant flush the bowl
Eliminate your soul
is now my major goal
Still on parole
i take complete control
When cold I'm on patrol
the pen'll scroll
Aint nothing as I'm screaming
yelling in your face
You're a disgrace
I'm raw as blunts thats laced
i'll put you in your place
A masters pace
your thinking and your rhyming's
Always kind of slow
watch out below
The bombs that i bestow
they manifest as flows
we've come to blows
And every single punch i land
feels like a brick
You think you're slick
you foreigners and hicks
Eclipsed by sickest spic
how any licks?
It takes to break you faggots all down to the core?
She begs for more
your mother wants to score
She stinky left a whore
my brother swore
And did without a care
together sand sweared
Since no one cared
that we will be the illest sibling human pair
You can't compare
i hope that you's aware
That you's is over there
i'll pull your hair
The fabric of space tear
wont share, cuz life aint fair
My stoic glare is menacing
you looked away but turned to stone
Bow to the throne
this payback like a loan
I've mastered pen and poem
my poems and pen
Are better than your best work
multiplied by ten
This is the end
no need to condescend
Pretend that you's a friend
i will ascend
On beats thats ill
i move in and i set up shop
Don't look so shocked
I'm ripping the microphone
and rapping till i drop
Im hip to hop
fuck hopping to whats hip
Don't trip or walk my block
you're shit is plops, go call the cops
and tell them
REVELATION DROPPED
