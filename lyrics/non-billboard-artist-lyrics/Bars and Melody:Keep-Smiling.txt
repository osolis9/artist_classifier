Keep-Smiling:Bars and Melody
Keep smiling keep smiling and we'll see what tomorrow brings
keep smiling keep smiling and be thankful for the little things
The sun is shining in the morning I get out bed

instead of being negative and thank the lord i aint dead
cuz i can do what i want and i can travel the world
and just maybe and while I'm doing it I might meet a girl
I live my life on a stage with a pen and a page
I follow all my dreams and I wouldn't have to care about a wage
but if it doesnt work out i keep a smile on my face
and ill be thankful for the fact that I got food on my plate
Keep smiling keep smiling and we'll see what tomorrow brings

keep smiling keep smiling and be thankful for the little things
cuz we wont be around forever so come on all lets join in together
keep smiling keep smiling and just remember all the good old days
I live everyday as it comes I breath the air through my lungs

I spent my pocket money then play the ps with my chums
if I didn't want the melody then forget about reality
id make a hit and id give all my earnings to a charity
people would be glad for me I would help out all my family
and depending on my mood weather I would change pethetic fallacy
playing footbal in the streets like my dad used to tell
back when everything seemed to run so well
Keep smiling keep smiling and we'll see what tomorrow brings
keep smiling keep smiling and be thankful for the little things

Cuz we wont be around forever so come on all lets join in together
keep smiling keep smiling and just remember all the good old days
were back to back you know its up to you
its amazing what a single friendly smile can do

never under estemate yourself or any others
cuz deep down were connected like sisters and brother
Keep smiling keep smiling and we'll see what tomorrow brings
keep smiling keep smiling and be thankful for the little things
cuz we wont be around forever so come on all lets join in together
keep smiling keep smiling and just remember all the good old days
