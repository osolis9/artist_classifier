I-Know-Didn-t-I-feat-Darondo-:DJ Nu-Mark
Listen
Now each and every day, I gave a bit more
Because in the game of love I held a high score
From the dinners and the movies and the things that didn't move me
But uh, sacrifice is what life's for
She had the big screen
(had that)
The diamond rings
(had that)
And dresses that showed about everything
(had that)
So we kept dippin' like wheels on the cadilliac
I wasn't trippin' though, I'd never take it back

And I know, and I know
And I wait, and I wait
And she won't, and she won't
To this day, to this day
And I know, and I know
And I wait, and I wait
And I would, and I would
But I can't, but I can't

Didn't I treat you right now?
(Didn't I...)
Didn't I do the best I could?
(Didn't I...)
Didn't I give you everything?
(Didn't I...)
Tried my best just to be man
(Darando: Didn't I...)
(Slimkid: So why'd ya do me this way?)

I'm so consistent with my heart, so consistent with my thought
That it's tearing me to pieces how you did me this way
It ain't about me winning, or all you givin' up to much
Now look at the environment you livin' in
My good intention shed light on my innocence
Girl, you kept pushin' on my ignorance
Where every word put me on the fence, I used to live like a prince, but never the king
In the castle you in girl, I gave you the ring, now that made you the queen above everything
I used to sing to myself I'm gon' be somebody, so I got to learn how to treat somebody
Wanna meet somebody that's open like me
Livin' in the moment girl hopin' life speaks to the rhythm of my heartbeat, pullin' out chords
Yeah, makin' love, that made us feel godly

Yeah, so true now

And I know, and I know
And I wait, and I wait
And she won't, and she won't
To this day, to this day
And I know, and I know
And I wait, and I wait
And I would, and I would
But I can't, but I can't

Uh
Uh huh
Yea

She used to blow me away, like a Gael force
And I was so sure, fairy had a tale for us
But doin' midstream, it took its own course
Had to walk it from here, beatin' the dead horse
I know that true love comes from a rare source
Cause mama told me, and now I'm real sure
Rich man without love means he's still poor
Always out there searchin' like there's more

And I know, and I know
And I wait, and I wait
And she won't, and she won't
To this day, to this day
And I know, and I know
And I wait, and I wait
And I would, and I would
But I can't, but I can't

Didn't I treat you right now?
(Didn't I...)
Didn't I do the best I could?
(Didn't I...)
Didn't I give you everything?
(Didn't I...)
Tried my best just to be man
(Didn't I...)

And I know.
