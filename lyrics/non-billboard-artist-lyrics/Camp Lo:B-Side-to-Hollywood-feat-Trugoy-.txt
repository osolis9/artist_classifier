B-Side-to-Hollywood-feat-Trugoy-:Camp Lo
Ay yo, watch that thing
Cause we coming around
Setting camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money money
Hollywood, money money sunshine
And everything fine
Ay yo, watch that thing
Cause we coming around
Setting camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money money
Hollywood, money money sunshine
It ain't gonna decline, so check it

Okay, now I'm gonna make this easy
We're gonna take this shit straight to your EP
Meet me with red carpet and some roses
And you knows this
Lovin'(?) makes them beat down for your fakin'
So catch these holly with hologram stands
While I'm bleekin'
And I be feekin'
De La thinks it's hot as he can(?)
And keep a sunny sorrow until this half of way goldie(?)
And now you've shown me
Niggas that do it like De La
Lay with Layla,?, livin' holiday Hilton
Stop lyin'
Stop denyin', stop the blood clot cryin'
Fresh like chef, want a slice
We heist and keep flyin'
Now I'm tyin' the ginger pessimist MC
Peace to Steve, Tristar, Big Mo, Snooze, and Julianne(?)

I say, Rickety Rocket was my favorite cartoon
And after marriage comes the honeymoon
Who love Popeye, is Alice the Goon
Ate the Honeycomb cereal with my big spoon
Woke up so late it was half past noon
Had to gather my connections and form a platoon
Niggas don't see it, but the war come soon
Dr. Imma(?) got the remedy
So son, stay tuned
And if I had a month to pick, it'd be June
I get up in your hide like Daniel Boone
Newspaper reads "Dove, #1 Tycoon"
Yo, we start up off this piece and give the next man room

I be kickin' like Bruce Li, Chinese Connection
Mamacita dig the cheeba
Satin complexion
Talkin' some shit
Like I'm relatives of Cassius?
Hear come the lower, with the meanie meanie
Come but, ain't you another slick on the flip city(?)
This shit, brickhouse, shit on my bed
Meet me copper, spoon in a loaf of bread, baby
Can I get a baby to go with the boom
And the bam, as long as the shit ain't sparin'
They closet the Camp
Right on Pam, when she do the splits(?)
So I can see cheeba's greatest hits

Yo, where the party at
With lower, lower
Yo, where the party at
With De La, De La
Yo, where the party at
With Trugoy, Trugoy
Yo, where the party at
With G-Suede, G-Suede
Yo, where the party at
With Cheeba, Cheeba
Yo, where the party at
With Maseo got jam(?)
Yo, where the party at
With Posdnuos
Or like, Jimmy Cracked Corn
