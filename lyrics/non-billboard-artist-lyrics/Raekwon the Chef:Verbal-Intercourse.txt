Verbal-Intercourse:Raekwon the Chef
No tricks, no tricks, baby
Yeah, aiyyo Rae, check it out y'all
It's the science, fly wonderful

Tony Starks and umm Lex Diamonds
Tony Starks, my nigga Nas
Strength my whole team is eatin off this type of shit
For all the fake niggaz out there, yaknahmean, word up
Good shit, nigga next time, no more whatever shit
Fakes be celebratin' but they be mistaken
Word to the wise
Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket

All types of shit, yo son
Rock it, RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggaz is the prophet
Tell em it's on right?
Show those crabs how to rhyme

It's only like five percent out of a hundred
RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggaz is the prophet
Do it to em baby

Through the lights, cameras and action, glamor glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets

Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom, with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm grungy but things I do is real it never haunts me

While funny style niggaz roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle
Holdin' weed inside they pussy with they minds on the
Pretty things in life, props is a true thug's wife

It's like a cycle, niggaz come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly that's the ritual

Perhaps, bullets bust niggaz discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends lickin' plates

In the building niggaz building, like little children starin'
Them older niggaz ain't carin'
Sirens circlin' fiends are lurkin' in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage

In the woodwork, crack cells bubble like Woolworth's
In the projects, richest niggaz rockin all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Tradin' in they Lexus' GS's sendin' messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew phantom like swords

With the green leathers, hundred pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things and it's wild like for war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks, yo, I hold

Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoe box
Don't keep jack in my lap, don't wanna see Tupac
Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop

In the Now, I'm bangin' niggaz for slide time
Hurry up, Duke, I'm next, show 'em mine
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat

Watch your back inside the hall, new niggaz slide through
Like doors yo, you're starin' in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindlin'
New jacks surrenderin', come home not rememberin'

Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Lookin' gay in the yard and you got hurt
Flashbacks for the day room, mop ringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed tryin' to turn the dial
You told your boo you was whylin'
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin

High class cooks, throw on vestes out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, "I got drugs"
Sharpen toothbrushes 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well, I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block

Strength my whole team is eatin' off this type of shit
Word up, throw your hands up
Good shit, nigga next time, no more whatever shit
Cock back the Mac an say whatever

Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket
Your Hawaiian's stale, exoticness, fly shit
RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggaz is the prophet
Floatin' on in nine-five in the basement
