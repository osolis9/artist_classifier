My-Team-SUPREME:Flatbush ZOMBiES
[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Today's agenda, a nation exterminating the pie-est
Pray that you never die, don't care to be deemed the highest
Our right is founded by liars, righteous by my suppliers
The wonder where my supply is (Nigga, where them beats?)
Fuck a feature my ether is equal to each of your own
Embodied the balance of the world on my shoulders alone
But God bless America, my G's go hard
G's make dreams and these grams make gods
I'm so compelled might as well reach another step
Never took the hells still fresh without them double X
Manson ransom artificial anthems
Ladies say you handsome, these niggas throwing tantrums
Tripping to existence is off the label in mistrius
Cause we position it different real hard to make sense of it
Record labels make sense, we sensitive
Now we're acting senseless, fuck you, architect for president

[Verse 2: Meech]
I'm on my freeze time leaping in and out of portal shit
You on your prick your finger from a thorn, mere mortal shit
I'm on my Heath Ledger, I can't get my mind in order shit
Get live at a bar mitzvah, portraits, slaughter shit
I am really that nigga call it quits get off my dick
Give the camera the finger every time I hear a flick
The code has been cracked and I'm the glitz, do you hear this shit
Like a rapping turd I swing on a track and serve
My rhyme scheme and my bars are finnit
I hear your shit and get a little narcoleptic
I admit your kind of boring, I was out touring
Stroking kittens with dimples that remind me of Lauren
London on thursday sunday I'm New Yorking
Brooklyn be the birthplace kings county caucus
Cut the malarkey yo-yo-you don't want no problem
The drama were zombies get off me
Some may say seeing him is like seeing god
See through all your transparency, oversee your facade
Dogs [?] like we paintings of them hounds playing poker
I'm Cesar Millan in the background taking notes
The potent, smoke up, hoes on my scrotum
Now the idle niggas always higher on the totem
I go son, headings like hooves get this one to blow us
With them colored code bullet holes on my...

[Hook]
My team supreme stay clean lyrical dreams, zombie regime
We be that, we at where the weed and LCD at
On since I was born no such thing as relapse
