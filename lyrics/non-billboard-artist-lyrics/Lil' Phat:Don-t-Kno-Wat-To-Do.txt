I'm livin the life of a grown man
Gotta keep my banga, keep it off safety, and watch alla my friends
Gotta take care of my mama kuz she hollin fuck a man
Gotta watch ova my brother kuz he with me till tha end
Gotta hold my daddy down he ain't got nobodi but Turk
Blankin shit fa lil Marcus until my body in the dirt
I think I need to go to church, dreamin ridin ina hearse
I wanna be with [? ] I only see him on a shirt
[? ] mama, she sick, I told him we can't lose another
Go tell Unique I love her, Ms. Shawn jus like a mother
Wish my uncle was next to me, but he in jail
So I chose him and send him pictures to show him how I live
And my life so real they got me lookin in my rear
You gotta be paranoid and careful when they wan' kill you
Sunday mornin newspaper and my daddy in it
The white folks want his money and we battlin it

[Hook:]
I'm steady smokin all these fools
Ion know what to do
But ian finna kill myself, I'm a leave that up to you
I'm a leave that up to you
{Neva do that} I'm a leave that up to you
I'm steady smokin all these fools
Ion know what to do
But ian finna kill myself, I'm a leave that up to you
I'm a leave that up to you
{Neva do that} I'm a leave that up to you

[Verse 2:]
Rest in peace Nick Sterling, you gone but not forgotten
Rest in peace Kevin Henderson, yo children, youngin got em
Mama, she straight, she safe, you ain't gotta worry
And I jus broke ha off daddy you ain't gotta hurry
Daddy, you shudda neva put me in that Bentley
Even though they hate on me but I still love my city
My thugs, yea they feel me, but my bloods wanna kill me
But these artists be hatin me too I ges that they ont hear me
So I leave my 40 cocked and I be ready to burn some
Jus one om in my belt so I be ready to earn some
Niggas wanna knock me off but still be callin my phone
No answer ian at home, I'm cum in aim at ya dome
A nigga burned one'a my cards up, why?, I'm comin harder
Or check one of my niggas if my mama outta water
I mean that, and I mean this from the heart
It's too late to be down if you wudn't with me from the start
