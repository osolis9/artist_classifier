Bad-Bad-Man:John Cena
Ah, you don' did it now
Chaos you should of put
This one in the vault man
They not ready
They don't know what's comin' man

Oh we gonna drop this on them right here
Y'all ain't ready for dis
Y'all ain't ready for none of dis

Your boy's a bad man
And we invadin' the streets
Make all 'em clapper-rappers scurred
They be droppin' the heat

Shocked the world now I'm standin' alone
I flip fools like them clamshell cellular phones
You can't help but nod ya head to the track
Fuck the watered-down rap, we be takin' it back

Give it to ya straight, ain't no chasin' it
Check ya self in the mirror, ain't no facin' it
'Cause you playin' the roll and you plannin' to fold
This the master plan, we got the planet on hold

We all over the streets like ya favorite sneaker
Breakin' up ya sound like a drive-thru speaker
Everything that I be spittin' is strong
After I rock, fast-forward through the rest of the song

We the monkey wrench
That's gonna ruin ya plan
And don't fuck wit John Cena
I'm a bad, bad man

With the mic in my hands, I'm a bad man
Even in the fight wit' my hands, I'm a bad man
Livin' in the streets all my life, I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

With the mic in my hands, I'm a bad man
Even in the fight wit' my hands, I'm a bad man
Livin' in the streets all my life, I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

We devils, rockin' ambient levels
We set loose among hot tunes to instrumentals
When cats got one-liners, I drop several
And I think it's funny you choose

Who's in progress of runnin' in place
We makin' rules and y'all settle
I rip rappers and take responsibility
For makin' future hall of famers look third-rate

Y'all are lost for words like
Conversation on your worst first-date
And raw beats creep through side streets
Loose leaf notepads, that's where rhymes leak

Punch-lines, man, don't even beg
I got knee-slapping tracks, y'all cruisin' ya leg
You a rhyme-writer, buddy? Man, that's a joke
You ain't worthy of being my secretary

Man, that's a quote
I flood tracks like cracks in boats
And pussy rappers choked up
Wit' they own rhymes in they throat

With the mic in my hands, I'm a bad man
Even in the fight wit' my hands, I'm a bad man
Livin' in the streets all my life, I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

With the mic in my hands, I'm a bad man
Even in the fight wit' my hands, I'm a bad man
Livin' in the streets all my life, I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

Turn up the microphone and feed me, I'm a beast
MCs and they beats is what I eat
16, I leave you in the street
My rhymes are sicker than gangrene in both feet

It's spreadin' up the leg and headin' for the head
Your rhymes are whack, your style is
Proof that the brain corrosion is fuckin' with ya chosen flows
I'm nice with mics, my hands'll break ya nose

Like Mikey Tyson, fightin' in his prime one rhyme
And I shake up the room one time, boom
To da jaw, your face is a cult-type, where all the
The blood is not bein' mixed, jelly on the floor

My love is Compton bricks, belly on the floor
I rob you, you soft and you really ain't a problem
I solve you, 3 57 long nose revolve you
Acid in ya face, bad look, dissolve you

I'm a bad, bad man, yeah, check it out
It's Bumpy Knuckles, baby
And I want you to say hello to the bad, bad man
Come on

With the mic in my hands, I'm a bad man
Even in the fight wit' my hands, I'm a bad man
Livin' in the streets all my life, I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

With the mic in my hands, I'm a bad man
Even in the fight wit' my hands, I'm a bad man
Livin' in the streets all my life, I'm a bad man
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man
