I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
I'ma make it back
Said I'ma throw this money
And I'ma make it back
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

[IamSu!]
Found [?]
You can hang with us baby but you cannot stay
Bitches love a nigga you would think I'm Dre
I told her throw it back for a R A C K
Don't stop get it get it one time for real
I know you got big dreams on your mind for real
I heard you trying to sing do wanna sign a deal
Or you wanna fall back just take your time and chill
I be out in New Orleans like please believe me
If you really fucking with me say Yeah like Jeezy
Ooh yeah, you like that I like that too
She got kicked out the club I brought her right back through
I got the juice like that, I could get away with murder
And if you ain't knowing you should go ahead and learn it
Burn it, hot shit cut it out like a surgeon
I'm splurgin on fly shit until the day that they bury me

I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)
I'ma make it back

And I'ma make it back
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

[2 Chainz]
My role model used to drive a Saab
Still got every chain I had from the store
Just a victim of identity theft
Them ho niggas, order Victoria Secret [?]
Figured your mom would have aged on
Money talk so I say song, play some
Why every time I do a feature, it feel like I ate some
Real shit, got the A locked with my rollie on the west coast
Call it bay watch, nigga they watch nigga
Put it in a safe box nigga
Put a fucking dread lock in her head
Throw this money, the trap my habitat
Woke up with money, cause I went to sleep with racks
Real shit

I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)

Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about

[Sage The Gemini]
This is why you know I'm the man
You say you hot but you ain't busting like a lava lamp
Breaking hoes hard to my B-Boy stance
Making this money Bye-Bye like the N-Sync dance
I be running in your mama like it's my last steps
And I'ma balling ass nigga bank with Max Preps
Ooh yeah, I'm from Seven oh Seven
Used to be on [?] from the 7-Eleven
You know she order it down for a mac
She make it jump like I'm holding on an iPhone app
Like holla, give her that brain [?]
Ride it like a skateboard going hard off this Rocket Power
Now this is only for family
Take your girl bring her back Friday like Stanley
The best french man but you will not [?] me
Racks on racks so you cannot ban me

I'ma throw this money (don't stop go crazy)

Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
Only that real shit, that's what I'm talking about
