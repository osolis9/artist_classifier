If-You-Should-Lose-Me:Lil' Rob
Orale
What's up ese, 
U know people try to  tell me how to do this
But I remain foolish 
Represent the brown to the fullest
That's rite 
So le me do things my way
Lil' Rob style
Ponle

I gotta go cuz I know that the jura is coming on after me
Gotta keep it cool, I don't wanna give em a reason for blasting me
Gotta get the fuck out, before the placa come and take me in
I'm in it to win it, let's begin, but God forgive me for all of my sins will win
I'm pulling my rhymes and having no time for anything else
Just call me the wicked with style, cuz I'm the vato dropping these playes 
Rocking the bells I'm the baddest seing is belivin 
It's Lil' Rob gangster, Simon the Diego Demon, screaming
Fiending for mine knocking down your door with the beats that hump and thump
Got the llesca y cerveza so that we can get fucked up
Now I'm feeling real good, not just good I'm feeling tipsy and dizzy
Some hynas come to my town and now they're asking "Who is he?"
Referring to me so, don't need permiso
"Can I get with you?" she said "Are you ready?" and I said "Estoy listo"
Pass me the pisto, then I want you to pass me my leño
I'm in love with Mary Jane, living life no mas y no menos
Man so, so don't even try to put me down cuz what comes around goes around
You see you try to put me down but I come up
Not giving a fuck if you hynas act stuck up
Cuz I get mine anyways, any days see when I do it I do it many ways
Many ways, anyways, now I jump in the ride, hit side to side
We slide and glide throwing up the Brown Pride
So you can keep running and running but I bet you can't hide
Because I'm on the prowl and now living life to the fullest
The foolish, is Lil' Rob happy? It can't be
And so they ask how I do this
Never ever letting nobody get me down but my smiling faces and cry later
Simon, I got shot in the face but I felt a pain that's much greater
Please, please don't make me tell you what it was
But I'll probably say when I'm buzzed
Now listen to what I bring
If you should lose me you'd lose a good thing

If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing
If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing

Simon, I'm the vato bringing the oldies straight from the past past
Cuz I'm that vato that wants to make them last last
So when I'm rolling through your town
Lemme hear my self bumping, thumping, and humping
Leaving you levas in shock as I pull the llesca from my sock
They call me Crypt Keeper cuz I'm selling reefer, they call grim reaper
Cuz if you want to mess around I could keep you in the forever sleeper
So when I start coming, you better start running
I'm the vato that's gunning
And as you levas fall to the ground and holmes I think it's funny
When I'm rolling down the block I think to myself ese
It takes nothing for me to slip and trip on
Oh God I gotta get a grip on life
Before I end up in a place where the veteranos told me not to go
Thought of this as a damn place and Valley of Chino
Gotta say what's up to my homeboy Dreamer
Who's dreams just really didnt' come true
Even though you're torsido the whole neighborhood is thinking of you
Road dogs for life, you were even there when mine was almost taken
We're living our lives to the edges
But come on and take a fool, can't let this
Go on, roll on, lemme tell you how it all goes down ese
When your living that crazy life a knife you know its gotta be a quette
Cuz nowadays you can't be caught slipping, I'm flipping
I'm ripping it up cuz now I'm trigger tripping
And I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if your bleeding
I'm gonna leave you to lay
Rest in pain, insane in the brain, esto no esta bueno
Just pass me my leño, keeping it hot just like a jalapeño
And what I say applies to everthing
If you should lose me, you'd lose a good thing
If you should lose me, you'd lose a good thing

If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing
If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
