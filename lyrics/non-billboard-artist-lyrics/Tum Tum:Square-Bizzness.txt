Square-Bizzness:Tum Tum
Yeah, y'all know who it is huh
Tum Zilla ya dig, you know I got that blue monster
On them blue D's mayn, square bidness huh
That grey on grey slab huh, square bidness
Everytime I step in, got them boys hating
Keep them broads looking, square business
Ride with the bang loud, cruise with the top down
With a pretty round brown, square business
Z-I double L to the A
Lone Star hustler, 3rd Coast all day
Fresh cruising, thinking due while I be
Big baller belly, you can tell I get the cheese
Haters hating, boppers still bopping
I'm doing my thang homie, hell naw I ain't stopping
Hit after hit, chick after chick
Show after show, whip after whip
Ask your ma, I hit the mall I don't play
I damn near bought, red bird in one day
Lil' Boosie talk, country down and cause hell
Sliding through Dallas, way before the guards rail
Grind time official, very rarely do I sleep
Like the Purple Hulk, I'm on my million dollar creep
Money on my mind, cheddar on my noggin
I know that they plotting, no problem
Flip the candy blue, coke white rag
Blunt in my mouth, pick in my shag
Dipping on Daytons, square bis' no faking
Boom-boom-boom, got the whole block shaking
I like my girls thick, like my money in hunds'
Like my guns with drums, nigga who want some
Damn can I live, stack a couple mills
Zilla on now, on the beat Play-N-Skillz
Show stopper, step in and turn heads
Pull the first bop I see, cornbread fed
Straight crazy, my hoes square wilding
Crazy keep yapping, my scrill keep piling
G-4, take it to the flo'
They said I was done, but I'm back with some mo'
Square business, off that
How can I lose, the whole D got my back
To tell the Costra Nostra, already yes sir
Can't speak up, they whispering cause they scurred
Aw shit, all blue wrist
And your baby mama at the top, I'm bout to do this
