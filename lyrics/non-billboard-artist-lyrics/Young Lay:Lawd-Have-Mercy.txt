Lawd-Have-Mercy:Young Lay
*

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
I didn't want to spill him, I only want his loot
I didn't want to spill him but I had to shoot

[Young Lay]
Lawd have mercy on him, I didn't want to spill him
I only wanted his loot but I had to shoot
As soon as he stopped I turned and locked the door
he reached for his gat
And get the pourin like bleach when I split splat
And on this jack I'm dialin on the cellular
Cudee's in the lowest cuz hit 'em with one and now they was
They tried to milk me so I pealed him quick as fuck
Cudee seen his brains and remains say you sick as the fuck
You know what's up, and yea y'all know the deal
There go them niggas who tried to fandangle let's untangle this
Sicc Set, loccest out, Black 'N' Dangerous
They never knew about my crew and how we came to this
Slapping niggas over the head with a gang of shit
Get respect, got a tech hollerin it's the set
I'm constantly sweatin, rollers might be comin fast
Cudees, some money, a fifth of Remi with some bloody zags
Left him fast cause it was sheisty
Counted the cash and dropped the bitches by the spot
G paper ain't nuthin to have me sneakin up on your daily block
and high as a kite
I cut your neck and nigga that's your life

[Chorus x4]
I didn't want to spill him, I only want his loot
I didn't want to spill him but I had to shoot
(In background:)
Lawd have Mercy, Oh Lawd
Lawd have Mercy, Oh Lawd Heeeyyyeah
Lawd have mercy
Lawd have mercy
Lawd have mercy

[Young Lay]
Killin remains dealin phat livin off of caine
Even got you gat whole crew stacks and pack a mack
How cold are keys and just what have we
Young job schemin, and now we sewin up this whole street
Lounge with me and get y'all spot Sicc Set mack
Till you on the strip with gat and don't want to get jack
It's in his arms I'm not calm
The rollers on our dick and punk bitches know we got it going on
It's in my blood I got love I told my homie run
Because the rollers might be comin bounce
And even though they saw you bounce
And even though your going down toss your g that quarter-ounce
Ruffed and cuffed him and now they fin to rush me
Shit, Lawd have mercy

[Chorus x4]
I didn't want to spill him, I only want his loot
I didn't want to spill him but I had to shoot
(In background:)
Lawd have Mercy, Oh Lawd
Lawd have Mercy, Oh Lawd Heeeyyyeah
Lawd have mercy
Lawd have mercy
Lawd have mercy

[Young Lay]
Shoot'em till he dies take his loot and ride
Who will be doing this shit in the mind of a lunatic
I came across a lot of homies who was nice guys
But some of these nicer guys is jackin in disguise
And hell of mellon G's fuck this sprouts jealousies
And over debatin they got you hatin from the start
Just like that broken heart that homie leaded to another fantasy
Like showing them cops where we lounge at and where we be
Now when they see me they post up explode the turf G
Lawd have mercy

[Chorus until end with mixed vocals]
