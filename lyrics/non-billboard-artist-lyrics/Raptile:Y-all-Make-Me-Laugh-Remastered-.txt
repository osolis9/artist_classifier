Y-all-Make-Me-Laugh-Remastered-:Raptile
Yeah, mr. devine, ruff riders, raptile, monstablokaz!
From NYC to germany! Lets go!


Yall make me laugh (laugh)
Seems yall soft like baby ass (ass)
Everybody hoppin on satans back
Tryin to make the cash
(ohh no, no, no)


Look, im watchin u, big brother style
Ears to the street, spittin, buck em down
If u don't work, u wont eat
And if u steal, don't worry, u gon see
G-O-D takes it back, this is part of the rules
But u cant teach people thinking they smarter than u
Hey don't understand my songs and plans
Man, my plan, take em to the promised land
It takes time, patience, persistence
Between me and u, that's the difference
Everybody tries to get the fat cash flow
And everybody turns to a bad asshole
Most of them end up broke as fuck
Fallin off their family trees like coconuts
I got the weight of the world on my shoulders, but
Im always ready baby, now u know whats upâ€¦


Yall make me laugh (laugh)
