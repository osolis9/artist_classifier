The Prisoner (C Burrows, P Coyne)
Sitting in my peter all alone
And the sun don't shine on my skin and bones
I'm left to rot in hell inside a prison cell
I'm doing time for something I ain't done
A policeman he said I pulled a gun
But I wasn't there oh God I swear

And I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Yes I wish that I could be
So free, so free

Slop in slop out and then lights out
This prison life is killing me it's wearing me down
I crave for liberty they're pissing in my tea
Systemised brutality
The screws and the cons have it in for me
I play the waiting game a number for a name

And I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Yes I wish that I could be
So free so free

So free so free
So free so free

I miss my girl and I miss my ma
I dream of walking out through that door
But much to my surprise I'm institutionalised
I'm on the inside and I'm looking out
Stare at the bars and I scream and shout
But no-one hears my plea they've thrown away the key

And I wish that I could be
Oh I wish that I could be
Yes I wish that I could be
So free so free

So free so free
So free so free
So free so free
So free so free
