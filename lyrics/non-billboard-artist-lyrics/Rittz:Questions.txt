You really snort coke like you said you do on your record?
If so then let me know because I got the soft on deck

I don't rap to get the women
I just want a wife, and a normal life one day
I never had shit
Last year I was cooking in the kitchen
One night I made Toni Braxton a piece of catfish
Getting off work sweating, changing my clothes
Go to a show wearing Po'
Frontin' like I had bread
Limping on my last leg
But you got bread now right?
