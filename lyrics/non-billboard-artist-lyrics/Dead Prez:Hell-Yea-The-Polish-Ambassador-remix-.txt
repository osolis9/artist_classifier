hiding in the corridor until we see the dominos car headlights
white boy in the wrong place at the right time

and when i'm working late nights stockin' boxes i'm creepin' their merchandise
and don't put me on dishes i'm dropping them bitches
and taking all day long to mop the kitchen shit
we ain't getting paid commission, minimum wage, modern day slave conditions
got me flippin' burgers with no power
can't even buy one off what i make in an hour
i'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
i take mine off the top like a politician
where i'm from doing dirt is a part of living
i got mouths to feed i gots to get it
Hell yeah (you down to roll my nigga?)
