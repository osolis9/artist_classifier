The-Bits:Meridian Dan
Roll and sleep in the bits
Talk is cheap in the bits
You can't speak in the bits
I spent all last week in the bits
Gonna grow old in the bits
Can't question my soul in the bits
Couple man sold their soul in the bits
I do this ting for the whole of the bits
All you lot think you know about Danny
Look at the scoreboard, check my tally
How can a man be bammy?
Serious don, always got swammy
Don't talk 'bout gloves and bally
None of you man ain't beating a strally
Serious tools man carry
Can't buy these from cash and carry
All that hype talk, I don't penny
If you see a badman on telly
Rudeboy, don't watch that
IMan, I am the creme de la cremmy
I don't give a damn who's ripped or henny
I'll make a big man shake like jelly
Ask Spray, man bang like Fekky
I've been a G from day, ask Skeppy
Roll and sleep in the bits
Talk is cheap in the bits
You can't speak in the bits
I spent all last week in the bits
Gonna grow old in the bits
Can't question my soul in the bits
Couple man sold their soul in the bits
I do this ting for the whole of the bits
Wake up, sleep and roll on the block
Man can't roll on the block
Why do you think there's holes in my sock?
Man went mad one time with the Glock
It's my time, let me show you the clock
I'm hungry, I can't eat from a shop
Everyone's chicken, I am a cock
Think you're a rudeboy? No, you are not
Wake up, roll and sleep on the ends
Man can't sleep on the ends
Man can't ring my phone for a 10s
I don't care if we're best friends
I don't wanna hear any MCs' sends
I've had enough of Her Majesty's pens
I don't have much jewels or gems
Matt black R6, blacked out Benz
Roll and sleep in the bits
Talk is cheap in the bits
You can't speak in the bits
I spent all last week in the bits
Gonna grow old in the bits
Can't question my soul in the bits
Couple man sold their soul in the bits
I do this ting for the whole of the bits
You will never catch me loose balling
Action Dan don't do much talking
Don't call my bluff cause I'm all-in
Told them I've been a G from morning
I've been a G all evening
Action Dan don't do much speaking
Make a bit of money, man, say that I'm eating
No wasteman can come to the meeting
I get cake like Kipling
I'm a big part of T like Chick King
Yo mate, are you listening?
I've seen a lot of rudeboys turn victim
Why are you watching me bruv?
Got enough people watching above
Man can't tell me watch in a pub
Think that I'm gonna clash man on a dub
Roll and sleep in the bits
Talk is cheap in the bits
You can't speak in the bits
I spent all last week in the bits
Gonna grow old in the bits
Can't question my soul in the bits
Couple man sold their soul in the bits
I do this ting for the whole of the bits
