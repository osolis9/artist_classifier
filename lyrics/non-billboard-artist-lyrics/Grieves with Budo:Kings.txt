Kings:Grieves with Budo
I drink the colouded city rain water
you can never save my soul
Painted glass on my stomach
and i don 't break it for no one; go!
The blood runs like a river
when your backs turned
and hope don 't float
when it 's chockin on it 's last words

word, which one would you used to describe this?
i'm sick of fighting
everybody around me for silence
sick of tryin to get by inside
of your slilly blinded vision
of what you thought life was before you dived in

take a look at me
i 'm picking through my last meal
heading to the galos with a smile
on my cracked grill

and that 's real;
you can keep your little rap deals
cause i don 't give a damn
about being king of they crap hill
stop and let it fall where the chips land
and take the earth from underneath
your fragile pride and kickstand
so when it all clears and the rain clouds fade
you can sleep with the rest
of the skeletons in they grave

This city; it 's really got a hold on you
This city; it 's really got a hold on you

you don 't need to fight me off
i 'm well on my way
gunna leave these cobblestones
and matchsticks in the back of my brain
i learned that you don 't have
a single word left that you can say
gunna make me quiver when you
wave it like a knife in my face

you can cherish these bricks all day
but not a single one will get you
outta here and take you away
you want a throne that can never be claimed
but standing there looking like
another drone that lost his way
so take the broken crown off,
bowin in a kingdom full of fools gold
searching for a diamond
in a pile full of bruised hopes

you 're looking at me through
those tiny little two holes
that lie to you and force you
to be blinded when the truth shows
yeah i guess i 'm nothing but a blood drop
that fell out your blacklisted
number one spot
coagulate me i 'm ready to be released
and outta your palms like
a burgandy padded breeze

how poetic you all want change
but won 't let it
get a breath of any answer
till you decided that it 's ready to breathe
believe me that 's the nature of the beast
break it 's little legs and watch it try to flee
watch it hobble out your awful line of reach
turn around and pull the cotton out
it 's mouth and pour it 's heart into the streets
and when all of this is over
you can sharpen up your teeth
just to smile in the mirror
while the rest of you depletes

This city; it 's really got a hold on you
This city; yeah it 's really ate a hole through you

you don 't need to fight me off
i 'm well on my way
gunna leave these cobblestones
and matchsticks in the back of my brain
i learned that you don 't have
a single word left that you can say
gunna make me quiver
when you wave it like a knife in my face

your king is dead

you don 't need to fight me off
i 'm well on my way
gunna leave these cobblestones
and matchsticks in the back of my brain
i learned that you don 't have
a single word left that you can say
gunna make me quiver
when you wave it like a knife in my face

your king is dead
