Get that
Don't get me wrong now
Won't keep your secrets
Though it's misleading
Let's get to drinking
And act like it's your birthday
Why you wearing all them clothes
(ok ok)
Don't get me wrong now
Won't keep your secrets
Though it's misleading
Let's get to drinking
And act like it's your birthday
Why you wearing all them clothes

Don't get me wrong now
Won't keep your secrets
Though it's misleading
But I'm only being fair
I know I stop and stare
Cuz girl you're wearing so damn fine
Don't get me wrong now
Won't keep your secrets
Though it's misleading

But I'm only being fair

I know I stop and stare

Baby girl get it right
Girl don't start assuming
Cuz once you hopping with me definitely
Girl your life gonna be booming
Everything you ever wanted
You can get it from a gangsta
San Diego
Clacker from ya
Boss is doing
Extra player
Candy Harley slumping like a Chevy on like one that's janking

Hope you ready
To get fraidy

You don't want it
I won't make you

Get ready to chase her
Her body her look her placement
I'm ready baby
So taste it
Just take it and never waste it
I'm dirty I'm clean you're basic
I'm basically all the places you've never been
And you love it
We hugging it up in my space
That space bar in your playlist
I'm bass bar in your cadence
And race car in the rest
Is you chase
Follow
Get lapped
So hear me go
Gotta a way that I talk that'll make her glow
Watching you move

Gotta move
What's next
Should I let you know

Your place in mind baby
I'm thinking mine baby
I gotta hold you in
Content from looking nines baby

Maybe we'll dine lady
I got a nine eighty
Credit score can't afford

To commit a crime baby

That silicone looking right
Kicking runs this too
Get you off this molotov cocktail

No telling what you might do

Introduce you and your crew
To all my dudes
No iPhones in the room
And we'll do this got by lune

Don't get me wrong now
Won't keep your secrets
Though it's misleading
But I'm only being fair
I know I stop and stare
Cuz girl you're wearing so damn fine
Don't get me wrong now

Won't keep your secrets
Though it's misleading
But I'm only being fair
I know I stop and stare
I stop and stare
Feel me know

Where to go
Gotta bed
For the low
Wanna head for the high
Kill that flow
Wanna know
That you ain't no saint
But you still get by

Your place in mind baby
I'm thinking mine baby
I gotta hold you in
Content from looking nines baby
Maybe we'll dine lady
I got a nine eighty
Credit score can't afford
To commit a crime baby

Don't get me wrong now
Won't keep your secrets
Though it's misleading
Let's get to drinking
And act like it's your birthday
Why you wearing all them clothes
(ok)
