Nothing-But-Us:Curren$y
[** Curren$y feat. Smoke DZA:]


[Curren$y:]
We don't allow blunts in the cut*
Tell the valet to pull up my truck
Higher than a muh, ain't nothing what up but us
Ain't nothing what up but us
We don't allow blunts in the cut.Yeah

[Verse:]
Peel off like a new era sticker.
Out that bitch like a newborn my nigga.
Vant get tangled in the web of broad weave, over your bed sleep.
Homie ya weak, that's not g.
Holding hands with ya bitch, when the money come you cant reach.
Do when its money talk you cant speak.
Who you been with jive ass?
I'm Hollywood multitasking, rappin' and acting.
You just acting like u rapping.
Acting like you trappin', you trap champ, what happened?
I'm high in a psycodelic tree smiling.
Cheshire Cat'n,  galapagos island. turtle shell hashing.
Spillin, smoken' good with a bad one
Jets nigga playing dirty with the fair ones.
The Brazilian thick leg wavy hair ones.
Been on cloud 9 since square one. Yeah

[Hook: ~Curren$y~]
Higher than a muh, Ain't nothing what up but us
Paper Planes mang, We don't allow blunts in the cut
Tell the valet to pull up my truck
Higher than a muh, Ain't nothing what up but us
Ain't nothing what up but us
Ain't nothing what up but us
We don't allow blunts in the cut

[Smoke DZA:]
Anytime you see me I'm lo'd up.
Roll up, light something, then i smoke up
I be steamin', I don't pass really.
Nigga be higher than giraffe pussy 
That ain't Dour that's a GAF Rookie
This is Cali not Canadian
These type of buds change whatever mind frame u in.
I be so thrown off.
Whats in them papers got me popped
You think I'm sleeping but I'm not
Was gunna say something, But I forgot.
I roll up for breakfast
I be on my jets shit
Me and spitta smoke and zone it don't be nothing left its
George kush I'm on that bomb shit.
Hoping the bag shit smell like armpits
Doesn't matter whose blunts be the longest
What I smoke be potent, hope ya lungs is the strongest
My pot heads what up, what up
Spark up Nigga, ain't nothing up but us
DZA

[Hook: ~Curren$y~]
Higher than a muh, ain't nothing what up but us
Paper Planes mang, We don't allow blunts in the cut
Tell the valet to pull up my truck
Higher than a muh, ain't nothing what up but us
Ain't nothing what up but us
Ain't nothing what up but us
We don't allow blunts in the cut
