I-m-Insane:D-Tension
My phone is off the hook,
You're cramping up my style.
I can't believe you feel neglected,
You are such a child.
I'm going off the edge,
I think you're too obsessed.
You're so attached.
I'm about to cut the cord,
It needs a rest.

Won't leave me alone,
Get a busy tone,
Stuck inside my home,
I'm going crazy.
Need a little space,
I'm sick of your face,
Now a mental place,
What have you done to me?

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
It's disturbing I forgot to mention.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
Think I'm craving some other attention.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
Yes I'm for you but you never listen.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
End up single but I know what I'm missing.

You're suffocating me,
I need some room to stop.
I'm locked up in a cage,
And you're the one that has the key.

I make just no mistake,
I think I want to break,
And if we jump then it's my sanity that you will take.

Won't leave me alone,
Get a busy tone,
Stuck inside my home,
I'm going crazy.
Need a little space,
I'm sick of your face,
Now a mental place,
What have you done to me?

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
It's disturbing I forgot to mention.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
Think I'm craving some other attention.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
Yes I'm for you but you never listen.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
End up single but I know what I'm missing.

Let's bring it back to reality,
It's time to respect my boundaries.
You're pressuring to get close to me,
I think I'm ready for some space.

Give me back my space.
Give me back my space.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
It's disturbing I forgot to mention.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
Think I'm craving some other attention.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
Yes I'm for you but you never listen.

I'm insane,
You make me insane.
I'm insane,
End up single but I know what I'm missing.

It's disturbing I forgot to mention,
Think I'm craving some other attention.
