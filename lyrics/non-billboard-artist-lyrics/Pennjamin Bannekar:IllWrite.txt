thats why I kill mics, niggas know my skills nice
bitches know im ill twice, thats why they let me fuck wit em when i feel like
man i live a ill life, of course a nigga feel strife
i got enough a balls im just waitin on a pitched strike...
take it out the park like im hank aaron
u know i hate sharing so this is featureless
it only features me on the feature list
now the features on forget the previous
(u should) be honored u can preview this

im tired of all the illuminati talk
im lookin from them illuminati boys so they can illuminate my career
people induldge ignorance
where the smart ppl go i only see idiots
why it gotta be some underlying reason
if u r a success u gotta undermine Jesus
this is straight from my chest i would undeny satan
if i thought for a minute it would multiply my paper
most deny they favor thats y they aint paid up
instead of lookin in the mirror to see how they made up
they come wit explanations implicating satan
thats gotta be the reason these bigger figures made it
maybe they just worked hard alter what u thinkin
maybe they deserve they offers that they bring in
if somebody else shout illuminati
i hope u meet death power out ya body

and when it become cool to be just average
mediocre here we go sir i dont wanna be the best
i'll get over being noticed hope u all see me less
hope i get C's on test hope i get 3 of 5
nope i change that statement cuz 3's just a lil high
2's more in line with what i been taught in life
u cant be serious mafucka
i cant believe im hearing this it make me shudder
i cant be near this kind of weak mind assumption
i reach for the summit everytime i do somethin
ima breach from amongst u and preach to the young youth
and tell em being average will cease what they wanna do
peace to the mean i dont wanna be the median
i'm tryna be large i dont wanna be a medium
so if u seeing Penn know im atypical
cuz been average means u are typical
