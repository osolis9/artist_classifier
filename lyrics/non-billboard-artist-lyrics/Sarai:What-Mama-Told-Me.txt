What-Mama-Told-Me:Sarai
Woo, uh-huh, uh-huhh
Uh-huhh, oh yeah
Ha ha hahh

Forget what mama told me as a little girl
'Bout to get grown, get on and rock yo' world
Your body tellin' my body how your song goes
While you smackin' my bum-bum like your bongos

Ride it like Tonto, I'll be your sidekick
The sweetest sang when the mouth silent
When you doin' what you doin'
Get to movin' the tongue, tornado
"Oh I ain't in Kansas no more"

I ain't no hoe, no whore, I deserve a reward
Waterbed make waves like the seashore
I see more in you than the average Joe
So you don't see the trash where the average go

It ain't standard to have a dude in my clutch
Sometimes I buck, hold on, the ride gets rough
I feel I must touch the A
Double barrel gun baby, we both bust

You make me feel like dancin'
When you get to romancin' me
Make me wanna sing so sweet
Body to body I feel ya heat

Ya make me wanna freak out
Ain't no way I'm goin' home, lonely
Make me feel like sweatin' forgettin'
Everything my mama told me

You and the liquor got my eyes blurrin'
And when you licka the kitten for certain, she get to purrin'
Ridin' the wave you got me surfin', eatin' what I'm servin'
I'll play the game, show me what's behind the curtain

All the slurrin' got me urgin' to get the work in
Bodies mergin', hot like chicken jerkin'
X-Rated version, me and this person
Gettin' down in the dirt and grabbin' his shirt and his jeans

Perkin', have him hittin' high notes like MC, in 'Fantasy'
Could it be you and me on the 'Island' whylin'?
You down low like you deep-sea divin'

Worlds collidin', emotions explodin'
Juices flowin', the climax approachin'
Face soakin' that no. 9 potion
You need some winnin' plays, get me to coachin'

You make me feel like dancin'
When you get to romancin' me
Make me wanna sing so sweet
Body to body I feel ya heat

Ya make me wanna freak out
Ain't no way I'm goin' home, lonely
Make me feel like sweatin' forgettin'
Everything my mama told me

I think I might, try to get this fly guy
In my, ride, hop in the 7-4-5-i-i
Take you places you ain't never seen
Can you keep your cool if I whip until you cream?

Don't mean to be obscene, put the children to bed
Thugs like N.O.R.E. in the whip gettin' 'Hed'
What I said like Keyshaun, I'm the receiver
Gwan' try me, testify, you a believer
You never up and leave her

Stay on call, Dr. Dutch, master of it all
Move slow like the Southern drawl
And make it quick like the N.Y.C.
Cats spit, oh shit

You make me feel like dancin'
When you get to romancin' me
Make me wanna sing so sweet
Body to body I feel ya heat

Ya make me wanna freak out
Ain't no way I'm goin' home, lonely
Make me feel like sweatin' forgettin'
Everything my mama told me

You make me feel like dancin'
When you get to romancin' me
Make me wanna sing so sweet
Body to body I feel ya heat

Ya make me wanna freak out
Ain't no way I'm goin' home, lonely
Make me feel like sweatin' forgettin'
Everything my mama told me
