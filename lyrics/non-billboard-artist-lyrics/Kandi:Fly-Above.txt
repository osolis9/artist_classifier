Fly-Above:Kandi
VERSE 1

im so comfortable in the skin im in
im secure about who i am
so u can talk all u wanna, i build up a shell
and its hard as armor
it seems like every step i take up
drama comes along with the bread i cake up
but u anit doin nothin if u dont have no haters
so welcome u to do whats in your nature

im like a jet air plane
way to high to hear u throwin salt on my name
i know im not the only one that people love to hate
u go and throw ur hands up go head spread yo wings cuz u gotta fly above

CHROUS

i fly above all the drama
i i fly above i i fly above i i fly above its beneath me
its beneath me its beneath me
so i fly above all the haters
i i fly above i i fly above i i fly above
its beneath me its beaneath me its beneath me

VERSE 2

if everybody hatin cuz u fly-i-i
then gon throw yo hands in the sky-i-i
if people jealous cuz u live yo live-i-i
then gon throw yo hands in the sky-i-i
see i anit even worried bout you and your insecurities
the only thing that matters is my family and G.O.D
ima shooting star but my feet still on the ground
and when you flyin high they wanna shoot u down

im like a jet air plane way to high to hear throwin salt on my name
i know im not the only one that people love too hate
u go and throw yo hands up go head spread yo wings cuz u gotta fly above

CHROUS
