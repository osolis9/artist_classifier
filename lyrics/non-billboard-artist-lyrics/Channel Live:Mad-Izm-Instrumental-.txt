Mad-Izm-Instrumental-:Channel Live
Uhh! Yeahhh
I know you're diggin this type of shit right here
We about to spark it on the mic yeahhh
Come on!

The episode starts when I walk down the block kid
Reach in my poc ket yo where's my knot it
Follows me into the spot come tellin
Go check the dread and yes he's herb selling
A punani gate I'm a potential felon
Izm is smelling, like I ain't even telling
Channel one two, I'm smashing the law
Channel three, I make a run to the store
Channel four leave the store with the Phillie blunts I...
Spark the izm, I'm off to Channel Live

Wake up in the morning got the yearning for herb
which loosens up the nouns, metaphors, and verbs
And adjectives, ain't it magic kid what I'm kicking
Multi-flavored bags of sess, for the picking
So listen to the izm as it talks nonstop
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin but so is the chocolate thai
Now the high, starts to settle
Kickin fat lyrics that rocks, like heavy metal

I'm comin out de dance wif de spliff of sensei
When I speak, big up Mack, L.O., and Malik
Like John Lennon, yes I'm I-C-M'n
I start grinnin, and syllables start bendin
My style is untangible, like a wild animal
Check the label as it goes around it's called Capitol
That's what I'm smacking you with cuz it's easy
Like Lionel Richie, your whole style is bitchy
Switch me, mix me, somebody get me
Don't let me rip out my clothes like Bill Bixby
Gripping the microphone until I'm motherfucking sixty
Smoking the indo, by the window, it's sticky

Spark the izm, my expertism, is lyricism
My flow will take you over, like I was hypnotism
So where's the lighter, to decipher, the skills that I'm bringing
Hyper than a little kid on ginseng roots
And culture, my intellect will insult ya
Finish off your dead mind like a vulture
I gotta get mine, get a grip
Cuz there's all these weak rappers steady making hits, FUCK THAT!
But ninety-four I bring the skills back
So listen now I'm doing what I want to do and sparking mad izm

All we do is spark mad izm

I come with notions, deeper than the ocean
Check out my potion, mad rhythm in the motion
The izm, brings the wisdom, when I kick it on the rhythm
Check it how I rock it in a cipher
Desire, takes you higher, lyrical messiah
(yo yo yo yo yo pass the lighter)
Counterclockwise I rise like the sun
Now feel the heat from the rays of the gun
Shooting out the mental mist
How you gonna know the real shit when your style's counterfeit?

His shit is counterfeit cuz he's motherfucking phony
Come into the jam try to front like he know me
Hah! Listen to this new type of somethin
Bumpin, ninety-four ain't for no frontin
New type of lingo, catchy like a jingle
Rougneck hip-hop is drippin from the single
Now, let meduce you to the one
The Channel Live indo this loosens you up
Going to the channels of the remote control
Flicking through the frequencies of your soul

Then roll the izm, the inflater, I'm weeded
Like wearing a sweater, at the equator, I'm heated
But I flip a style like I flip a channel
Step up and test the skills, you can get my tes-ticules
Cuz hip-hop's been running through my veins ever since
So it wasn't hard for me to grab the mic and represent
Representing tormenting MC's craniums
Till they can't flow why cuz I'm draining em
Don't mean to be blunt but don't front
I'm doing it for the love so now I'm doing what I want
To do with my Channel Live crew so just listen
Dissing wack MC's and sparking up mad izm

All we do is spark mad izm ...
