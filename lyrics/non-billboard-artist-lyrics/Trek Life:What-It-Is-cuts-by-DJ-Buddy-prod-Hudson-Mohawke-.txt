mmh! mhhh! mmmmmhmmmhm! mmh!

Nina is walkin down the street,
don't know what piled up inside she be keeping, her life just so descrete,
gucci heels upon her feet,
look in her eyes so much pain in her soul,
everibro chop inside, nicknamed super bowl,
3 piont chic yh recieving all the goals,
different colours on her face looking like a rainbow,
comes home everyday to break down and cry,
cus all she living is a lie,
hair
make up
shoes
nails
girl you lookin all fake,
For god sake,
you think that short louis dress gonna make you a hot cake?
stop kidding your self,
whip of the shid .and look in the mirrow
what do you see?
true beauty,
nina pls stop and think,
unlike akon girl you dont take the blame,
chasing rich guys like you are fuckin insane,
just to hop from plane to plane
Or just to get that pink range, Nah
You dont have to open you leg that wide
Just to get small kudi for your back side
Dont make your self that cheap
cus you worth more than that jeep .

life is not wat you wear
live your life like just you dont care
people gonna say stuff
its your life so take the front seat
what they think is not necessary
putting make up on
just to make up for what you think you dont have
what you think you dont have
and thats wrong

Kwame is walking down the street,
Bushy hair, bearfooted, running around exclusive nudity,
Terrorize community,
finished high school as a young bright boy,
Drop out neighbor just bought a benz toy,
All black, alloy rim 22 inches,
Getting all the hood bitches,
With his riches
Kwame started to envy
Like an hp
Was told to go see malam issah by that lake bi
So that one dat meab he will buy the mayB,
He has always wanted,
Taking front seat in his fast life,
used his little sister a a sacrifice
After 1 year he realized it was all lies
Wen he could hear ama's cries,
In the walls of his mansion
Not true satisfaction
Did it for attention
Definitely a wrong course of action
Now he is on the streets galavating
Kwame lost everything
Family
Friends
Money
The honeys
So relax one day it go be sunny
Before your back crack on the fast track bring that back

life is not wat you wear
live your life like just you dont care
people gonna say stuff
its your life so take the front seat
what they think is not necessary
putting make up on
just to make up for what you think you dont have
what you think you dont have
and thats wrong

So Dont loose yourself
If you lost just scream for help
Cus there is always someone there to catch you
Society tryna drown you
And if you're beaten black and blue
There are a lot of things you can do
The choice is your hand
And I hope you understand
So live life
its your life
