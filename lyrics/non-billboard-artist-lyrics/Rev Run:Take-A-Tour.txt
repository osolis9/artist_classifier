Take-A-Tour:Rev Run
Backlight, umm
Gotta be 79, 80, maybe even 81
But I thought it was 80, that's it
Flash and Melle Mel

Aiyyo tips and toes and fly poses
I resurrect and respect like I'm Moses
Flows is boasts, 'Def' just like 'Mos' is
And caked out like Rev just bought Hostess

Run got a rhyme designed like seven-nine was
I come to flip the script and change time 'cause
Go, here we go, here we, here we, here we made it
I take it back 'fore flattops was faded
Way before the laptop created
But now it's on and back and y'all played it

And you don't stop, it's the sure shot
Francois see'est faux, Flashe' no deux
And you don't stop, it's the sure shot
Take a tour, take a tour

And you don't stop, it's the sure shot
Francois see'est faux, Flashe' no deux
I said don't stop, do punk rock

Played a game that couldn't last
An ounce of memories from the past
The life I thought, I wanted is today

Aiyyo back by choices and my voice is
On point just like a Rolls Royce is
Noises, boys is poison with toys
Caked out and Run be the moistest

Run got a rhyme designed like seven-nine was
I come to flip the script and change time 'cause
Go, here we go, here we, here we, here we nitro
That nigga Run insure you like Geico
I 'member Flash and Mel rocked the night, yo
And back then them boys was like nitro

And you don't stop, it's the sure shot
Francois see'est faux, Flashe' no deux
And you don't stop, it's the sure shot
Take a tour, take a tour

And you don't stop, it's the sure shot
Francois see'est faux, Flashe' no deux
I said don't stop, do punk rock
