Take-My-Money:311
I'm jumping off a cliff into the Milky Way
Caution to the wind with what I'm gonna say
I dip into a song, a song I speak in front of you
A song long to see it's overdue

So jump right in just where it is you fit in
I just want to get in, to disc off a ride
We're on a comet and nothing can stop it
Hang on don't drop it, I got to let it glide

Come on baby, take my money
Let me help you make it past
Those days that are not quite yet sunny
But one day will be at last
Yeah, take that

I want to boss some time with real meaning
And then spend our twilight's last gleamings
Just probing the fields of relativity
A grand wandering between you and me

I want to boss some time with real meaning
And then spend our twilight's last gleamings
Just probing the fields of relativity
A grand wandering between you and me

Uncle Sam, he'll put out his hand
You got to understand, he's gonna take some away
He's got another plan, he's a tax man
Won't say thanks ma'am
Even if you finally make him say good goddamn

That's what I said when I first saw you, mmm hmm
That's what I say when I don't know what to do
Tell me, how could I adjust the fondness of you
Tell me all the little things

Come on baby, take my money
Let me help you make it past
Those days that are not quite yet sunny
But one day will be at last
Yeah, take that

I want to boss some time with real meaning
And then spend our twilight's last gleamings
Just probing the fields of relativity
A grand wandering between you and me

Do you get it, girl?
Grab the money run
And take it off the top
Now go have fun
Don't worry about me
I'll make another sum
You got a live one

Come on baby, take my money
Let me help you make it past
Those days that are not quite yet sunny
But one day will be at last
Yeah, take that
