Private-Symphony-Remix-:Maestro Fresh Wes
Yeah

Baby, won't you let me hold you in my arms forever more?
I conduct your fantasy in a private symphony

Picture you and I way up in the sky
Flying over oceans while the clouds go passing by
I kiss you on your lips and taste your scented neck
We're going on a trip, we'll never ever forget

I'll take you on a voyage
(Voyage)
Traveling hand in hand
Yeah, I'm like an orchestra
Your body I command

Conducting, instructing, you won't need to move
I'll tell you straight up, girl, won't nobody disturb this groove
You've been more than just my lover
You've been my lady, a special friend to me
So take my hand and lets engage in a private symphony

Darling, let me dedicate this
Moment to my love affair
Look into my eyes, well, can't you see?
You and me in a private symphony

We'll make love all night and all through the morning
I'll still hold you tight
(Tight)
While the beautiful sunset's forming

See, we don't need no band, baby
Or no rhythm section
(Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm)
'Cause in this symphony, harmony is made from affection

We'll be rolling, squeezing, pleasing each other, girl
(Yeah, baby, yeah)
All over and over and over again, I could never ever love another
While the harmony plays, our love will never fade
Because from this day 'til eternity sweet music will be made

'Cause you've been more than just my lover
You've been my lady, a special friend to me
So take my hand and lets engage in a private symphony

Baby, won't you let me hold you?
I want to hold you, baby, in my arms forever more
I want to hold you in my arms

I conduct your fantasy
I'll conduct all your fantasies, baby, you and me
In a private symphony, in a private symphony

Darling, let me dedicate this
Moment to my love affair
Look into my eyes, well, can't you see?
You and me in a private symphony

I want to dedicate this to you, baby
Look at me, look into my eyes
Can't you see? You and me
In a private symphony, yeah
Private symphony, you and me

It spins for you and me
Hold me, I want you by my side, honey
Private symphony
Never let me go
