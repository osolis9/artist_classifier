I gave chase you fled away
You laughed in my face when I beg you stay, yeah
I crawl down to bended knee
You dogged me out treat me like an enemy yeah
And despite the tears in the way you act
If you just come home I take you back
With a love like this there is no pride
I feel for you this wide
I hung my head and died

The house is decieving, I clean the lair within
Man ya'll using arrogance like it's heroin (why?)

Your flesh is weary come rest in me like the Sheraton (c'mon)

We must have conformity to him in grace, before we can have communion with him in glory; grace and glory are linked and chained together; grace precedes glory, as the morning-star ushers in the sun. only "The pure in heart shall see God;"
