Suspension-demo-:Ma$e
Lately I'm alright,
And lately I'm not scared
I figured out that what you do to me feels like
I'm floating on air.
I don't need to know right now,
All I know is I believe
In the very thing that got us here
And now I can't leave.

Say anything, but say what you mean
'Cause I'm caught in suspension.

Now I'm wanting this for sure
And I'll beg for nothing more.
I plan all day and drive all night;
I love what's in store.
I can't seem to stop this now,
Even if it's not so clear,
And I'll take what I can get
If you want me here.

Say anything, but say what you mean
When you whisper, "You want this,"
Your eyes tell the same.
We are gaining speed,
I can barely breathe
'Cause I'm caught in suspension.

It's enough for me to get excited,
It's enough for me to feel ...Woah!

Say anything, but say what you mean
When you whisper, "You want this,"
Your eyes tell the same.
We are gaining speed, (suspension)
I can barely breathe (oh please say what you mean)
'Cause I'm caught in suspension, (caught in suspension),
I'm caught in suspension.

Say (say) anything (suspension),
But say what you mean. (oh please say what you mean)
I'm caught in suspension. (caught in suspension)
I'm caught in suspension.
We are gaining speed, (suspension)
I can barely breathe. (oh I can barely breathe)
I'm caught in suspension. (caught in suspension)
I'm caught in suspension.

Say (say) anything, (suspension)
But say what you mean. (oh I can barely breathe)
I'm caught in suspension.
