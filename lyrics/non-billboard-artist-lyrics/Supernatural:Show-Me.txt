Show-Me:Supernatural
Your not a victim of the world inside (yeah yeah yeah)
There's such a better way to live your life (yeah yeah yeah)
You know I'm never gonna waste your time (yeah yeah yeah)
I know you're thinking that I'm not quite right
But I'm so happy when I close my eyes
There's a rainbow in the sky
And it's there for you and I
Where we can be together

CHORUS

Come on and show me what you got is all right
We're keeping the groove and we're dancing all night
You know we're gonna be calling you
You can do what you want to do
And you can be dancing in the feeling all night
You'll think it's a dream but the feel is allright
Just give in and be on your way
You can be what you want to be

They got you thinking that the sun won't shine (yeah yeah yeah)
Well follow me and we can take that ride (yeah yeah yeah)
I've got a message for the world, if you don't mind (yeah yeah yeah)
I know you're thinking that I'm not quite right
But I'm so happy when I close my eyes
There's a rainbow in the sky
And it's there for you and I
Where we can be together

CHORUS, repeat

Why won't you wanna make a dream come true
Don't ever listen to the things they're telling you
You've got the generation in your hand
Don't live in silence of the other man

CHORUS, repeat
