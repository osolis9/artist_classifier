This-Is-What-It-Looks-Like:PJ
[Verse 1]
I'm so far from the typical
I'm nothing but original
You never saw the difference 'til now
I know the road is difficult
I'm ready for the ridicule
I'm doing shit they could never do, Ow

[Bridge]
Cause when they told me no
I did that shit regardless
Look this is who I am
Nothing to change, I'm sorry
Feet hurt, I been walking for a long time
I get the feeling everything is gonna be alright
[Chorus]
This is what it look like
When you get up and your tired, and you still grind
This is what it looks like
When they didn't give a fuck about you
But you still alive
Yeah, yeah this is what it looks like (x2)

This is what it look like
When you put on what you want, and then you still fly
This is what it look like
When your pretty, just as pretty as the inside and
La la, yeah this is what it look like (x2)

[Verse 2]
When everything's political, I know it's more than critical
And what I say, it somehow get's out
When no one's like you anywhere
They'll never put you anywhere except for a little space they call down

[Bridge]
But when they told me no
I did that shit regardless
Look this is who I am
Nothing to change, I'm sorry, yeahhh
Feet hurtin', I been walking for a long time
I get the feeling everything is gun' be alright

[Chorus]
This is what it look like
When you get up and your tired, and you still grind
This is what it looks like
When they didn't give a fuck about you
But you still alive
Yeahhh, yeah this is what it looks like (x2)

[Outro]
Proud of what I been through
Don't you know the new shoes never felt as good as the old ones
I am gunna go the whole time just for them to realize
Somethin' in my heart, I already knew
Woke up the sky was cloudless
And there ain't no one like me around here
