Separated-Real-from-the-Fake-:Havoc
We all gathered here today to say goodbye to the lies bitch
Hammer hit a nigga face, got him talking high pitch
Fall settle like you belong into ...stilettos
You drinking the womans drink, Im on that hennesey level
You sounding real sentimental, and soft in your hooks
Cant believe how this nigga dress and get nauseous when I look
20 20 vision but had to take another look
Would have thought it was fetching like the motherfucker books
Keep, using them 48 laws wrong get murked
You used to spit bars, now you just church
Like a little bird, and most of your album is for the love birds
Such wild in, I keep it 1000
You trying new blouses,
Prove a nigga wrong, put your money where you mouth is
What happened to the principles, just style... bout shit
This is what you call beef, Im bout to take a cowshit
x 2
Separate the real from the fake,
The fake from the real,
Wipe that little smurk off your grill
Niggas must be sniffing out the bills
I helped your fucking mind
You probably popped too many pills
And when we bring it to you
The fear run through you, and paralyze thoughts
Homie Im too boss, you know walk a sleeping giant
But ...to get dwarf
Just liability, so I gotta write you off
And toss to the side, your hide is too soft
You pussy like clitoris, you addicted to dick riding
And you cant get off it
Turn your children to orphans
Fuck outta here, you my offspring
Gave you that life that you talking
Qb to my motherfucking coffing
Burning the sour till Im coughing
And high as a plane, Im just riding my lane
If its not broke, why fix it
Why the fuck would I change?
Spit the shit that go inside of nigga thang
Pictures all me, and my crib, cause Im the thing
Tired of impostors, take them off the rosters
Then Ill be at your door, with the motherfucking choppers
x 2
Separate the real from the fake,
The fake from the real,
Wipe that little smurk off your grill
Niggas must be sniffing out the bills
I helped your fucking mind
You probably popped too many pills
And when we bring it to you
You wouldnt probably do is squeal.
