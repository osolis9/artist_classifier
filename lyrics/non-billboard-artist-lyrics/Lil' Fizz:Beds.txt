Beds:Lil' Fizz
Baby, what would be the best move?
Do you in my guest room
Shorty let me bless you
Show you what the sex do

Yes, dudes the best dude
Tryna sex you
Heard you got that grade A
Come and let me test you

I lay you down
Let me show what that twin like
Girl you say you sick
Lemme be your medicine like

Plus you say you been tight
You ain't had a fit right
Bet I make you feel nice
You ain't had a hit like

This is surely I don't miss
One kiss will make you drip
Baby, lose your grip

One stroke you'll have you soaked
Baby that's for sure
And you say you wanna know
So what the hell you waitin' for

This is what we do
We was in my bed
California king
Me between your legs

Lay you on my queen
Or my twin instead
Say you wanna know
How far we wanna go

This is what we do
We was in my bed
California king
Me between your legs

Lay you on my queen
Or my twin instead
Say you wanna know
How far we wanna go
Just get in my bed

You wanna know if we roll out
Will I give you that proper
On a Fruition or a roll out, baby

You'll be callin' your doctor
You'll be screamin' a lot of
Nasty things they'll think I been doin'
You callin' me papa

Baby, I'm not ya daddy
I just give you that good
But after some face
I can give you that great

We done that seven fifty nine
And you be feinin' that eight
You tell your friends that you fine
But they know you can't wait

Because you talkin' about me
Like everyday
And you tell them how we do it
In like every way

So you say you wanna roll
But first you gotta know
Just how far we wanna go
What the hell you waitin' for

This is what we do
We was in my bed
California king
Me between your legs

Lay you on my queen
Or my twin instead
Say you wanna know
How far we gonna go

This is what we do
We was in my bed

Me between the legs

Lay you on my queen
Or my twin instead

Just get in my bed

Bed so I can break you off
Take it off, make it hard, make it soft
My patience gone
Now let me rip them labels off

Lay you cross this table cloth
I been havin' crazy thoughts
'Bout bras and panties
Hope they matchin' me wit this blazer off

Come here lemme blaze you off
Yes babe, I'm a major boss
You'll be glad you paid the cost
Now come here get yo major toss

Fizzy boy amaze 'em all
Invade the walls and break 'em all
I laid you down, I laid you out
And now its time to lay you off

This is what we do
We was in my bed
California king
Me between your legs

Lay you on my queen
Or my twin instead
Say you wanna know
How far we gonna go

This is what we do
We was in my bed
California king
Me between your legs

Lay you on my queen
Or my twin instead
Say you wanna know
How far we wanna go
Just get in my bed
