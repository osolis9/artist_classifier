Moving-Forward-Live:Ziggy Marley
The human experiment comes with pain
And through it all you got to live again
From the day that I was born
Yesterday was already gone
It's not easy so I can't pretend
Those who are angels were once my friends
I don't wanna stay with the evil I know
I don't wanna keep my enemies close
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The hurt make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
Sometimes it seems impossible
The obstacles that we must climb
Adversity is my ally
Even though she makes me cry
Moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The hurt make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
