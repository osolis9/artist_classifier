Lost-Generation:Rizzle Kicks
I said I’m living in a lost generation
I’ve got my heart
I’ve found my soul

I’m living
I’m living
I’m living
Life man

Switch on the TV,
They keep it real, but not in that way
I turn the channel
And just see somebody’s life displayed
Awkward causes and dodgy moments
I smile it keeps me sane
Reality TV is morphine
Give me that now
Let me ease the pain
(Oh Yeah)

Man, talent shows
I seen some of our friends go and beat their targets
I’ve also seen carrers end when they ain’t even really started
Jeremy Kyle got the nation laughing at other people’s expense
Sombody tell that guy that we hate him too, we are not his friends

We make people go clap clap yeah
When I heard people buy views
I was more confused than all Jhon Terry’s black friends
Watch your mouth son

Oi big brothers in the house now yeah
I said screw the voting and the talking
I just wanna see people fight and have sex

Chorus:
So let’s say Hey (hey)
I’m living
I’m living
Life man

Say Hey (hey)
I’m living
I’m living
Life man
I’ve got my heart
I’ve found my soul
I’m living
I’m living
I said I’m living in a lost generation
I said I’m living in a lost generation
I’ve got my heart
I’ve found my soul
I’m living
I’m living
I’m living
Life man

Verse:
Yeah, I wanna dance
I wanna have fun
Let me feel the music
I hope you realize how dumb you sound when you call us stupid
I wanna drive to work hear this beat and make my dreams come true
Keep it up man a beat like this reminds my heart what to do
Salute
I want you to feel useless
Baby that’s right, every bad boy should
And damn right I’m a slut, you know this
But I’m a boy, it’s all good
Take sna?s of me, I’m an icon standing here in my shades
Oi be someone
If you beg to be followed then you’ve lost your way

We make people go clap, clap yeah
Why is everybody so PC
It’s not my fault if you take offense
Watch your mouth son

What’s wrong if a girl loves sex?
It’s only wrong if it’s not with you
So maybe you should get better in bed
(you naughty boy)

Chorus:
Say Hey (hey)
I’m living
I’m living
Life man

Say Hey (hey)
I’m living
I’m living
Life man
I’ve got my heart
I’ve found my soul
I’m living
I’m living
I said I’m living in a lost generation
I said I’m living in a lost generation
I’ve got my heart
I’ve found my soul
I’m living
I’m living
I’m living
Life man
