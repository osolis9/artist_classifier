Richest-Man-feat-Pitbull-:Play N Skillz
If I had a dollar every time I said you're pretty
I'll be the richest man in the world
And for every time you want it to leave me
I'll be the richest man in the world
If I have a dollar every time that you cheated
I'll be the richest girl in the world
And for every time I didn't believed you
I'll be the richest girl in the world

I'll be the richest man, you'll be the richest girl Today is the day you said to me you're through
'Cause you believe in innocence but you know I can make you true
If I had a dollar every time I feel like
I wanna disappear like I count the feel
Go around the world have no feel
Buy a different car have no pill
House on a hill
He's the past I might screw it up
But now I slow it down like I screw it up
Oh, no human can't judge me still around so I know you love me

If you got more than a dollar put your hands up, hands up
You know talking to you, put your hands up, hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh
Thanks to you I've got money to blow

I'll be the richest man, you'll be the richest girl Get go you should be the whisper for her
But now I'll be the burst without you
Don't make me stick it in your ear
Fuck with you her, mhm oh
If you had a dollar for every time that I cheated
You'd probably be rich
But not in my city just a reminiscence from Miami beach
Party's man got another woman and party's women got another man
Yeah, when I'm looking to the future yeah 3000

If you got more than a dollar put your hands up, hands up
You know talking to you, put your hands up, hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh
Thanks to you I've got money to blow
