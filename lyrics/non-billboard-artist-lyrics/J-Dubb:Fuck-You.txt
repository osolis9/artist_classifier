Fuck-You:J-Dubb
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
I'd like to dedicate this to all my haters
All my ex girlfriends
And everybody else I didn't believe

And don't know... shit
I just wanna tell you all
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

I hate that I gotta cut you off my nigga
Man you was my dog
For you I'd give my right paw, found out you was straw
Should have knew it all along
You said you would die for a nigga, ride for a nigga
Till the 4 wheels fall off
And the spare tire, instead of being higher
You wanna see a nigga fall off
They say blood is thicker than water
But how when mud is in your water
That mean we done been through the dirt
But shit, what's worse
For my blood I made blood shed
My blood wanna see me underneath the dirt
For yourself, you made shit worse
With or without you, I made shit work
When you bite the hand that feeds you
That take away your plate
But on lying homie you was a snake
I used to throw rats in your cage
How you gonna stab me in the back
Look me in the eyes and lie right in my face
I should draw on a nigga like a pencil
Walking around like it can't be erased
All that jealousy and that hatred
Just let me know you mistreated
As a bitch tratin you take it
Up the ass homie, that's gay shit
You a fagot mad that I made it
I'm just used to all of this fake shit
I've just learned to embrace it
I swear the haters can't break this
Scheming out, being uncomfortable,
And I'm living my life, you would die to beat me
Flexin over teks tweeting tough
But you sweet as fuck and cry if you see me
This is something I gotta do
Even know I really didn't want to
Due to the fact that I loved you
I don't hate you but it's

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

Shittin on a nigga, now you want me back
But there's no us and you want my trust
How the fuck is that
Wanna work shit out, wanna work it out
Bitch go to the gym
Wanna come running back to me
Cause that shit didn't worked out with him
That's who you left me for, before you opened that door and walked out
Should have thought about that,
Now it's too late bitch, you lost up
Had a good nigga in your life girl I was down for you
Now when you call my phone
You get the dial tone
...before all my problems down to being that long
We been through them ups and downs, life's a down jones
And my new one, she makes me smell more
So now on, just fuck you, fuck you
That's for friends I don't want too
So girl I don't want you, what we had it's gonn haunt you
This is something I gotta do
Even know I really didn't want to
Due to the fact that I loved you
But right now I don't even wanna

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
