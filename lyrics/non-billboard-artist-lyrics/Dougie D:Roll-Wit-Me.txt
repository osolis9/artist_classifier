I'm so glad to be back in my city
Where my reallas got change
And the fact gone remain we got baggets, Princess Cuts and
playin' solitaire

Frigga my realla is something I might wear
Matching socks at all time wit matching underwear
We hold it down my realla John, Lil' Ben and mob too many
C.E.O. might be gone but his spirit still up in me
I don't know (man), what y'all illas been told
But I'm pretty and that's all I can be
So when you see me out, jump me the deuce cause my team
Don't take two kind of you haters and look mean
In the Mustang nupe in the front so we shade
Police on my team so you know they don't hate
