Young nigga killed him judging by versace
Broad daylight they don't care who watchin'
On the corner surfin on the street light
Before you gon' approach Better think twice
The young nigga wildin' out here for respect
They do what ever gotta they do, To get their check
Young nigga got the fan blowing, Cooking crack
In a trashed [?] old-school parked in the back
