Possessed:Akir
My Emmanuel impaled dealing with hell 
Heaven’s a promise 
Islamic brothers deal and rebel 
What is the truth 
Execute 
System or jail 
I am the prism in your system 
Flow and be well 
I never drown I resound the sound I exhale 
I prevail through the challenge 
Balance the scales 
Snakes, fresh fish,desperate looking for sales 
I am the next shit 
player 
invoice in the mail 
No need for your proceed I am a male 
You just a pretty bitch 
Ugly when you doin well 
Tell by my intel ask for excel 
Spreadsheets on the concrete where I once exceled 
Drug dealers, killers, gangsters that your favorites know 
But they kept it funky never ever made the show 
Kept it low and away from their favorite guy 
Hoping that we gonna make it to a stable grind 
My time my decision the light I’m given 
Got shine more brighter then your hyper children 
This defined space to resonate in myspace 
slowem down to face a book dealing in a time race 

Im possessed to the top can’t get enough 
But I’m down for the people never giving up 
Keep it smooth attitude when the getting’s rough 
Always keep it real 
n&$%a I'ma call your bluff 
got’s to get got’s got’s to get it 
I’m possessed (4x) 

Emancipated from current reign though we endure the pain 
Maintain the urgent aim focused to make gain Man 
I sustain doin the damn thing 
While politicians is bullshittin they campaigns naw mean 
Chillin in the hood get a ticket 
F#%$#as get percentage from N%$as thats slippin dig it 
I get the feeling this is 
To fight the true resistance 
The people song is alarm for a true commitment 
Getting busy in the city 
Aint nobody fuckin with me 
That’s how I feel revealin 
all the spirits thats [email protected]%#$in with me 
I catch the holy ghost and ride it to the cemetery 
To meet with ancestors tryin to find vibe buried 
Never impressed when the press says its good lookin 
Been through it all from a boss to a new rookie 
No need to floss got game to get you hooked in 
God is the word I’m the truth there is no booking 

Im possessed to the top can’t get enough 
But I’m down for the people never giving up 
Keep it smooth attitude when the getting’s rough 
Always keep it real 
n&$%a I'ma call your bluff 
got’s to get got’s got’s to get it 
I’m possessed (4x)
