Let-Me-Hold-You-Down:Bow Wow
This what you need to do girl
Let me hold you

I been watching you for a minute, come through here so sweet scented
In life girl you need me in it, I'm determined to win it
I know what you need, I know what's wrong
I know how to make it tight, everything will be all right

If ya let me hold you and introduce you to my world
And introduce you to the better side of life that you ain't been seeing girl
I'ma show you where it's at and I'ma show you how to get it
All you got do is be wit it and let me hold you

Down like a real mans supposed to I never would have approached you
If I ain't have intentions on doing good, see dude you wit is so fooled
To me girl your so cool and all I'm asking you to do is let me hold you
Down like a best friend and two homies in the game

When you cry I wanna feel your pain no secrets, no games
All excitement, nothing plain, keep you happy
That's my aim
And all you gotta do girl is let me hold you

In my arms, in my mind all the time
I wanna keep you right by my side till I die
I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everything is right wit you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you

Down like a real friends supposed to
I'm trying to show you the life
Of somebody like you should be living, ooh baby baby
You could never go wrong, if you let me hold you

I'ma keep you up on what's popping and shake you fresh to death
When we hit the mall we can ball till theres no more left
I know you ain't used to it but you gon' get used to it
'Cause that's the only way I'm a do you and just

All my homies think I'm tripping 'cause I got you a pad
See they just mad 'cause they ain't get you, they ain't get you
Scorpio is your sign and girl your so fine
And I would do whatever in no time let me hold you

No shine, it's what your coming with but I'ma change all that
Rearrange that, put you in the range all black
With the rims to match phone attached, TV's in the back
How you gon' say no to that? Huh let me hold you

Niggas, look at me like now here you go really 'bout to blow some doe
But ain't nobody did it before so why is you so go hold it
'Cause I believe this was meant to be, I just gotta work at it
Like a crack attic up in rehab

In my arms, in my mind all the time
I wanna keep you right by my side till I die
I'm gonna hold you down and make sure everything is right wit you
You can never go wrong if you, let me hold you

Down like a real friends supposed to
I'm trying to show you the life
Of somebody like you should be living, ooh baby baby
You could never go wrong if you, let me hold you

Down down around, Atlanta Lanta
Fah found and everybody know now what I'm tryin do
I say down down around, Atlanta Lanta, fah found
I'm just tryin' get you to, let me hold you

Down down around, Atlanta Lanta
