Verse 1(B-rock)

Used to be a player now I got a wifey
Done havn night stands
now I know where ma life is
done havn side chicks
now I know who I can
share my life with
loving you to the end
used to havn cold nights durin winter times
having lonely nights
now she is by my side
meetin u wasn't part of the plan
but mearnt to be
mearnt to be
u the love of my life
oxygen to my lungs
heartbeat to my life
modern romeo and juliet
modern new bonnie and clyde
moonlight to my darkest night
long as you by my side
promise to love you 
till the end of the time

always on my mind
you the love of my life
the joy of ma heart 
no need to hesitate

heart beat to my life
other girls to the side
they can hate while we ride
coz I know we forever

Verse 2( B-rock)

cheers to the new life
drink to the new love
my baby by ma side
2k14 wen we ride
ratchets to the side
to the single life goodbye
its a cold world
but I knw will survive
nothing will ever come between us
coz we strong
nothing will ever make me leave
I will never be gone
am committed to you like trump to the money
like a bee to a bee nest she is ma honey
a break to the money
she is whats on my mind
like sandhill cranes
I swear she is all I got
floating through life
like ducks to the water
never get enough of each other
we forever

will survive
will survive
will live
