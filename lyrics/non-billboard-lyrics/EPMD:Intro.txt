Intro:EPMD
EPMD
Erick and Parrish Millennium Ducats
Squadron, uh, huh

Hah let me introduce my DJ Scratch the black Balboa
I'm Erick Sermon the dope rhyme blower
My DJ Scratchatori interesting like war stories
With EPMD the fame and the glory

The Boy Wonder the second nature the Arnold Schwarzenegger
'The Eraser' upon the crossfader
From Brooklyn Albany Projects
Been around the world with the DJ sets, catchin' wreck

Yo the track drives me to excel
Scratch is dangerous like a third rail
Got the feel like braille, stayed charged like a Duracell
The show-stopper, knockin' cats out like rock 'em, sock'em

Can't stop him, so playa hatin' is your only option
Hands quicker than Roy Jones with no headphones
BK Albany PJ's where my man zone
EPMD and Scratch, the quarterback
Meltin' wax, flippin' more tracks than Amtrak

'Cause I'ma, 'cause I'ma, 'cause I'ma
'Cause I'ma break it down to the nitty gritty one time
When it comes to the, I gets busy with mine
It's on now baby
