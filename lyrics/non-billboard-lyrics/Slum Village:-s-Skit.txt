-s-Skit:Slum Village
{FM 92. 2002, you in the mid-day cruisin' fair
With the fabulous, marvelous Marv, get down
To Marley, Marley, shrimp shack, boogie star
That was Detroit zoom Slum Village you just heard on your dial}

{And only on this station you gonna hear somethin'
Ya ain't heard in a while, R.J.'s latest arrival
Performin' live tonight at the Raw Little Cafe
Tickets on sale right now and they goin' pretty fast}

{I gotta couple right here for the seventh caller
Give me a call and get your front row seats
To a blast from the past, ladies free until 9, ya better
Ya better get down here 'cause they lookin' so fly}

I saw this guy, he caught my eye in the nick of time
He was so fly, I saw you round my way, just the other day
You were damn fine, you made me lose my mind
In the nick of time, you were too fly, now lady

Me and T3, little men lookin' at your ass
And it was so wide, you don't know what you did
When you walked past with your fine ass
Now lady, somethin' very special girl

Doin' somethin' special when gangsta girls fly
When she step onto the party, catch all the guys eye
Jump into the Maserati, she's a real fly hottie
She's the type of girl that you want her body
