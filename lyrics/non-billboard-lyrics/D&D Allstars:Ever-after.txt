Ever-after:D&D Allstars
Easy come and easy go
Has never been the case
Dreams of you are hard to erase

Call me crazy
Call me mad
Call me what you will
But I'm sane enough
To know that I love you still

They say that life goes on
But I've been dead since you've been gone
I think they were wrong
So who's the fool

I am ever after you
Always ever after you
Just tell me what I have to do
Is there a way
To be happy ever after you?

There is no psychology
And no amount of prayers
That can cure the pain when you're not there

Cause this is not supposed to be
How our love should look
After you have closed the story book

They say that life goes on
But I've been dead since you've been gone
I think they were wrong
So whats the use

I am ever after you
Always ever after you
Is there a way
To be happy ever after you

Reach out (3x)
(3x)

I'm not going anywhere.
Cause I am ever after you
Always ever after you
Tell me what I have to do
Is there a way
To be happy ever after you
