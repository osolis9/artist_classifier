Why-They-Hatin-:Bow Wow
Yeah (4x)

[Chorus:]
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause my bankroll stupid
They just mad cause they can't do it like I do it sucka nigga
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I done seen and done it all, you know my moddo I'm a ball 'till I fall what it is?
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I'm sittin on top, put my CD on they want me to stop but I'm not
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause all that shit I know y'all smell it and they sayin I ain't got it if you let them hata's tell it

[Verse 1:]
The King of the countdown who rollin' with the price now
Still make the ladies get wet like a deck town
Cool as I ever been, hip hop veteran
Ain't another 23 year-old who do it better than
Mr. Mars put the floss on all y'all niggas
I-I ball hard I'm like John Water y'all niggas uh
Lookin' at my resume, guess it's clearly to say
Just the thought of my accomplishments will make em want to hate
Closest thing to Will Smith, modern day Fresh Prince
Still leave a mic burnin like a fuckin insent uh
It's hard to handle all these groupie hoe's
And I could retire off of one of my movie rolls

[Chorus:]
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause my bankroll stupid
They just mad cause they can't do it like I do it sucka nigga
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I done seen and done it all, you know my moddo I'm a ball 'till I fall what it is?
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I'm sittin on top, put my CD on they want me to stop but I'm not
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause all that shit I know y'all smell it and they sayin I ain't got it if you let them hata's tell it

[Verse 2:]
I'll remain on top whether you like it or not
Toppin' every single chart from R&B rap to pop
Homie get on your grind, why you hatin' on mine?
I've been stackin' all this paper ever since I was five
Stuntin' plaques on my wall mane, goin' down my hallways
Cash Money, Young Money a-a-always
Sellin' our arenas
Packin' out the Garden
Message to y'all sucka niggas fuck 'bout what y'all talkin'
I keep girls in my jacuzzi, a mil' for every movie
Like what the fuck y'all talkin' 'bout, can't nobody out-do me oh yeah
And it's hard to handle all these groupie hoe's
And I could retire off of one of my movie rolls

[Chorus:]
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause my bankroll stupid
They just mad cause they can't do it like I do it sucka nigga
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I done seen and done it all, you know my moddo I'm a ball 'till I fall what it is?
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I'm sittin on top, put my CD on they want me to stop but I'm not
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause all that shit I know y'all smell it and they sayin I ain't got it if you let them hata's tell it

[Interlude: x2]
They want to see me fail, they want to see me fall
My mama raised a man, so I'm a stand tall
Got my mind on this money. Uh huh (wh-wh-wh-whatcha mind on)
Got my mind on this money. Uh huh (wh-wh-wh-whatcha mind on)

[Chorus:]
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause my bankroll stupid
They just mad cause they can't do it like I do it sucka nigga
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I done seen and done it all, you know my moddo I'm a ball 'till I fall what it is?
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause I'm sittin on top, put my CD on they want me to stop but I'm not
Hey why they hatin on you Bow?
'Cause all that shit I know y'all smell it and they sayin I ain't got it if you let them hata's tell it
