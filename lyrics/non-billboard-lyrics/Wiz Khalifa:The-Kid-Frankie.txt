The-Kid-Frankie:Wiz Khalifa
Yeah, Kid Frankie

I live life sucka free
That's why them niggas you be with
Talk down like they don't fuck with me
I get money realistically
And the homies show me love

Groupies wanna leave tha club with me
Ain't nothin' to a G
Let your hair blow in the breeze
Roll some bomb ass weed
Get high, cruise at a jet speed

Do it like I do it for TV
675 damier LV's, 7 something with tax
And when I'm on the plane
Got the carry on to match, nigga that's fly shit
Tryin' to peep game lil' homie just watch this

Champagne in my cockpit
Talkin' 'bout you got a man, mommy just stop it
Please, as we proceed to give you watchu need
To roll up our weed

You out here talking it, I'm out here livin' it
(Out here livin' it)
Niggas know we doin' our thing
'Cause we out here gettin' it
(Out here gettin' it)

But I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
(Gang, gang)
Ain't nothin' changed
(Nothin' changed)
Still rep the gang
(Still rep the gang)
Okay

Self-made been through what I been through
So I know what I know, I write bomb rap songs
Tell them bitches what I'm in to so the hoes wanna roll
First class roll to another coast

Just to smoke kush, I know a nigga who grows
And that's on the real momma
If you tryin' to slide gotta bring one for Will
Just another day in the life
'Nother plane, 'nother night
Gettin' faded with another nigga wife

Drinkin' hella champagne, Tanqueray with the Sprite
Then I'm up in the AM to catch another flight
Niggas reppin' the gang
Simply because everything else lame

The fans want real niggas
Them hoes lookin' for change
I seen it all, player in the game
First they bitin' our flow
Now they jackin' our slang

You out here talking it, I'm out here livin' it
(Out here livin' it)
Niggas know we doin' our thing
'Cause we out here gettin' it
(Out here gettin' it)

But I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
(Gang, gang)
Ain't nothin' changed
(Nothin' changed)
Still rep the gang
(Still rep the gang)

So incredible, ha ha ha, if I do say so myself
My nigga germ on the boards
Yeah, he did that shit fool, yeah, ha ha ha, what up, Will?
Benji just got off that flight from Vegas, okay

Taylor Gang, over everything, rostrum records
That's how the fuck we do shit
Yeah, bitch, smoke somethin', Kush and Orange Juice nigga
Can't forget that, everything's Louis Vuitton on this
