So-Whassup:Jonell & Method Man
So wassup
(Jonell)

Don't try to cover it
It's already seen and shit
Save all the sentiment
For the one that you been goin around creepin with
I ain't trying to set you up
You've already messed it up
Things can't be cool with us
You want to act up, pack up, send your butt back to her
Your lies are not taking
All the mess that you making
I won't sit around waitin
For your fakin and your explanation

{Chorus}
So wassup (Wassup)
I've noticed you been takin her out (her out)
Said that shes a friend but shes not (she's not)
Took some time to figure it out
So wassup
Can't belive you brought her into my home (my home)
Where you both were all alone (alone)
Shoulda left that female alone
So wassup

Come on and tell me wassup (4xs)
(Wassup)
(I mean what's goin on)

In the mood to scream or shout
I don't wanna to work it out
You shoulda thought about what I would do
Put yourself in my shoes
Just want to let you know
It's time for me to let you go
Pack your bags get out the door
I had enough talkin can't take it no more
Your lies are not taking
All the mess that you making
I won't sit around waitin
For your fakin and your explanation

{Chorus}

{Redman}
Yo
It's like a MOP dog
How I'm downtown swingin
Or up at AU center Marsh Brown schemin
Any given Sunday you can check the wooly beamin
26 spinners check him if hes breathin
Jonell, girl said we fucked the swoo
but they were sluts to me and I make love to you
I don't cheat, I give orders
If it don't work I go postal
Now my back hand smackin the both you
Girl I pissed you off but I'm still hollerin
Now you in the heat of the night got Phil callin
Yeah I guess I'm back to bein a dog
Chasin fat women that's sixteen in the drawls
Baby I'm back like Carter with a new starter
At any girl you see me around that you brought her
I'd rather leave you than stay and sin
So sorry gotta go
I hear Craig and em, beat it

All the games you played with me (all the games)
Thought you were in love with me (were in love)
Thought it was supposed to be only you and me (only you and me)
Seems like only yesterday (yesterday)
We were so happy (happy)
But you started telling lies
And now you out my life

{Chorus} (x2)
