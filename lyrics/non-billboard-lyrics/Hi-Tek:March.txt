March:Hi-Tek
Aiyo Hi-Tek, I think we got some shit
To smack they ass around with this trip, nigga
Here we go, yeah, c'mon, yeah, let's go
I-I think it's long overdue that
We give it to niggas in a new way

Yeah, yeah
(March)
C'mon
Yeah
(March)
Let's go

Nah I think this shit is feeling so good
We just gon' keep it going
Stay with me

You better march
(Down here)
All my niggas march
(Down here)
C'mon, march
(Down here)
I like how this shit is going, check it, aiyo

Y'all niggas know what's up, what the fuck, aiyo
The god is back, motherfucker, get low
Creep on a nigga and back the heat slow
Shame that we caught you on the back street though

Peep though, better chill when I'm trying to speak, yo
Chop a nigga's shit until they white meat show
Hook right, never been this right before
Light speed, hop up in the white G-4

Huh, it's like shooting a free throw
When you see the bullet flying up out of my peephole
Stack that cake, nigga, bundle up the dough
Got a whole lot of gats around in my humble abode

Got a whole lot of crack for your corner the drug store
Better know how to act's what I carry the toast for
When you roll through the hood, you better run it 'round here
Where the heater will spark, because we march
(Down here)

When we on the strip, you know we march
(Down here)
You getting that money, you better march
(Down here)
If you a soldier, nigga, march down here

And if you walk the Crip, you better march
(Down here)
If you wiggle your back, you better march
(Down here)

Do the damn step bitch, march
(Down here)
We do it for the hood when we march
(Down here)
Rep it for the block, nigga, march

Huh, I've got a whole shitload
You know what it is, motherfucker
(Flipmode)

Don't ask me shit, why?
(When?)
What?
(How?)
The plan was sick, we on Aftermath now
Got money to get 'fore a nigga
(Sign out)

My nigga that's with me, motherfucker
(Ride out)
You know you a puss, I think you better
(Hide out)

Bitches in the club, I see they wanna
(Whyle out)
Hmm, now I see your whole scheme
We wreck the ship while you niggas blow steam

Blow something and create a whole new scene
It don't even matter, murk something, knahmean?
Police roaming in the back of the club
Act like we ain't got a gat in the club

You niggas better have respect
(Around here)
'Fore the eagle'll spark
That's how we march

When we on the strip, you know we march
(Down here)
You getting that money, you better march
(Down here)
If you a soldier, nigga, march down here

And if you walk the crip, you better march
(Down here)
If you wiggle your back, you better march
(Down here)

Do the damn step bitch, march
(Down here)
We do it for the hood when we march
(Down here)
Rep it for the block, nigga, march

Now throw your right arm
Straight out to the front like this
Act like it's on the steering wheel
Act like it's on the steering wheel
Act like it's on the steering wheel

Make your left arm sit up on that car window
Wrist so froze it looks unreal
Wrist so froze it looks unreal
I got a old school nickname, Chilly Chill

Check it, a lot of you niggas, see, your shit outdated
(You ain't know?)
Franchise player just got traded
Mad ice like a nigga just ice skated
Must blow, only if the 'dro, high graded
(March)

Up on the strip to my niggas migrated
Dry state, more they kinda dehydrated
Lion's Gate money, moving deals overrated
According to my mother friends I should've never made it

(March)
All my niggas just
(March)
Here we go

Take shit from a nigga like repo
Police look up in my little keyhole
Worried about all the shit we sold
Old news, nigga, shit about a week old

(March)
In the name of the paper we fold
Whatever you want
You niggas weak 'round here
We back the john and cock heat
(Down here)

When we on the strip, you know we march
(Down here)
You getting that money, you better march
(Down here)
If you a soldier, nigga, march down here

And if you walk the Crip, you better march
(Down here)
If you wiggle your back, you better march
(Down here)

Do the damn step bitch, march
(Down here)
We do it for the hood when we march
(Down here)
Rep it for the block, nigga, march
