Yo it's rule number one
If you wanna be my main girl
Gotta keep your hair tight
Toes right, yeah girl
You gotta be a girl who
Has a lot of virtue
Like to party in the club
But she go to church too

I need a chick who jet skis, sky dives, surf too
Boo you spit a verse too?
Nah, I don't deserve you
Yo I gotta have a chick that's with a blockbuster night
When we caught up in some beef
On a blockbuster fight

Additude is heavy pullin' stunts out of spite
Yo even when she heated shorty cussin' light
36-24-38, ha, give or take her size don't matter
Goals and ambitions gotta be a go-getter
Prada in the summer and gabbana in the winter

Yo I'm lookin' for a co-star tryin' to keep you closer
In my holster, like a thoroughbred supposed to I need a j-lo chick
Not worry about her, Chris, or Ben affleck
Yeah, I did a few flicks my chicks above average
No bad habits, no baggage from past trips
Workin' real hard part time taking classes
Girl I gotta give you credit so, here's my plastic
Yo, I need a chick that won't take nick for granted
A high class miss, like 5 MIC's, a classic
You wanna be my main girl? Roll in the range, girl?
In the rain girl? Someone to take my name girl

City chick, southern bail educated, college bound
Put you in the hottest gown in the hottest part of town
Move in, make love, sparks fly, burn it down
12 dozen rows of roses, for valentines
Birthdays, teddy bears, this the girl I'm tryin' to find

Someone I can shine with cookin' with my mom chick
Booby you the finest, your tenderness, your kindness
Money ain't a thing, keep the change
