Achy-Breaky-feat-Billy-Ray-Cyrus-:Buck 22
How's this shit happen?
Let me tell you BRC
It happened cause I happened to meet up with Billy Ray Cyrus
It happened cause I rang the alarm. and broke the silence
It happened cause I'm sippin' on that good Kentucky whiskey
It happened cause I'd rather be lucky, than good
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just dont think hed understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Baby, don't you say a thing, do just what you do
Got me stuck on you like liquor, I swear you're hundred proof
And if I forget to mention, you got my attention
The only thing I'm askin' you to do
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
I've been next to BRC, up on TMZ
Got everybody wonderin' who I am
Miley keeps twerkin', daddy's song is workin'
Now Billy sing that crazy again
(Wrecking Ball!) Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
