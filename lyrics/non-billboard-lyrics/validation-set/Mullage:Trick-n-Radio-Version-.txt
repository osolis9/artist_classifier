Trick-n-Radio-Version-:Mullage
Shawty ya know dat I got dat cash(cash)
You don't even have to ask(noo)
Have anything you want too(Too)
Cause I can make it rain on you
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got (Trickin trickin) if you got it
(Trickin trickin) if you got it watchu askin
Trickin if you got it (Trickin trickin) if you got it
(Trickin trickin) if you got it watchu askin

I'm on pilot, a walking piece of profit
And everybody know it ain't trickin if you got it
I'm diggin in my pocket while I'm sippin this bacardi
Might throw a couple dollaz
Hell plenty if ya smilin
Make it drizzle on ya body but I really ain't decided
Just feel as tho I gotta cause it really ain't an object
I'm scopin out your body while your bendin over poppin
Like damn don't stop it let me go back in my wallet

Yes, she so debonaire
The way her body moves I can't help but stop and stare
Pull a stack up out my pocket
And say can I touch you there
Without no underwear
Think that opposites they pair
Slide them on in da morning
I love how your performin
The more I made it ring
Her body organs kept on stormin
Long strokin from the center
Body quivers I deliver
Left a picture with a tip
I am something to remember

If you down for whatever tonight
Honey you can have whatever you like
And you don't gotta settle tonight
Cause it don't get no better tonight
Lil mama yeah she just my type
I've been waitin for this all my life (for this all my life)
C'mon baby let's take flight (so high)
Takin off tonight
Dat shawty she caught my eye
Like a Bentley on the light
Feel like I'm on the ride
So I'm trickin on the spot
Listen to me while I speak this pimpin on the rocks
Hey let's kick it up a notch lil mama give me whatcha got
I been checkin this one out
I love her dirty mouth
She say 'are you really spendin me benj-ez you talkin bout?
C'mon and take this route
This money you can't ignore
I say usually I don't do this but yep I pay for it
