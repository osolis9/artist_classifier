Every-Time-You-Go:Hoodie Allen
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Every time you go
I know, I know, I know
Every time you go
I know, I know, I know
Every time you go

I can play a little bit of keys
But I can’t really give you what you need
I graduated and you said that if I leave
It really wouldn’t be easy to put together the piece
So nowadays when I call you just to speak
I hear a lot of empty spaces in between
I see a lot of empty faces in your life
But I ain’t ever there to tell you that they just oughta peace

So if you’re really gone
It only gets better
I say I’m moving on
It only gets better
I try to fill it up
And I remember the stuff
That made us just wanna rush like fools would do
If you really gone
It only gets better
I say I’m moving on
It only gets better
And I start to believe that music is what I need
Now every story would need to end happily
(everytime you go…happily…)

And I know, this is hard, this is hard, this is real bad
Oh no real bad
Cuz I don’t even feel bad
I know know know, I know know know, I know know know, I know, I know
(Every time you go)

And I can play a little bit of “he said” “she said”
And I ain’t tryna kiss you when you smoking that wee-head
And I ain’t tryna miss you when I’m poking that bees nest
Tryna get that
Honey honey honey ooh honey ima do it again
Oh I’m mad cuz im thinking that we all cool
And now the only thing you’re thinking ‘bout is law school
And a situation that really doesn’t involve you
Well, then I’m a idiot

So if you’re really gone
It only gets better
I say I’m moving on
It only gets better
I try to fill it up
And I remember the stuff
That made us just wanna rush like fools would do?
If you really gone
It only gets better
I say I’m moving on
It only gets better
And I start to believe that music is what I need
Now every story would need to end happily

And I know, this is hard, this is hard, this is real bad
Oh no real bad
Cuz I don’t even feel bad
I know know know, I know know know, I know know know, I know, I know, I know

This is hard, this is hard, this is real bad
It’s real bad
I don’t even feel bad
I know know know, I know know know, I know, yeah I know
Every time you
