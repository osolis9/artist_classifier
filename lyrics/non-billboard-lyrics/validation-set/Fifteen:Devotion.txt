Devotion:Fifteen
The innocence of yesterday
So true, so sincere, so forgiven, but always waiting
It's filling our minds
With our dreams from yesterday
Our undying devotion
It's killing you, killing me
Our disbelief in the prospect
Of happiness
Together turns us away, turns us away
But I'm still watching you watching me
Remember how innocent we used to be
Lost in our joy so comfortably
Like a white rose stealin' your heart
For the moment
Adrian can you tell me
Can you tell me what did you see?
It was brown, it was brown
It was pink, it was white, so white
It was white, so white
Something I feel for you
That I can't exactly explain
It gets so confusing
I know you feel it too
All our inhibitions aside, I truly love you
So enchanted, watching your love shining through
Remember how innocent we used to be
Lost in our joy so comfortably
Like a white rose stealin' your heart
For the moment
Adrian can you tell me
Can you tell me what did you see?
It was brown, it was brown
It was pink, it was white
It was white...
So white...
