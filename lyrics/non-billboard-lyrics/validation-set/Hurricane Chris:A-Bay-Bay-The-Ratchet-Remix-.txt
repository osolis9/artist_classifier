[The Game:]
You can find me in tha a bay bay
Buckin full of cry-stale V.I.Ped up
Goin hard in body tap where they throw that cheeze up
I been about my paper niggas know about my stack
You dont like that dirty money send yo girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out
Im tha king of this rap shit f**k they talkin bout
Niggas cant sell records so they blame it on tha South
I be all through Shreve-port Louisiana ballin
Like who the f**k said aint no choppers in New Orleans
My rims so clean they spinnin like a world-wind
Pull up at the club bitches textin they girlfriends
They know who i is they know who i am
I be flyin through the south in that burgundy land
Pull up at the light my shit so bright
She want my number call me tonight
Pick up the phone like

[Chorus 2:]

A Peter Pan quick knock off the doors off
Dont get me started ive been retarded watch me mow down

[Chorus 1]

[E-40:]

Just like the Lava House click
"Pass Me Sum Wata"
Outta my mind outta my body thumper never loose
Rollin you can sip that Donald Duck orange juice
Mean muggs fix your face upside down smile
Money call the fete chase been doin it for a while
Phunk Dog on the beat with it jig with it
Hustlers play for keep with it so I keep my heat with it

[Chorus 2]
Say that red hat them red b`s white b`s

Hidin `hind the shades I been up for bout three days
{You already know what we say when we outta here what? a bay bay a bay bay you can find if you scared} [X2]

Wiastin drank everywhere cuz I cuz I don`t care
With my niggas out that lava and you know we bad off
We the ones up in tha cut with them blunts that make you cough
Chewed all the way down from my head to my feet

[Chorus 1]

[Hurricane Chris:]
Well its the H to tha U double R I C-A-N to tha E Get em up, Get em up, Get em up like
A bay bay thats what we say when we pull up in them trucks
Tell my label to cut the check ima gone spend it up
On the bentley painted yellow like a baby school bus
26's make em stop when i pull up
And my pants sag low like i was rockin a pull-up
When i stop and i pull up ima be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain ima snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at they lost i dont thank they on my level
Lil mama thank ima bite her with this alligator sweater
A bay bay was just the beginning im finna run tha game
Whoever feel different can holla at Hurricane
Wanna be talkin but heavy itenary break up yo chest if you runnin yo mouth
And every since i dropped that a bay bay i been runnin the South

[Chorus 1]

[Jadakiss:]
Yo look at any game 50 large is what I came with
25 for bottles 25 to make it rain with
This aint reggie miller ma this is cush and haze mixed
Don`t sit there and lie to me you aint never taste this
Hope the Lord forgive me gave my Jesus piece a face-lift
Stones is doin the y-toosie in the bracelet
Aint no stopping that I be where the gwap is at
Excuse me I be wherever its poppin at
Now im on the dance floor iced out lights out
Wifebeater true religion shorts and my nikes out
Drinkin out the bottle talking much shit Dutchlet
Every bunny with an arms reach wanna touch kiss
Back to the couch with a section full of honey dips
Black on 26 e-s we fresh
Yes and when I leave they all following just cuz I was in the club hollerin

[Chorus 2]
