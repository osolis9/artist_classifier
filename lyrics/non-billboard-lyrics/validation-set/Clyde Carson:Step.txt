I go blow and trow

In the middle of the dance floor
Now everybody let your hands go
Don't hold back mama move

(Groove)
So easy and so smooth
(Smooth)
We can get loose just
Put down ya drinks so we can 2 step

Baby I came to party, who you rubbin on?
Rock with me in the comfort zone
You know that 1, 2 step
With the left, right with the rhythm, go

Ya move like ya want it with me
Whether poppin' bottles with boys in the V.I.P.
Throwin shots with patron curkle
With the P.Y.T.'S
