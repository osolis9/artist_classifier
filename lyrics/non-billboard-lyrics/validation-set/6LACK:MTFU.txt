MTFU:6LACK
Black, black, black

Your friend was preying on our downfall
Baby swear she was waiting
I know I more than fucked up now I feel stupid
Why would I do this?

She know no better but I did
Poor decision making for the kids
And all because you left us for a second
And now I'm tryna figure out the lesson
Of all the people I fucked up on you
What the fuck was I supposed to do?
This shit is sticky, it's tricky and kind of hard to explain
Wanna refrain but being human is strange
Apologizing in advance for the pain

Your friend was preying on our downfall
Baby swear she was waiting
I know I more than fucked up now I feel stupid
Why would I do this?

I'm tryna tell you what it is
She came to the crib
Whispered in my ear
Some shit I wanna hear
And told me y'all ain't cool
We're finished, y'all are through
So then I took her word, didn't run that shit by you
I made myself believe everything was okay
Meanwhile she at your house, she smiling in your face
She smiling in your face but you don't even know
So I can't even say
