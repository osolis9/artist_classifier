Party-Like-a-Rock-Star-Remix:Shop Boyz
Party like a rock
Party like a rockstar I rock my body like a rockstar
Live like a movie star
Play like a all star
Fuck lke a porn star
Baby i'ma superstar
U can call me Pamela-Anderson
Plus i rock da stage Marilyn Manson
No hands-no skirt
look at me-i'ma flirt
I'm in da club poppin bottles
Lookin like a supermodel
Plus my gurlz r hella pretty
So dem bitches real sadity
attitude sometimes shitty
Rockstar chicks run da city
It's da rockstar extraordinaire
Throw ur hands in da air
Wave em like u jus don't care
Patron shots everywhere
Crash a party anywhere
If u don't like me, i don't care
I know u lookin, gone stare
I got haterz everywhere
Plus i'm da fast car
Kinda like Nascar
Da boyz screamin' Trina stop
But Trina screamin' Kidd Rock
Just found out I got a stalker
Ow my GOD it's Travis Parker
Told u i'ma superstar
Come party with a rockstar
Yea-it's da rockstar extraordinaire
And I wonna shout out all my motherfuckin rockstars
All ova da world
Rockstars in da building
I see you
El Boogie I see you
