I-Got-The-Power:Diddy
My click is in it 'til it's over, never sober
Bustin' over, layin' Elaine with the cane and the Rover
Pray to Jehovah for the nigga with the Ruger
The young Don, the heron mover

You know my hustle, I bring the fo' pound to the tussle
Motherfuckin' pit with no muzzle
So chill Cuzo, let me blow for my niggaz
Runnin' round and gettin' down like motherfuckin' gorillas

Shorty bop, the Wolop in the spot with the dollop
Pot full of acid, I got the game mastered
Move dimes, hit twenties addicted to gettin' money
It could be a hundred degrees and never look sunny

Black I'm tryin' to live, somethin' got to give
But every day's the same old runnin' from popo
Mom think I'm loco 'cause I sell crack and puff cocoa
Yo, it's the style see it's still the same
And when worse comes to worse, I steal the cane

Papi know my face so he don't expect it
But I'm from the gutter so he gots to accept it
Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him
He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him

I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept
I take my last breath every time I hit the meth
It's the D to the E, M to the O N
Blowin', steady playin' shotgun, throwin'

Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap?
Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat
Best to brace yo' gat 'fore I brace mine 'cause I lace nine
From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin' spine

I be that nigga that you niggaz can't fuck wit
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit
That nigga that you can't get along wit
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit

That nigga that you see in the videos
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes
That nigga that'll die for his main man
That nigga with the gettin' money game plan

Haven't you heard that the Bad Boys moved in silence yet?
When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get
I'm only sizin' you niggaz from the waist up
And I ain't wettin' no parts you can't touch with makeup

Mr. Jacob without the ladder
It don't matter, clap, you wake up and do a shakeup
Nobody badder, since the baby finksta
I was in the playpen waitin' for kids to enter

Shit, I even blitzed the rich to get chips
Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip
Extra clip in the vacuum if I slip

Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb
Blown to Hong Kong while I been long gone
Plus, I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?
Worldwide while you simply thugged where you lived at

I be that nigga that yo' niggaz can't fuck wit
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit
That nigga that you can't get along wit
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit

That nigga that you see in the videos
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes
That nigga that'll die for his main man
That nigga with the gettin' money game plan

You don't really wanna get involved, with the LOX car
Tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are
You can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us
Jealous dog 'cause we spread like relish

Bad Boys and we all eat together
When it go down then we draw heat together
Since I made the connection with the big man
I done got big plans to be a little nigga in the big land

Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped
And what you call weight? I know cats who sniff that
Enjoy life, what are you sayin'?
If the DA ain't got a nigga payin', Papi got him weighin'

Anything to do with money you can count J in
Next time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin'
Cream of the crop and we ain't never gon' stop
Hittin' you in your head with that butter from The Lox

I be that nigga that yo' niggaz can't fuck wit
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit
That nigga that you can't get along wit
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit

That nigga that you see in the videos
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes
That nigga that'll die for his main man
That nigga with the gettin' money game plan

Yeah yeah, I be that nigga, that nigga
That nigga that yo' niggaz can't fuck wit
