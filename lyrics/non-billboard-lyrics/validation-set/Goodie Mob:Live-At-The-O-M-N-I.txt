One million niggaz inside
You can't break me even though you try
One million niggaz inside
Even though you hit me with everything you got

One million niggaz inside
I still found truth even though you lied
One million niggaz inside
When the rest are runnin' on instinct

Let me tell you somethin' real
Plenty niggas sittin' in jail just to eat this decent meal
But see the rest they running on instinct
And the way they treat me today like they shit don't stank

Make me mad as fuck
And fo' dat a million niggas gone to tear Atlanta up
This that shit that I'd like to see, a gang of niggas
Working together to put the Devil straight to sleep

We sendin' his ass to the grave
Ain't no such thang as a nineteen-ninety-five slave
You brought that shit on yo'self
But fo' me from the beginning a fucked up hand was already dealt

I used to trust in my preacher
Now a days my mac-11 is my one and only teacher
Seems like you would listen to reasons
I guess Atlanta nuts are too deep in season

I went to jail fo' the cause and for the black police
We give 'em the sweat off my fuckin' balls
Suckin' on the Devil's dick already kissin' on his ass
Fo a ten dolla' raise, bitch
Beat me down fo' some petty cash, smilin' in my face
As the beast looked on and laughed O.M.N.I.

You can't break me even though you try
One million niggaz inside
Even though you hit me with everything you got

One million niggaz inside

On my nerves instinct has taken over
Which is makin' me move slower so I don't miss shit
So I don't get too high when I had to trust ya
You betrayed the crew and I had to bust ya

Wanna come back and take you
Worried about the wrong thang this paper ain't gon' get you far
They 'bout to start the revolution
Let you knew where they are and where they stand
They got the upper hand

Listen to the SWAT's, let me tell ya how it is man
You got closer and you realize what it is
We fighting each other in the streets of each
And you live and learn day by day, it could get worse

Picture me driving a hearse on the day after
Hit a joint from the kids, I saw that didn't notice me on the street
War was the vibe now I'm locked in this time
One million niggaz inside

One million niggaz inside
You can't break me even though you try
One million niggaz inside
Even though you hit me with everything you got

One million niggaz inside
I still found truth even though you lied
One million niggaz inside
When the rest are runnin' on instinct

Ain't no mo' you, ain't no mo' me
It's only us but no unity
Got yo' eyes open still can't see
You' soul is priceless but you'll die for free

Is it you don't know? Is it they don't show?
If it is, then realize them crackers don't owe you no explanation
Yo' hesitation to learn the truth will be yo' extermination

That's why we gotta put the bullshit to rest
Excuse me, I'm 'bout to get some shit off my chest
Niggas is still dying, it ain't no excuse
A.I.D.S. got it where the niggas can't reproduce

Niggas don't wanna listen when you tell it like it is
Can't even get his own 'cause you worried 'bout his
Regardless where you from, I'm your god damn brother
We ain't never ever gon' make it without each other

Seek and you'll find but we gon' stay lost until
One million niggas inside this frame of mind

One million niggaz inside
You can't break me even though you try
One million niggaz inside
Even though you hit me with everything you got

One million niggaz inside
I still found truth even though you lied
One million niggaz inside
When the rest are runnin' on instinct

Blue skies, sweatin' hot rain
Watching the floors fall is the game
Seeing one side of the Federal Building gone from the car
Came the storm right streets to Garnett filled to the curb

No where to go but lovejoy, can't exit off here
Got me trapped on your high concrete want me to speak
Took away Mosley and Maddox for the weekend
And kept me on your one way streets

For the arrestee show no pity, siege be under the city
Hidden eyes on poles that light my path
Mutant is the mind frame, one million nigga's showed up at your door
To get it on with the new clan coming live from tha [Incomprehensible]

One million niggaz inside
You can't break me even though you try
One million niggaz inside
Even though you hit me with everything you got

One million niggaz inside
I still found truth even though you lied
One million niggaz inside
When the rest are runnin' on instinct

One million niggaz inside
You can't break me even though you try

Even though you hit me with everything you got
