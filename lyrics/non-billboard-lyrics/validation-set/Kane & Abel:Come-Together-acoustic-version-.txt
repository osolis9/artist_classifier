Come-Together-acoustic-version-:Kane & Abel
I've got a thing for you,
I've got a thing for you
and I don't really mind.
I know a thing to do,
I know a thing to do
'cause we do over kind
Don't say no 'cause you don't understand
don't let go while I'm stealing your hands
I've got a thing for you,
I've got a thing for you
and is all in my skin
Don't say no, say this is unreal
don't let go 'cause you don't really feel
Come together, come together ohh
more than ever, more than ever.
I've got a thing for you, I've got a thing for
we don't have know what
All the things will do, yeah all the things will do
if you give it up .

once step closer now we gotta move on
Come together, come together ohh
more than ever, more than ever.
Don't say no 'cause you don't understand
don't let go while I'm stealing your hands.
I've got a thing for you,
I've got a thing for you.
Come together, come together ohh
more than ever, more than ever.
Come together, come together ohh
more than ever, more than ever.
Don't say no 'cause you don't understand
don't let go while I'm still in your hands.
Don't say no we got nothing to fear
don't let go our future is already here
