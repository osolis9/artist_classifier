(feat. Nas, Nature)

(Nature)
At the ripe age 24, I done seen it all done it all
Some dreams stay fresh and some are spoiled
Dealin with time went to spring, summer, fall
Its crazy changes, is this that made me famous?
I come a long way from Tims, minimum wages
Stockin caps summer jobs pockets flat
It's funny how my childhood idols now be copin cracks
Ain't knockin at them, fortunately life is too short to see
It's only right we move accordingly at every second
I use to carry heavy weapons, previously cocked
Tucked in my shirt for every session, but hold up
The two-six beer made me grow up
Came home to the damn same dream with no luck
And half the clique strong, the other half moved on
Some with new lives and new wives niggaz live long
The foulest thing about time is still ticks when you gone

(Nas)
For those who lived the way I lived we came from a long way
From wipin coal from our eye lids from raps hottest
Smokin lye to the track guidance, 'member back then
Before Mack 10's expensive bottles, had a sick mind
Niggaz taught me how to get mine
We often sit courts they get tossed that get spit line
To all niggaz that the Lord seemed to legit time
Why we plan to live for-ev he had a different design
Is it safe to say we all parish on the sacred day
With my luck soon as I reach the gate that made me pay... pray
Minutes go by indo-go-high the specialist decked out dark specks finessin
Used to play catch a kiss same girls back then now leave us messages
A whole lot, travel to my old spot where we sold rock although its trifle
Ain't nothin changed as like time is all a cycle

Yo, wake up to the world stay in charge of your dream
Keep your vision focus get wise and large your cream
Marketin scheme so many in the dark it's un-seemed
Caught up between perhaps rap was a fortunate thing
Forced to be king from hustlin to supportin them fiends
Bustin guns, I had no remorse as a team
Rockin bird stones my first get big nursed a dome
Its hurts to zone now I realize I'm on the surface alone
Time ticks devilish mind design quits leave you line quick
And cause you to die behind shit, mathematics
Master 120 I'm Aziatic, I'm amazed with magic
Cousins with loosen that made me savage
Life changed once you established with the right game
Love the night vane found the new way to fight pain
Clocks never stop, its all the way to the top
Trying to freeze time that's why I iced the face on my watch
