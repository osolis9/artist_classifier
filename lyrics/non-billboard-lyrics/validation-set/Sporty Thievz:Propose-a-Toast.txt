Propose-a-Toast:Sporty Thievz
To the one who we all love the most, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This joint is dedicated to everybody dead and gone
Everybody gettin' it on, everybody locked up
Everybody on the curb, everybody in the struggle
It's gon' be aight, we proposin' a toast for all a y'all
This one's for y'all man, for everybody, yo

I neva know when it's my last shot to hug my pops
A smart, hard workin' mechanic, who loved his shop
Always told me he lookin' out on what's best for me
And use the best of my discretion on my destiny

And all during this phase, you expected straight A's
I had F's, absences and thirty late days
I understood you thought about puttin' your son in the car
Dad, you know I'm sorry, you had to find that gun in my drawer

But why order me, tell me school was top priority
Givin' mad hints, thinkin' like it's got to more to me
Comin' home from work, sometime ya mood was stable
Stressed out, just able to keep food on the table

And the way you handle things was like Marlon, I'm here to help
Moms be like I'm yellin' for my health wit a belt
I'm tryna share this wealth besides my mom and my girl
I propose this toast to the greatest dad in the world

Propose a toast if they here or not here
All my niggas throw them bottles in the mothafuckin' air
Dead and gone or alive gettin' it on
Coast to coast, propose a toast and God Bless
(We propose a toast to those all the ones we love the most)

Propose a toast if they here or not here

(What's up Hap, chillin?)
Same ol', same ol', you know
Tryna turn this block into a volcano
Blow it up, sayin' though, what's up wit you?
How's the crew and mom dukes
(They aight)

True, true, me well, you know my moms died
It's aight, go 'head and cry
You get over it as time flies, I did
(Tears slid from his eyelid, he got silent then he said violent)
My mom's is all I had

Time to pick the clip up, and do stick ups
To cream whip up and somethin's triple up
Been skippin' up all nickeled up
Neck icecicled up, best part is

Yo, I don't give a fuck, Kirk, you still rhymin'
I see you got diamonds look like sales is climbin'
Nigga, look at you smilin', Kirk before I go, let me give this a cross
At my wake, have my shirt off and two bottles of Smirnoff
Propose me a toast, I love you, adios

Propose a toast if they here or not here
All my niggas throw them bottles in the mothafuckin' air
Dead and gone or alive gettin' it on
Coast to coast, propose a toast and God Bless

You was that nigga B and I miss you to death
I couldn't maintain the pain when you left, every breath
A real nigga to the bone but God called you home
I know you B, know you oversea watchin' over me
We became cool when I used to cut school

You were there to care, told me that my peoples upstairs
Lookin' out for me and it wasn't even on yet
Comin' home wit freaks, I'm like Gene, are they gone yet?
Gave me the green light dude, go 'head and bang
I ring ya buzzer if they come back, so do ya thang

From there on it was gravy, the wreckin' crew makin' hits
Shit spittin' in ya crib all crazy, ain't enough balls to express
Holdin' stress, never the less, Gene, you was the mothafuckin' best
So I bring it to a closing, them bitch niggas stopped ya time
But they can't stop this toast I'm proposin'

Propose a toast if they here or not here
All my niggas throw them bottles in the mothafuckin' air
Dead and gone or alive gettin' it on
Coast to coast, propose a toast and God Bless
(We propose a toast to those all the ones we love the most)
