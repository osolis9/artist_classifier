Things-You-Do:Loon
Ah, hey, baby, ah
I like, hey, hey, I like
Oh, I like ya baby, I like
Ah, hey, baby, I like, yea

Check it out
There was a reason I like you
And there's a reason I wifed you
'Cuz I never seen nothin' like you
So sweet, my team even like you
There's no limit to the things that I might do

And that's why you stay in the finest
Everything major, never in the minors
We dine on yachts, far from them diners
I'm by your side far from behind ya

And I ain't gotta buy cars to remind ya
Gas you up and put your heart in the grinder
You don't know what you mean to me, girl
'Cuz you more like a queen to me

And I want you to cling to me
'Cuz you came here, you changed my scenery
It was just like a dream to me, that's what it seemed to be
You need a ring, it not a thing to me

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you

Girl, you are my lover
When I'm with you, there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave
I'm on my hands and knees

And now I'm back by popular demand
Rocks is in your hand, so let 'em know, girl, you gotta man
Even though you know I got a lot of fans
See me in the club with the bottles in my hand

Models on the side tryin' to holla if they can
Get a nigga home, try to swallow if they can
But you know they can't holla at your man
I'm focused so they can't bother without plans

White sand, we done, did that
London, did that, Sandrope, we done, did that
Went to Sydney and dropped dough
Trips to Morocco, Paris popped more, we did that

So ain't nothin' else left to do
But spend the rest of my life and invest in you
I know them haters be testin' you
But don't let nobody stress you, boo
You know they like that

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
The feelings good things from you, girl

Aeyo, now that we made our bond
It might sound crazy, ma, but it's time to get our baby on
It's time to get a life together
'Cuz you gon be my wife forever

'Cuz I made up my mind, it's crazy at times
Visions of you and a baby of mine
Half the hassle, livin' in half a castle
There's no way to act or pass you

I'm blessed to have you, pain that I loved done last through
Can't nothin in the world surpass you
I have to ask you, please be my only girl
I can't breathe in this lonely world

'Cuz I'm often hounded, concerts surrounded
By chicks that think Loon is astounding
But without you, ma, Loon won't be grounded
Loon would be runnin' round clownin'

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way the feelings good things from you, girl

I like the way you wear your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
Way you kiss me I feel warm
Give me all your lovin' all night long

I like the things you do to me
I like, it brings out ecstasy
I like, you really turn me on
I like, I like the way
