I-m-Back-Clean-:Lil Scrappy
I can't hear y'all turn it up
Mother*** didn't know I was gonna go crazy over here

I'm back, hotter than a *** in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell

I'm back, hotter than a *** in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell, well I'm back

Click clack, tha prince is back
Even tho I been here I still owe y'all that
A *** been low key, but I'm off da rack
Just off da corner sold [Incomprehensible], now I'm back to ***

Had to get some new [Incomprehensible] and some even bigger [Incomprehensible]
Movin' in and out of [Incomprehensible] like I'm still on the run
Got my vest on shawty, and I'm strappin' a ton
Ev'rythang all good 'cause I'm ** with Jon

That's where, a *** straight fell to the airport
Bought 2 first class seats to New York
To see if I could go and ball in the same coat
Me and my *** both, two *** we toat

A *** was weak, now the goon is woke
Ain't even no question about the nines I roll
Got hit with a bottle and I still got flow
BME and G-unit, that's all she wrote

I'm back, hotter than a *** in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell

I'm back, hotter than a *** in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell, well I'm back

On behalf of the first verse, ya know I'm coming
Still deep in the club with my *** thumpin'
Every show I do, ya know I have um' screaming and jumpin'
Ya *** still hatin' but ya know they be poppin',

Through the course of this album, ya your boy dun went through it
Like getting pushed off the stage by the *** station
I dunno what the hell wrong with all these pigs
Another *** touch me and I'm gonna sue him again

He might have been broke, I gotta raise these kids
I don't think some of y'all know what you're playin' with
Had a sick manager who took my benefit
*** with violator now that picture look real big

On some real ***, my *** Vic gon' be rich
Pray to God forgive him for the dirt that he did
When I wasn't on TV you forgot about me
I took it upon myself to remind you 'bout me

I'm back, hotter than a *** in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell

I'm back, hotter than a *** in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit, da crowd gon' yell, well I'm back
