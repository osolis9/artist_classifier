Look Into My Eyes (Atlantis Remix)
[Krayzie Bone]
We thuggish ruggish niggas always
And ready to bring the war if you hate [x2]

[Bizzy Bone]
Comin' through the door with my militia
Why did he bring big niggas
Fuck y'all
With of gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas 
Dippin' off in limos and bitch y'all just maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money
But my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang you know me
Homies got mo' love
And the biz follow all of my senses
Pump my fist for Mo' Thug
Got to keep the lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me is roll of a loco soul
But load a revolver, hold up
Now buck 'em all to hell 'cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much
No luck you get blowed up
All of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs 'cause y'all think you can really hate

(Hook)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would ya look into my eyes
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could ya tell me what you see

[Krayzie Bone]
What makes a nigga think
He bite my shit and call his shit original
What's worse
Tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin' years ago
And that's just like a nigga want to take all the credit
I bet it 
Didn't even occur that we would eventually
Meet with ya don't crash, collide lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga name and all that
But all y'all fin to get scarred
Woosh let 'em loose
And they heard the news ya run up ya could get dead
Oh, uh-huh, hey we murder motherfuckers in a daily way
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
Oh shit get down Leatherface
Fuck 'em all if I can't get my respect
C'mon now put them to rest
With a bloody, bloody mess
But nevertheless we won't stress
I figure this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all on your mind but
In time you find we as real as we speak

(Hook)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would ya look into my eyes
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could ya tell me what you see

[Layzie Bone]
All I see is a souljah
Pistol in holster
Givin' you the most
I toast to them thugs
Nigga nothin' but the love and bud that we brung
To the table and a nigga wanna test
Catch slugs put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit
Mo' murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas on top with the roughness
Nigga and it's war when you craft these Bones
We can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who you are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since '93
Shuttin' shit down in the industry
Nigga can you buy that
I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros
And make friend of foes
But we chosen
God done blessed us with his potion
Pure devotion freely spoken baby
Niggas can't see us never
Stay together my clique too clever
Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather
Remeber eternal it means forever lastin'
#1 Assassin blastin', mashin' on all you niggas what I'm doin'
All of the heavens gonna be rulin'
Trues when we come we won't be losin'
Provin' 'em wrong

(Hook)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would ya look into my eyes
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could ya tell me what you see

[Wish Bone]
I see five killa realer ready to roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger smother a nigga
Put 'em in a river we the killers and that's for sure
Niggas out there clowin' mine
And you can't rhyme
The style you got is all mine
And when I see you bitch I'm goin' in your pockets double time
And it's like that
You don't want that
Come and get some pap pap
Wanna sound like
Wanna be like
Nigga we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone's shit
Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin'
Tryin' to make somethin' out of nothin'
Fuck it let's peel your caps
Buck 'em all now put 'em in check 
Fuck 'em up with the .44 mag
I'm glad 'cause when you're fuckin' with Bone
We're sending 'em home in a bodybag
Now look into my eyes bet you see
A realer killa thug puttin' it down with harmony

(Hook)
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would ya look into my eyes
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could ya tell me what you see [x2]
