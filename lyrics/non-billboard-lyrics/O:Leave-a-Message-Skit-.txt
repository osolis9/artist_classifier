Leave-a-Message-Skit-:O
I wanna hear your voice
But I don't wanna respond
Don't really have a choice
Just kinda hit me that you're gone
Haven't spoke for a minute
I been barely living
(I been)
It only feels so fitting
The only care that you were given is the loving that I'm currently missing
We made your wifi code and it's saved to my phone
Sometimes I type it in the dots just to check if I'm home
Just like E.T. the stars on your ceiling reflect my glow in the dark heart
While it's beating and I'm bleeding out
We were bout that scream and shout
But what was it that we screamed about?
With or without
Couldn't figure what would sting worse
Always wondered who would leave first
Leave a message
When no one else is near you
So no one else can hear you
Tell me everything
Leave a message
When there's no one else around
I don't want to hear it now but can't seem to turn you down
Leave a.
Sorry I lost you but I got something to say before I leave
I'm sorry that I miss you
But it's cool, get to see you in my dreams
Thanks for showing me how love feels
Thanks for showing me how loss feels too
Thanks for making me strong when things fall apart
Thanks for the try, at least we had a good start
Just wanted to hold you down, but you put me on hold
And I gave you all my heart
And I gave you my soul
Baby every little thing is going to be all right
You'll always be on my mind
Can't always be in my life
I know one day you'll smile with all the happy you need
I hope one day you'll smile with all that happy at me
One day you'll see everything in you that I see
And I hope one day you'll be as happy as you pretend to be

There's ideas we had, that we no longer know
There's places we've been, that we no longer go
There's things we learn, that we don't want to know
And there's people we love,
That we have to let go
