Wonderman-Live-:Tinie Tempah
[Tinie Tempah]
These haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol, uh
My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful, uh
What kinda person should you be when wanna make people accept you, uh
What does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful,
When you were born to be special,
Uh yeh and I went from the kid in class,
Text some radio DJs so they could bring me up
To the young rapper that everybody's ringing up,
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust
Mad thoughts in my head when its blowin up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans
Cement for sand
Raise your hand
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

[Tinie Tempah]
Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall and cant afford a pair of trainers,
Imagine when it changes, imagine satisfaction when you make it,
Its more than being famous,
More then the applause and more than any form of status,
More than the performances in 20 foreign places,
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises,
Amen hallelujah "Tinie look what's happened to ya?"
Yeh they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeh

And when the fans start grabbing you,
Show gratitude with a little brag or two,
Amen, hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya,
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran, look
I traded friends for fans,
Cement for sand,
Raise your hand,
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding - Chorus]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

Come on come on the stars are where you belong
Come on come on follow your heart is gunna take you home
Come on come on the stars are where you belong
There's no turning back from here

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman
