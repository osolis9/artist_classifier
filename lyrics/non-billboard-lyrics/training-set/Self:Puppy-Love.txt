Puppy-Love:Self
And they called it puppy love
Oh i guess they'll never know
How a young heart how it really feels
And why i love her so

And they called it puppy love
Just because we're seventeen
Tell them all oh please tell it isn't fair
To take away my only dream

I cry each night these tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I'll pray that baby some day
You'll be back in my arms once again

Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above
How can i oh how can i tell them
This is not a puppy love

Someone help me, help me please
Is the answer up above
How can i, oh how can i tell them
This is not a puppy love

This is not a puppy love
This is not a puppy love (not a puppy love)
This is not a puppy love
This is not a puppy love
