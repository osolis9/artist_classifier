Prophecy"(feat. Kelly Price
[Kelly Price]
Hmmm, hmmm
Ohhh, on and on and on

[Cam' Ron]
Yo, yo, yo, yo,
Yo, why stay here when all y'all don't play fair
Wanna disrespect slit cha neck, spit the tech (Ohhh)
Yellin' out baby hit da deck and all the people
See my face on all y'all TV's
Laid out like Castellano on a war with Thoebe (Ohhhh)
To my family y'all all the greedy
Yeah my mother, I can't judge her
I love her, but trust her, she a sucka (Ohhh)
Went D-Rugs when I turned around
Ready to lock her in the liquor store and burn it down
Or at least give her a tumor to kill the rumors (Yeahhh)
How she a coke consumer, and my girl too slick
Acting goody two shoes like she don't do spit (Ohhh)
I knew it, no bluffin, no fussin or nothin
After all, I'm the one that was up in her cousin (Hmmm)
But she got a girl in her world
F a boyfriend, I don't know if I'm mad or if I should join in
Like the movie flicks (Ohhh)
And all my trickers wit hoochie slit (Ohhh)
I tell 'em you be quick
My grandmother need her rubies fixed
And some Gucci chips
She think I'm paid cause she heard me with the Fugee clique (Ohhh)
All the money she want
I tell her sue me quick
Why don't you shoot me quick
Do it tasteful and gratefully, hateful
My grateful behalf (Hmmm)
Now my girl is crying pregnant
Look it and laugh (Ohhh)
No, and I ain't seen 'em last in a year and a half
But they hand open
Prepared for the cash (Yeahhh)
Ch'all don't offend me, my ends be
Buried out in the Indies, too bad I'm stingy (On and on)

[Chorus]
[Throughout chorus]

On and on away we'll fall (On)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (Sometimes, yeaahh)
On and on the pained ones say(On and on, ohhhhh)
How fragile we are, how fragile we are(We are sooo fragile)

[Cam' Ron]
Yo
Yo, yo (Yeaah)
Yo, you got a best friend, me too, mine's in heaven
My man Blood Deedee left in '97 (Ohhh)
C'mon how that sound, yo
Put my man in the ground, yo
Cause he let a girl be his downfall
We would slide together
In a ride together (Ohhhh)
What you know about Blood, even my endeavors
How we cried together, vowed to lie together
I wish I was in the whip, we could of died together (Ohhh)
Like the charm, love is gone, I ain't bleedin
But I got blood on my arm
Cause what happen when you die
You miss one or two treats
One or two weeks
One or two beeps
One or two peeps (Ohh)
Cats like you
Miss one or two freaks
Them hoes gon' cry
For one or two weeks (Yeahhh)
My life is like a car race
No brakes, just gas
Goin real fast
Probably land in a crash (Ohhh)
Like my cousin, perhaps, for a dozen and black
Harlem buzzin the fact, prayin I wasn't the cat (Yeahhh)
But haters lovin the fact, can't stay on my toes
And I be layin in low, y'all be blazin my hoes (Ohhhh)
Yeah, I sound wet
But lounge yet
Playa lay it down bet
Y'all be tryin to J and I ain't even in the ground yet (Hmmm)
And from the first I put my heart in it
I love you Blood Deedee (I love you)
I'll see you in a minute (Ohhh)

[Chorus]
[Throughout chorus]

On and on away we'll fall (Sometimes some fall)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (And the paain)
On and on the pained ones say (Sometimes it hurts so bad, ohhhh)
How fragile we are, how fragile we are (Ohhh, onnn)

On and on away we'll fall (Ohhhhh, yeahh)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (From a child, yeahhh)
On and on the pained ones say (On and on, yeahh)
How fragile we are, how fragile we are (oh yeahh)

On and on away we'll fall (We go on, on and on)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child (Sometimes we get lonely,
sometimes we get sad, but we go on)
On and on the pained ones say (Yeahhh)
How fragile we are, how fragile we are (We are soooo fragile, ohhhh)
