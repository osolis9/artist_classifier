Problem-Child:Russ
How did it go so wrong
This ain't the best you
You've been so wrong, since I met you
How did it get so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong, since I met you
You came into a fixed world, in a broken home
You lack guidence so you feelin' so alone
Cause out of the womb you had no room to excel
Feelin' like a demon seed so what's next?
Hell
Or better yet jail
And it's hard when its pre-determined that you shouldn't prevail
so you throw on some tupac
light up a pair of L's
crack a pair of bottles until you parasail
Away from the truth, straight toward the lies
Go on hang a noose on yo life 'till you die
That's what you doin'
How'd it go so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong, since I met you
How did it get so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong, since I met you
I tried to take you to a world that was different than yours
I opened opportunity you should've opened the door
And once I drew the line
I had you askin', who am I?
Yeah, I got the password
Y'all frontin' like this world ain't fucking backwards
These rappers need their daddies
Hoes need their daddies
That's why they mix and mingle and get along
But you can pass me with that bullshit
You're tryin' to fill this void inside a bottle
This void inside a blunt
This void inside a model
But you're daddy's what you want
But you're looking in the wrong place
You're analyzing lies
So you all looking in the wrong face
And y'all do it all the time
What I'm tryin' to say
How did it go so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong, since I met you
How did it get so wrong
This ain't the best you
It's been so wrong, since I met you
Y'all need to look within
Y'all need to look within
