Heels-On:Slim
See I ain't never met another shorty
Especially from the way you put it on me
Lookin' good in Manolo Blahniks
6 heel pumps, you can tell that she got it
Wait a minute

Girl stop, wait a minute
Take off your pants, take off your shirt
Take off your bra, take off your thongs
Girl, it's your birthday, leave your heels on

Can we do it with your heels on?
Let me see you with your heels on
Can we do it with your heels on?
Give it to you with your heels on, baby

She in them heels, I'm in between
She want the business, I make her scream
I make her cream, she in love with a youngin'
That's 'cause I turn her fountain on
And keep that water runnin'

She said she got a man but she let her feelin's in
Legs so high her Giuseppes hit the ceilin' fan
Okay 'cause I'm what you want, I know what you need
Me in your life, you're my penthouse suite

Ya, ya, on the balcony, give it to you, baby, just like a G
You ain't never made love in club, baby
To a thug like yeah, Young YB
She take her bra off, I felt my grill on
Take off them boy shorts and leave your heels on

Girl stop, wait a minute
Take off your pants, take off your shirt
Take off your bra, take off your thongs
Girl, it's your birthday, leave your heels on

Can we do it with your heels on?
Let me see you with your heels on
Can we do it with your heels on?
Give it to you with your heels on, baby

Put on whatever type of heels you like
But I like the ones that make you wanna get right
We could take it fast, we could take it slow
Either way it goes, your heels steal the show

'Cause you got it like that, Gucci, Louis, Prada
It's a true fact that I want you in all of 'em
Them keep 'em on in the air, switch 'em up, go again
We can try all tonight

Because I want know if I can get it
Say you want it all, let me show the pretty, get it
I can do it good, treat you real nice
Especially with them heels on to set it off right, baby

Girl stop, wait a minute
Take off your pants, take off your shirt
Take off your bra, take off your thongs
Girl, it's your birthday, leave your heels on

Can we do it with your heels on?
Let me see you with your heels on
Can we do it with your heels on?
Give it to you with your heels on, baby

I wanna give it to you with your heels on now
Make me wanna weigh you up and give it to you by the pound
Caliente songs on tha hot tamale
Your pants, your bra, your shirt, we gon' take it off your body

Now it feel like it's your birthday but I'ma smack that ass
Blow them candles out, you wishin' I'ma be able to last
Girl, stop playin', I was built ram tough
See, we don't need handcuffs, let's get our bodies jam up

Hey, take a sip of this, take a puff of that
That was free punch and this is cush up in my sack
Your posture in them heels, the one that ties around your legs
That's the right attire when I'm puttin' you to bed

Girl stop, wait a minute
Take off your pants, take off your shirt
Take off your bra, take off your thongs
Girl, it's your birthday, leave your heels on

Can we do it with your heels on?
Let me see you with your heels on
Can we do it with your heels on?
Give it to you with your heels on, baby

Whatever type of heels you like but
We could take it fast, we could take it slow
Either way it goes, your heels are the show

Put on whatever type of heels you like
I like ones that wan' make you get right
We could take it fast, we could take it slow
Either way it goes, your heels steal the show
