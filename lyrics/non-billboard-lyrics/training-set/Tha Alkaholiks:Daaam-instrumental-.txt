Alkaholiks got the freaks that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
Alkaholiks got the freestyle that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
Alkaholiks got the rhymes that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
Everytime I make a jam, make you wanna say, "Daaam!"

E-Swift, test the rocket launcher, let's blow up the spot
Show 'em what we got for the ninety-flow shot
I'm the brown bomber droppin' verbal scuds
I write rhymes while my momma peel the skin off the spuds
This ain't baseball, naw, the Liks won't slump
So make room for the crew with beats the jump

Yo, I'm the baddest man with a hit since Willie Mays
I'm playin' for the A's, O.G. was right 'cause rhyme pays
I walk through a rainstorm, I didn't even get wet
I was bailing through Hell, I didn't even bust a sweat

So you must have a locomotive, I mean a crazy reason
To wanna step up, it's sucker punk season
Bring it on young one, so you can get done
I got mo' styles than the miles to the sun
Ninety-three million, five thousand flows
And here's one more for the hoes

Alkaholiks got the freestyle that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
The Alkaholiks got the freaks that'll make you say, "Daaam!"

Geyeah, Alkaholiks for ninety-fo'
Makin' more dutch than Ross Perot
Check it out, yeah
Like that, Xzibit all in your grill
Hah, that's that nigga Xzibit, yeah
'Cause in ninety-four it's all about the flows
The hoes and the forty-o's, nigga!

Kick your, dopest rhyme I'll break it up like 3rd Bass
I'm from the crew that sets it off by sprayin' beer in your face
So the ninety-four to them for my niggaz that remember
Means I'm steppin' to the mic with lyrics colder than December
The liquidator with the hardcore demanor's
Bustin' out the perpetrators, I see through 'em like a Zima
So I'm never caught between a hard place and a rock
'Cause I kill rhyme bandits bare handed like Mr. Spock

I told chief not to start no beef
He tried to shoot me with his gun, I caught the bullet with my teeth
'Cause I'm stronger than the bull that's on the Schlitz Malt Liquor
Hittin' up your cities with the Alkaholik sticker
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose
It's the wicked pain inflictor with the Mickey's deuce deuce

Droppin' rhymes like a boulder on the twenty-one and older
That's what your momma with my picture tattooed on her shoulder
So rap artists, "Get ready to rumble!"
'Cause I got lyrics up my sleeve that slam harder than Mutumbo
I heard your demo tape that shit was faker than a scam
While I be droppin' shit that make you say

The Alkaholiks got the beats that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
The Alkaholiks got the freaks that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
The Alkaholiks got the flows that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
The Alkaholiks got the hoes that'll make you say, "Daaam!"

The Alkaholiks got the flows that'll make you say, "Daaam!"
The Alkaholiks got the hoes that'll make you say, "Daaam!"

I've been told that my style is so cold it make your nose run and J
I make the ladies say, "Make money, money!"
I used to have a curl but I cut my shit real low
'Cause every weekend I had a spin on the pillow
Watts, Willabrooke, even shook, when I took
A fresh-ass hook out my notebook

Dan na dah, dan na dah, I love sports
I even watch soccer and the girls on the tennis courts
You try to tackle me, you couldn't make me fall
'Cause I been movin' ahead since the day I learned to crawl
Y'all, aww shit, let me make a wish
I wish all the punk MC's turn to fish

So I could just hook 'em, take 'em home and cook 'em
That's how I floss, yo pass the hot sauce
When I walk down the streets I leave my feetprints in the concrete
'Cause I'm fat, meaning, I'm so complete
Like a freak on an elevator, I'ma fuck you up
It's the Ro with the inebiriated flow
I hate to boast but I'm the host with most
And I'm ghost, here's a toast to my people's from coast to coast

It's like that
It's like this uh, it's like that
It's like this uh, it's like that
Well it's like this uh, it's like that
Like that, word up, Alkaholiks
X to the Z Xzibit
In the motherfuckin place, yeah
Let me shout it out once, once, once

To my nigga King Tee, you don't stop
To my nigga Diamond D, you don't stop
To my nigga DJ Pooh, you don't stop
To my nigga J-Ro, you don't stop

To that nigga E-Swift, you don't stop
To that nigga D Pimp, you don't stop
To my nigga all across the board
This is how it go and I won't leave you, sore

Uh, the freestyle flow dicks
Rico's in the house and I'm from the fuckin' Liks
Don't perpetrate or you get perpetrated
Rico's in the house, yes, yes, my niggaz made the whole set up
Your whole damn crew will get wet up
Nineteeen ninety-four in the house we won't let up
Yes, the freestyle flow on and on
