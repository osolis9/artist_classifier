Bankroll Mob
Okay okay
You know, you know
Well I be
Bumping California Love on the West Side
Thanking God for the weed, women, and the sunshine
Dumb hot
Out on Sunset
Blowing kush
From the one time
You get a contact
Catch ya ass at the red light
Wanna run at 'em sideways in a Hellcat
On some run flat
By the way I
Never seen a better view, not in Malibu
Bunch of bad bitches naked in the swimming pool
Hear the waves crashing, playing spades in the living room (Cracking)
Sound like a Doggystyle interlude
Kurupt Gotti, nigga where the gas at?
Moon rock got me acting like I never had shit
From Bankhead to a Hollywood address
Same nigga tho
Wanna run get your ass kicked
Respect it more than a tad bit
Every hood every set though
