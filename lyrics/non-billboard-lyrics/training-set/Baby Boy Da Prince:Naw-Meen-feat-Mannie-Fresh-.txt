[Intro:]
Say fresh we goin back home on this one right here ya heard me
See the ladies was buckin from left to right
And the dudes was thuggin from side to side
It was a bum, bum bum, bum, bum bum snap
And a ickeh ickeh fresh and i added a clap

And get the party jumpin for the rest of the night

[Chorus:]
Homie I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
My wrist on bling with a fresh Soly
3 Hundred dolla jeans with a grill on bean
With a bundle in my jeans and its real homie
Naw meen ay ay naw meen [x4]

[Verse 1:]
I step up in the club lookin freshin than them other
Ice so bright make ya eyes stevie wonder
Way down under at the bottom of the boot
I just gotta keep it real I just gotta speak

If you less than 500 ima boss on you bitchez
Hustle hustle real hard rick ross on you bitchez
If ya carrots aint high I dont wanna see ya jewelry
Cuz my shit shinny and ya'll be all blurry

Cuz I's so fresh and I's so clean

[Chorus]
Homie I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
My wrist on bling with a fresh Soly
3 Hundred dolla jeans with a grill on bean
With a bundle in my jeans and its real homie
Naw meen ay ay naw meen [x4]

[Verse 3:]
Walkin everywhere dustin off myself

And I know you niggaz hear I do my thang on you

Homie I'm so fresh and I'm so clean
My wrist on bling with a fresh Soly
3 Hundred dolla jeans with a grill on bean
With a bundle in my jeans and its real homie
Naw meen ay ay naw meen [x4]
