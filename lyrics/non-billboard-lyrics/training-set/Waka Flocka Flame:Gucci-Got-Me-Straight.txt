Ft: Lex Luger & Tay Beatz

I got so many options, Flocka like poppin
I'll bag your bitch today, and take her best friend shoppin'
Take her mother shoppin', take her brother shoppin'
Gucci got me super straight, and shawty I got that super cake

I'll bang your bitch today, and take her best friend shoppin'
Take her mother shoppin', take her brother shoppin'
Gucci got me super straight, and shotty I got that super cake

Signed to 1017 Warner Brother records
I can buy burger king, mcDonalds or Checkers
Drugs like Eckerds, cheap like sketchers
An got more hoes then Hugh Hefner
Hey shotty I got options!

In the club bottle poppin, marijuana loud
An' the crown goin' wild and I think they like my style
Rockstar shotty, I might jump off in the crowd
Bobble head Waka, Dreads goin wild
Shotty super thick, but her friend stupid fine
Thinkin' to myself, like "dez hoes gotta be mine"
Tryin' to entwine, dick up in they spine
Flocka bossed up, fuck liquor, drinkin' wine

I got so many options, Flocka like poppin

Take her mother shoppin', take her brother shoppin'
Gucci got me super straight, and shotty I got that super cake
