Like-It-or-Love-It:Kreayshawn
ft Kid Cudi 

I got strawberry letter 27 
I got gold bananas engraved 
With my grandmothers title signature 
What you got? 

I got me a bunch of haters, 
Got me a bunch of faders 
Be like sayonara see ya laterrr 
Jordan's on with the 808 drum 
And you bitches can’t get none, I'm just so done 
Don't say shit though, say you know? No one know you 
I'm in your city like a mayor hoe, I lead by example 
your hoe lives by dismantle 
Don't tell a soul what we did just keep it stable 
I'm dope, you're on dope 
Get it? 
Run and get the phone and you can't call for better 
I was on the phone tellin' bitches that I'm wetter 
I killed it once, I killed it twice and no I don't regret it 

Chorus: 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
Do just what you do 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
Do just what you do Alright 

Lookin to trip, not really just lookin' for clues 
I’m so important that one of my shoes is news 
Custom perches might make bitches take off their shoes 
How could I not, if I didn't then I wouldn't be scott 
Broken hearted it slowly rots, I hope she knows that hardees sucks 
I'm goin back up, don’t summon me again unless your ready for the pain 
You better step up, when you see me in the box, believe ib ball mayne 
Mags on mags on mags I don't have to push motherfucker who's bad 
Don't give a fuck about much, I'm cool and calm just like my dad 
Niggas wanna live like us, niggas wanna floss like us 
Fuck a bitch good like us, cool the cartier like us 
Cruise all night with me, niggas really in Paris 

Chorus: 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
Do just what you do 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
What u doin'? Do just what you do 
You like it and then you love it Alright 
Do just what you do Alright 

I be on that power 
Maybe on that powder 
All these bitches yeah they my bastards 
They my bastards 
They my bastards 
Tell Ron Hubbard 50, I'm like WTF!! 
Outside raining kitties, my doctor knows what's up! 
I be provin' last dance, I'm the only one 
in hate sky high shinin' demon like the fuckin' sun 
Throw my shades now I'm off on a world tour 
Get less but a mind wanna give more 
Boom boom for my girls on the dance floor 
Pour some for the people, they work hard 
Closer than her body, she's throwin a big party 
She's inviting Cudi, we beat it ’til its bloody 

[Chorus:]
