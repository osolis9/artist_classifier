Life-Could-Be-Swell:Self
What's the use in singing songs
We can all chime in off key
We can dance until we all fall down
What's the use of a pretty face
One that's painted and ignores
Every earthling that violates her space (space)

Why not go out and wrestle the tide?
Why not question the very truth 
By which we abide?
Seems it all comes to pass so quickly
Why take shit from those who don't care?
The only true reason their really there
And have a job
Cause their label's the mob

Now me I'm not one to dwell
On the ups and downs or in my own hell
I just sit back and think
About how life can be swell

Sometimes it never as fun
As some may make it seem
I slip my fingers in between
The shoulders of all the people
Sometimes it's never as easy
As the child inside thought it would be
Professional community
Run by thieves

Now me I'm not one to dwell
On the ups and downs or in my own hell
I just sit back and think
About how life can be swell

Me I'm not one to dwell
On the good, the bad, or in my own hell
I just back and think 
About how life can be swell

Life could be swell

I wanna sing R&B;
Make a million dollar video for BET
Do a remix version for MTV
Get shot, come back to life in 5 movies

Life could be swell
