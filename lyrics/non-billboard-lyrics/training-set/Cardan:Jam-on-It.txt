Jam-on-It:Cardan
[cardan]
See(uh-huh)
Cuda love will make ya bounce to this
L-a make ya bounce to this
Everybody we gonna bounce to this
We gon' rock this

Yo, yo it's a harlem world thang
So grab something
Asks for dimes and up, if not have something
But come shake them hips like waiters take them tips
And bring half of the world i got plenty of space to fit
Except for me i makes your boogie
Boogie to the beat
Once beat bang boogie, i got a party in the street
No bacardi with heat, but a party full of peace
Jammin til' i feel it in the bottom of my feet
Now dance if you gotta
Shake ya pants if you gotta
Scream cardan out in france if you gotta
Shake with me, motivate, sweatigate, feel straight
Wake up in the morning at eight
I tell my baby girl its a world who came here to party
Tell her friend and ima tell me and we gonna start it
J-d know all of our hoes come to our doors
And the dance-floor gets to jam some more

[chorus by cardan]
Jam on it, jam on it
If you got what it takes just flaunt it
All my ladies in the house you want it
And all my fellas in the house get on it
2x

[jermaine dupri]
Never see me in a watch without the rocks and the bezel
And the band on the level, niggas cant understand
I'm the one you watch in the club all all night
On the top hoes love and call all night
Its' the c-h-i-chio yo
With the drop with the pedal to the floor
Hoes come to me and get dressed, what they lookin fo?
Lookin' fly and ima die gettin mo dough
Niggas know i dont talk, i show in flash
And dont exagerate cash in my heavyweight class
Get the ass ya'll dream about
Hear niggas sing about
I ain't never seen without
Got the dance floors packed and burnin' up
Puttin cats on the back as i turn it up
Now tell me what yall wanna do?
Get down and then ran through
Thats how this little man do

[chorus] 2x

[cardan]
Nown, now, now for my ladies keep dancin, fellas keep boppin
Shake what your mama gave and it dont stop with it
Move it side to side it with it, rock with it
So much space you fit the whole block in it
So get on down, get on down
Now harlem world it's on now, it's on now
Jam with me til you feel it in yo middle back bone
If you fifteen to fifty you aint gotta act grown
One thing you got to give em(ass)
A little bit of rhytmn
Make em move from side to side then spin em(no lies)
I get em from the side or the middle
As long as i can turn sunshine into a drizzle
Cardan, so when i close
I say amen to the god that brought me here
Made the world so fear
Oh yeah, i'm bout to rock for this whole year
In this big city of rap, unless its joe clear

[chorus]
