Crash-Landing:Offset & Metro Boomin
It seems our Time has all run out
Were falling from tonight's sky
Trying to block this whole world out,eyelids closing

I've always dreamed of dying in my sleep
Eternities of counting sheep
But I... I know better now

The view from here is not worth the fall
I'm sick of landing on my head (with you)

My heart tonight
The city burns so bright
From this altitude that we cruise

Were weightless
Were fateless or so we thought
Cause what goes up now must come down


Straight Down Down Down
The Flashing Lights
Looking like a runway here tonight
Prepare for crash landing
Prepare for crash landing

In the cold concrete, in my warm bed
A thousand tons of falling lead
Prepare for crash landing
Prepare for crash landing

Lets board this flight
I'm sick of life right now
And it's time to say goodbye

Where to? Is far too dark to tell
Maybe heaven, Probably hell
There's one thing that i know
And it's what goes up now must come down

Straight Down Down Down
The Flashing Lights
Looking like a runway here tonight
Prepare for crash landing
Prepare for crash landing

In the cold concrete, in my warm bed
A thousand tons of falling lead
Prepare for crash landing
Prepare for crash landing

I can't wake up
I can't wake up
I'm giving up

What goes up now must come down
And what goes up now must
What goes now up must come down


Straight Down Down Down
The Flashing Lights
Looking like a runway here tonight
Prepare for crash landing
Prepare for crash landing

In the cold concrete, in my warm bed
A thousand tons of falling lead
Prepare for crash landing
Prepare for crash landing

Prepare for crash landing
Prepare for crash landing
