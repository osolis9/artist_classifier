We-ll-Be-Alright-amended-album-version-:Travie McCoy
We are young, we run free
State of lay, we don't sleep,
Got our friends, got the night,
We'll be alright

Tonight you won't be by yourself-self
Just leave your problems on the shelf-shelf
You won't wanna be nowhere else-else
So let's go, so let's go

We got the club life (whoooooo)
And all the girls saying (whoooooo)
The hole world saying (whoooooo)
Yeah yeah c'mon let's get your toasted up
We don't give a fuck

We are young, we run free
State of lay, we don't sleep,
Got our friends, got the night, we'll be alright
Throw our hands in the air, pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night, we'll be alright

(whoooooo) Alright alright alright
(whoooooo) Ah ah ah ah
(whoooooo) Alright alright alright
(whoooooo) Ah ah ah ah

We walk the streets like we don't care-care
Our little fingers in the air-air
So, come and join us we'll be there-there
Yeah, let's go, yeah let's go

We got the club life (whoooooo)
And all the girls saying (whoooooo)
The hole world saying (whoooooo)
Yeah yeah c'mon let's get your toasted up
We don't give a fuck

We are young, we run free
State of lay, we don't sleep,
Got our friends, got the night, we'll be alright
Throw our hands in the air, pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night, we'll be alright

Feels like aaaaaaa
(Yeah, feels good don't it)
Aaaaaa (do-do-don't it)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll be alright
(repeat)
uh huh!

We are young, we run free
State of lay, we don't sleep,
Got our friends, got the night, we'll be alright
Throw our hands in the air, pretty girls everywhere
Got our friends, got the night, we'll be alright
