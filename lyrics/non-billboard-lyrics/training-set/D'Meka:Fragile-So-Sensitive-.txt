Fragile-So-Sensitive-:D'Meka
You're so fragile
You are so, you are hard to handle
You're so fragile
You are so fragile, boy
You're so fragile
You are so, so, like a baby in a cradle
You're so fragile
I ain't no, I ain't got no love for you
You hold on so tight
Cause you fear I might run away from you
Won't you trust yourself
And know that there's no one else to do me like you do
And when not go out with the girls
I must justify me around
Everywhere I go
I know you say that I'm your world
But the way it's goin' down
But I gotta let you go
I'm so fragile
Gotta loosen those chains from me
You're so fragile
Boy, can't you let me be
You're so fragile
I can't take the load you give me
You're so fragile
I'm better off when you're not with me
I wish that someday I could make you feel
The love that's in my heart it's so, oh for real
I know that there's a little sensativity
That sometimes gets out of my hand
But that's a part of the growth process
I'm just tryin' to be a man
Here's the way that you thrill me
Oh, I know you feel me baby
It's the way that you sit in a chair
Oh, I'm not goin' anywhere
It's the way that you lay in the bed
Keepin' the spread all around me
It's everything you do
And I just can't keep my hands off of you baby
You're so fragile
Gotta loosen that chains from me
You're so fragile
Boy, can't you let me be
You're so fragile
I can't take the load you give me
You're so fragile
I'm better off when you're not with me
When we first fell in love
We made vows to keep it real
Put a seat up, let me tell you how I feel
It seems like every move I make
Every step I take
Puts your right in that position where it breaks
Never did I know
What was the love with a person
The whole day they're feelin' sad
And don't bill if they hurtin'
But still you keep your composure
Still you speak with dignity
Let me give you some tips
And baby maybe you can keep me for one
If we in love, let love take his place
I wanna think about you sometime
Without seein' a sad face
It's cool to be around, but not every second
I never peep but I get peeps
Cos' you're constantly checkin' for two
A very strong word called trust
I will never let another man come between us
And last on the list, you want me to keep it tight
Stop actin' fragile, or I need a dog in my life
You're so fragile
You are so, you are hard to handle
You're so fragile
You are so fragile, boy
You're so fragile
You are so, so, like a baby in a cradle
You're so fragile
I ain't no, I ain't got no love for you
You're so fragile
Gotta loosen those chains from me
You're so fragile
Boy, can't you let me be
You're so fragile
I can't take the load you give me
You're so fragile
I'm better off when you're not with me
