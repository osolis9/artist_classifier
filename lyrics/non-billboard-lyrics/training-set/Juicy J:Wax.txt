Wax:Juicy J
Let's get high, let's get stoned
Take a hit of this and you won't make it home
Take another hit, now I'm in my zone
I can't remember shit, these drugs got me gone

I come up with a hit and put it on wax
My homie high as shit, I put him on wax
It's goin' down like candle wax
Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
Wax, wax, put him on wax
Wax, wax, put him on wax
Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
Wax, wax, put him on wax

Wasted like a white boy, you know I got the best grass
Chillin' with my snow bunny, kick back, blowing hash
Two, three hits put you on your ass
Weed look like it got a diaper rash
Loud pack in a plastic bag, smoke out in a gas mask
Hippie bitch made an apple bong, good weed, alcohol
We party like we college kids, got more money than a powerball
Bitch, I live that fast life every day in ten speed
Look up in the sky, is that a plane? No, it's just me

I come up with a hit and put it on wax
My homie high as shit, I put him on wax
It's goin' down like candle wax
Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
Wax, wax, put him on wax
Wax, wax, put him on wax
Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
Wax, wax, put him on wax

Hey bitch, what that ass like? Blow me like a bag pipe
Trippy shit get high as fuck, I be on them bag pipes
Plus I got my cash right, shining on them like a flashlight
In the projects with a ratchet bitch, her house look like a crash sight
Shorty pussy so wet, waterfall, TLC
That wax got me turnt up, that shit just the THC
Fire, getting paid, fire, getting blazed
In that new Bentley truck and I'm whipping it like a runaway slave

I come up with a hit and put it on wax
My homie high as shit, I put him on wax
It's goin' down like candle wax
Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
Wax, wax, put him on wax
Wax, wax, put him on wax
Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
Wax, wax, put him on wax

Let's get high, let's get stoned
Take a hit of this and you won't make it home
Take another hit, now I'm in my zone
I can't remember shit, these drugs got me gone
