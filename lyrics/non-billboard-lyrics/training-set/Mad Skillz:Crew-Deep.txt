Crew-Deep:Mad Skillz
I be the S-K-I, double L, Z'n
Block is hot again, guess who's the reason?
Your favorite rapper, I got his ass not breathin'
You seen me with Missy so it's VA season

Like
(Holla)
Check the flow
And if you a hater, exit the door
Rap is a set-up, just a lot of games
A lot of suckas with colorful names

I'm so and so, I'm this, I'm that
But all y'all cats rap about is cars and crack
And these R&B; cats, spammers, what you think?
You sound better with a wife-beater and a bandanna?

(Hey)
You fools need to stop
Half y'all got paid studying pop
And as far as these beats, I spit sparks to them
I'm sick in the booth, ayo, shorty, talk to 'em, like

Y'all don't really wanna fuck with me
My clique D double E to the P
(Ah)
I put two in ya side
Flow in ya door in ya motherfucking ride

Y'all really wanna fuck with me?
My clique D double E to the P
(Ah)
I put two in ya chest
Ain't no other yet 'cause I'm the motherfucking best

Yo, stop what you're doin' 'cause I'm about to ruin
These half-ass rappers you're used to
So who the fuck wanna battle me?
I spit slugs out my mouth 'bout the size of a C battery

Like, chik, chik, chik, put it down, man
Half of y'all cats lying on your sound scan
And you sold what? That was the amount?
Come on nigga, you know sample tapes don't count

Real quick out the stash, been flippin' at dash
Bruise me with two feet when I'm kicking yo' ass
And you never catch me in the club leaving a skirt
If I don't get brains then the meter get jerk

Y'all them fools in the club with a Smedian shirt
Rent a car in your hometown just to see if it work
For 18 years, your momma been feedin' a jerk
I spit something hot, have you getting Weezy like Turk, nigga

Y'all don't really wanna fuck with me
My clique D double E to the P
(Ah)
I put two in ya side
Flow in ya door in ya motherfucking ride

Y'all really wanna fuck with me?
My clique D double E to the P
(Ah)
I put two in ya chest
Ain't no other yet 'cause I'm the motherfucking best

Ayo, say blast I'ma blast while y'all play dummies
Thinking I ain't gon' get this money
Watch me come through, spit sick, and get fly
Beat you on your best day on your best try and
(Y'all don't really wanna)

Dig out the stash 'cause I probably on yo' ass
And my words make the track get up
While I move on it, groove on it
And keep you flows on the cut like

Rockin' mics, y'all know how we get down
Catch me on tour when I slide through your town
I'm hit bound, y'all lay down flat
The new 'King of VA', who's fuckin' with that?

Y'all don't really wanna fuck with me
My clique D double E to the P
(Ah)
I put two in ya side
Flow in ya door in ya motherfucking ride

Y'all really wanna fuck with me?
My clique D double E to the P
(Ah)
I put two in ya chest
Ain't no other yet 'cause I'm the motherfucking best
