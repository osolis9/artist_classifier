Thinking-the-Same-Thing:Pretty Willie
I, I know what you're thinkin about
You, you probably wanna go out
So, so go on and do what you do
Im thinkin the same thing
Im thinkin the same thing too

I, I know what you're thinkin about
You, you probably wanna go out
So, so go on and do what you do
Im thinkin the same thing, Im thinkin the same thing

Came in on the late night, somethin just aint right
Cuz what do I see, my girls gettin dressed up
And she got me messed up cuz shes stayin home with me
She say her and her friends goin out, bout to hit the club
She pulled up, she was on her way
I kissed her on the cheek so sweet, boo I love you have a nice day
Its a shame what a man might do when his girl is gone
First thing that we do is immediatly pick up the phone

Call up my partners (partners), see whats poppin (poppin)
I just went shoppin (shoppin), so it aint no stoppin 
Cuz Ima playa (playa), what can I saya (saya)
Ima hit the streets with matchin suits and gators

I, I know what you're thinkin about
You, you probably wanna go out
So, so go on and do what you do
Im thinkin the same thing too

I, I know what you're thinkin about
You, you probably wanna go out
So, so go on and do what you do
Im thinkin the same thing, Im thinkin the same thing

So now I finally got my clothes on, plus I got my? on
Haters cant stop my style
And you know I ride that hummer thang, suella dont maintane
Lookin for that girl of mine
Pull up in VIP see whats poppin (poppin)
And you know aint no stoppin till the panties droppin
You know Im with the front line, 
It aint no stoppin

Its a shame what a man might do when his girl is gone
First thing that we do is immediatly pick up the phone

The bar is free (free), because of me (me)
I aint got no problem lettin the club drink on me
Cuz Ima playa (playa), what can I saya (saya)
Ima hit the street with matchin suits and gator

I, I know what you're thinkin about

What you expect, look at you all dressed up
Im thinkin like you, do what you do, handle your biz
But when I do what I do, you know how it is
911, no emergencys, just bottles of cris, friends, currency.
You know how we are, front line, so go on and do what you do
Do yours, Ima do mine

I, I know what you're thinkin about
You, you probably wanna go out
So, so go on and do what you do
Im thinkin the same thing too

I, I know what you're thinkin about
