Looking-For-Love:Diddy - Dirty Money
She says she's looking for love
You know we have to do it again, right?
All the girls in the club know, wussup
She said she undercover though and this is what she want

She's got me higher in this motherfucker
She's got me flying in this motherfucker
Ready to die up in this motherfucker
Got damn, she badder than a motherfucker

Let's make a movie, two superstars
To big body coupes, avatars
The marriage niggaz stay and they e-condo large
I stay in Louis Bedspreads camouflage, let's go

She wants the finer things and all that she can get from me
She even wants the lovely cutie on my arm
She get it in all way turned up, she a rider
She says she's in the mood for love

She says she's looking for love
You know we have to do it again, right?
All the girls in the club know, wussup
She said she undercover though and this is what she want

Watch out that girl is trouble
They ain't got nothing on her
Can't even fight her hunger
She a get it girl, watch her do her thang

What she's got she got from her mother?
She super straight body shaped like no other
She's making her way to my area
And when she gets past security

I say, "Hello, welcome to my table
Bring your girlfriends, everything's paid for
We gon get it in, ain't that what you came for?
Heard you was looking for me

She say, she looking for love
And all the girls in the club know, wussup
She says she under cover though
And this is what she wants

Straight off the Concorde, to cheers and encore
Nice sweats, she phenes for one boy
The innovator, young Sean Combs
Reminiscing me and biggie bringing boys home

Father figure, hating for them other niggaz
Dirty money went and brought a money printer
Now my money longer on the Mississippi river
Money making extraordinary, I am the nigga

She says she's looking for love
You know we have to do it again, right?
All the girls in the club know, wussup
She said she undercover though and this is what she want

Yo Usher, talk to her
I, I know just what you liked
I, I wanna make you feel good inside
Girl, if you just give me a little bit

I know you gon' love it
I, I know you wanna try
I, I'm the only thing on her mind
Tonight she's mine, oh mine

"Hello, welcome to my table
Bring your girlfriends, everything's paid for
We gon' get it in, ain't that what you came for?
Heard you was looking for me"

She say, she looking for love
And all the girls in the club know, wussup
She says she under cover though
And this is what she wants
