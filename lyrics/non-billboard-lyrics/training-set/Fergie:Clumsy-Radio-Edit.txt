The first time, that I saw your eyes
Boy you looked right through me, umm ummm
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mm mmm

You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh), flippin' (oh), fumblin' (oh)
Clumsy 'cuz I'm fallin' in love (in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh), sinkin' (oh), crumblin' (oh)
Clumsy 'cuz I'm fallin' in love (in love)
So in love with you

She can´t help it. The girl can't help it (Oh baby)

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This love sick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh...
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me...
And I'm back

She can´t help it. The girl can't help it (In love)
She can´t help it. The girl can't help it (Oh God)
