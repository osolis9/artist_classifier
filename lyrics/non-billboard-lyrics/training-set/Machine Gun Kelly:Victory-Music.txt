Victory-Music:Machine Gun Kelly
This is a real rappers theme music
Bitch sing to it
This how you cook up some dope with no powder
Don't turn on that stove just turn this shit up louder

Black Eddie Bauer
Mask on my face like I'm ready to take what is yours cause it's ours
Y'all stole my style I shit on you like bowels
And take all your princesses bitch I am Bowser
Fuck super powers I got this weed
Gun on my hip now that's all that I need
I don't play games man I'm not in no league
And I don't drop no names but bitch I am from Cle-veland
Damn someone tell Britney we did it again
I hear Pooh Gutta acquitted again
And my bank account holding 6 digits again
Pour up some Henn
This for the ones who ain't make it
This for the ones who ain't make it
Focus your lens point it at me and see greatness
Point it at me and see greatness
Ray need a Benz
Dub needa all black Mercedes
Tezo need all white he racist
But homie I'm Sayin
I need a penthouse that's vacant
A-rab money "Salaam-Alaikum"
The beast is awaken pick up your shotty
My bitch is a murderer she got a body
She got that brain summa cum laude
My city the jungle don't take that safari
It's lions it's tigers
Gangsters disciples

Sail
Up out of the ghetto away from the mornings where snow in that shovel
Sail
Up out of this level I'm tryna be number one why would I settle
Sail
Gone to the
New world no Pinta no nina no Santa Maria
Still keep it hood with my pia sippin Carlos Rossi sangria

Uh
Drank in my cup
Working my wrist I be spankin my slut
Juggle my nuts use your two hands while I juggle these fucks
But thats zero it's none
My hands busy holding middle fingers up
I don't two things that's love and it's trust
And I don't hate y'all I'm just fuckin with us
And thats word to Nipsey my hustles mean I can sell bats to Ken Griffey
I'm like Lionel Richie
My fans got me touring till 2050
The cycle is evil
These verses for Tino
On top of my people
And fuck all these fakers can't wait till you back on your feet the streets need you.

Sail
Up out of the ghetto away from the mornings where snow in that shovel
Sail
Up out of this level I'm tryna be number one why would I settle
Sail
Gone to the
New world no Pinta no nina no Santa Maria
Still keep it hood with my pia sippin Carlos Rossi sangria
