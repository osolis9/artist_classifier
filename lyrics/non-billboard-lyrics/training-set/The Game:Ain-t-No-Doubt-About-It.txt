Ain-t-No-Doubt-About-It:The Game
[**feat. Justin Timberlake & Pharrell Williams**]


[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
 I just wanna touch ya girl, the way you move
 Oh, you make me love you girl, cause lady you cool
 That's the way, you can move it baby
 Tell your girls, to come join our table
 Don't you worry, just keep movin boo
 Cause you're the star, everybody looking at you
 Ain't no doubt about it girl, the way you move
 Ain't no doubt about it, hey girl, baby you cool

[Verse 1: Game]
 G-A-M-E, drop top Bent-a-ley
 Gucci belt buckle fresh out of Italy
 I'm a baller, literally
 Haters are swine flu, you're killing me
 I'm looking down on you from where the ceiling be
 Me and my niggas swarm on you like the killer bees
 My chick riding shotgun, Billie Jean
 Half Belizian, half from the Phillipines
 Niggas energy, is like they got the heaves
 Sick of me think they wanna nine milly me
 But they ain't for rat tat tat-tat tat
 My bullets sing like their registered to ASCAP
 Need I say more out in Singapore
 Everything I do exotic I don't need to bring a broad
 Mr. Red Carpet, I don't do awards
 You want it I done it five million on tour, offshore

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
 Ayo Pharrell, I'm ri-ri-diculous, so-so sick with it
 You can call me cancer but I don't smoke cigarettes
 Come through in a 'rari same color as licorice
 If I ain't with her my bitch like "this my nigga's shit"
 Haters beware, I can see clear
 Through the lens on these black Louis V's yeah
 Something 'bout Mary, make me wanna blow up
 And P got the 'disiac for me when I show up
 Whip game crazy I call it all kinda
 You a big fish to swim the piranhas
 Used to call me "Dope Game" when I Jose
 Now I play the Roosevelt and I cop Rose
 (Niggas be like yo you lease that? No way)
 California Slim license plate St. Tropez
 Eat at a table full of toupees, lobsters
 Been a mobster since the two-way holla

[Hook]
