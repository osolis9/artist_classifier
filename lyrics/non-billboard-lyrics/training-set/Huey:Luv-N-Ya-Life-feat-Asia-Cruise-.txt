Mommy, I could be the thug in your love
Play my part with the fifty fifty love in our life
By the way I'm Huey, I know how to treat a women
Never raised my hand, don't know how to beat a women

Won't touch until you're comfortable
Even though I'm want'n you

By the looks of things, girl, it seems you want me to
Take you on a ride and the five fifty a.m.g a

Yeah, I'm makin' money an' no that money ain't makin' me
Know that I wouldn't hurt you

I want you to feel safe with me
Baby girl, ya beautiful, you're like a model
Not the skin, you in ya curve like a bottle

Now when we hit this thang, you automatically look good
Off of my appearance I automatically look good
Make my way to ya door, open it they like a gentlemen
Take you by the arm, a Kodak flashes while entering

Take you to the bar, buy ya your favorite drink or two
And all ain't gettin' it, so I can try to sleep with you
What person in their right mind wouldn't wanna be with you
You da type I take home and show to my peoples boo

I ain't gonna lie, I hate women who sensitive for real
Be lettin' the littlest things get to them
Lil' mamma listen, I'm able to be the thug in your life
Most of all I gotta be able to put
