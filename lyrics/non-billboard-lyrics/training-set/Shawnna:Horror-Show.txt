Killin’ all these motherfuckers, welcome to my horror show
You can tell ‘er cuz this sniper riffle got them horror scopes
Flyer than these rappers, man I think I need one parachute
Sicker than these rappers, man I think I need some Theraflu
Clownin’ all you niggas, man they put me in the circus
In my own class, bitch don’t mix me with no Urkle’s
Ale streets nigga and I murder with no conscience
If you ain’t talkin’ ‘bout money then that shit is nonsense
Punch lines heaven, metaphor is hell
I make these rappers sick, my metaphor is ill
Have more tools than the handyman
Haters on my breasts, no mammogram

And if I want that chop better hit you fast, I’m fast-forward nig
Get that bitch just off you slick, tell ‘er bring your bitches
Gucci in my movie, bring your stitches cuz I’m yelling cut
Bitch you will get baby chug, I ain’t talkin’ bebes
I got girls that look like violin, I let that band play
Bitch I’m on the rampage, you already know I’m lickin’ up
To make me right on Ill Street will tell that bitch I’m pulling up
Keep them tools, no handyman
Said my name and I’m comin’ like I’m candyman

Voices in my head and they keep callin’ me (callin’ me)
Think I’m goin’ mad, man what’s wrong with me? (what’s wrong with me?)
Somebody call a doctor, I’m feeling kind of awkward
Cuz when I’m in the booth I’m like a demon or a monster

Welcome to my danger zone
Where I pop them hammers on camera
Yea, to keep them bangers on
Flow sicker than most niggas and these bitches and they came and they know
Yo, so hard in the pen, got money in the bank over a show
(I show blow)
Big pounds of the kill and I push big wheels and I hold up
From the city with niggas with brand Chevys
And we keep a thing heavy

Can’t see? Roll up
I can’t eat. So what?
Got lean? Pull up
