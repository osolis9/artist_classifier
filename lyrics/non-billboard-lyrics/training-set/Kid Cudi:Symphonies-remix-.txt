Symphonies-remix-:Kid Cudi
Hey Mami...
Hmmmmmuaaahhhh
Yeah. ChhChhh
Mnnah nah nah
let's go
Cudder
Hmmmmmuaaahhhh
Verse 1: (Kid Cudi)
Yeah, I'm here,
Super duper dooder-cud,
All up in the mix like yeah, What!
I stay blazed like brodies,
Even if I never said it you should prolly know this by now.
Ta-Dow, what they go and make up,
Every time I read about stupid sh*t they make up,
If I ever saw them, black dynamite 'em,
Then they have a reason to say why they never like him.

The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out.

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my lonliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see.

Verse 2: (Dan Black)
I lie down in the dust just under your eye
A scrap of paper, thin as vapour
Filling my clothes like smoke
A couple of the wires in my heart are broke
I throw, I miss, something, nothing but
Dreams, schemes, moments wasted
Taste that tasted
Fate I'm fated
Re-edited again then copy, pasted as...

The lights of a car go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my lonliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see.

You know.

Verse 3: (Kid Cudi)
I live, I live, I live, I live for symphonies.
I know that there's some place just right for me.
I live, I live, I live, I live for symphonies.
Oooohh, I know that there's some place just right for me. Yeah.
I'm in it, aint no need to seek it.
I am content,
Dream like content.
So unconscious, just me and my conscious.
I'm runnin with the mobb things,
lookin to do odd things.

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score adds up
Angels play
Let my lonliness get blown away
Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see.

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see.
