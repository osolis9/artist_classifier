Mooching on me, how you deuce people
If I said it then I meant it
Never hang around the soon people
Canonized by my jewels
Couped up in a two seater, with a 2 liter
Spanish twins and they both single
Don't hit my line, she steady throwing it back
Instead of you spending that puy, you should've been
spending the check
Flying the jet, somewhere relax
All of your homies be down for the sex
You got all my dogs in the leach, and they trying be no vet
I'm moon walking, seeing moon people
So high seeing two people
Sour diesel got me day dreaming
A astronaut can be my space teacher
Told a few times I'm a space demon
Fat wood cuz its Bape season
Making money cuz its cake season, yeah

I be grindin, might die today, huh
4-5 past, grabs the Wraith
You be talking st, I past the banger
I be laughing while I'm rolling 60
Dead man, come on and get me
Dead man, come on and get me
Zombie walking till I get it on me
