Like-a-Movie:Loon
Check it out
I'm wit' my man A Con
An I go by the name Loon
And this a bad boy exclusive
Na mean?
Young Marcus, young pretty and heartless

Yo, I tried to be a gentlemen
Even respect the girls who had many men
I had a girl that lived in the tenement straight seduced me
Pretty face, I kept shorty laced in Gucci

She made niggaz wait like groupies
Even made them, lace her hoopty and still ain't hit it
Spend they money, ain't all and still ain't get it
Buyin' bitches is all but still she ain't wit' it

So don't be mad when she callin' me dad
'Rollin' around in the Jag wit the thirty day tag
Some shit you paid for, worked and slaved for
Ever since you met the trick I made more

Chedda then ever before
You 'bout to walk down the ile and I met her on tour
I ain't never had a thousand Dollar sweater before
See ya stupid ass went and got in the bed with the whore
You pulled a no nigga

No way you can't use me
(No)
I'm smoother than that
(I'm smoother)

You wanna live like me
(Yeah)
You will never see that
(Baby)

Live my life like a movie
(Live my life)
How will you top that
(Oh yeah)

No way you cant use me
(No)
I'm smoother than that
(Yeah)

Yo, it's funny how ya money pow
All of a sudden surrounded by these funny style
Chics getting money now bitch had a hunnit thou
Thought she said somthin' slick couldn't wait
To get in bed wit the bitch

I took her clothes off politely
Incase she chose not to like me
That when I ate the hoe out like wifey
Bitch start to like me

Then I flipped her like a savage
Then a nigga tried to rip her body cavity
And she getting a lot a cabbage
An nigga I gotta have it

Been sweatin', tryna hit shit like a rabbit
Now shorty think she established
She givin' me carrots
Buyin' me cars the supa stars be havin'

Clinging to nigga like a magnet, becoming a addict
Actin' like she ain't neva had dick, another dramatic
Always so static, man, this bitch is eratic
Man, I ain't think 'bout that car you could have it

(No)
No way you can't use me
(Use me)
I'm smoother than that
(Smoother)

You wanna live like me
You will never see that
(No, no)

Live my life like a movie
(Live my life)
How will you top that

No way you cant use me
I'm smoother than that
(Yeah)

Now I was pushin' the tan land
It was me, my man Stan
This chic yo when from San Fran
Met her on Pan Dam

Told me her man from Ti Cun, it's pickin' up 1.5 at high noon
So why Loon had to make moves like TiFoon's
Pull a couple a strings botta boom botta bing, it's on now
I got my niggaz and we ready to roll
I got my niggaz and we ready for war

Whateva it be, 1.5 nigga chedda for free
Now how this bitch gone get this chedda for me
I'm ready to see, 'cuz when this shit is all said an it's done
I'm the type to get the bread n just run

My man was soft, I think its better to run
Than to hit him in the head wit the gun, I'ma veteran son
I ain't type the squeeze beretta for fun
I'm not dumb, I do it better than them, come on

No way you can't use me
(See, you wanna be but you'll never be like me)
I'm smoother than that
You wanna live like me, you will never see that
(Baby)

Live my life like a movie
How will you top that
(Tell me how will you top that)
No way, you can't use me
I'm smoother than that
(No)

No way you can't use me
I'm smoother than that
(No)
You wanna live like me
(You wanna live like me)
You will never see that

Live my life like a movie
(Hey)
How will you top that
(No no no, no way)
Now way you cant use me
I'm smoother than that
(I'm smoother)
