Mary:Intoxicated
Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb
Little lamb
Mary had little lamb
Its fleece as white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went
Mary went
And everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go
Then she took it to the butcher shop
Mary's favourite dinner....
LAMB CHOP
Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb
Little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Now not anymore
It's now a piece of smelly shit
Smelly shit
Smelly shit
It's now a piece of smelly shit
On Mary's bathroom floor
