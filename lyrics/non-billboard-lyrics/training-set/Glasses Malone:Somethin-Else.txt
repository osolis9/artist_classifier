Somethin-Else:Glasses Malone
Vicky Shirt, Gucci belt
Tags on my jeans, bitch I’m something else
Gold around my wrist, kicks a half a stack
Oh Lord, I done found my swag
Oh Lord, I done found my swag
Oh Lord, I done found my swag
White bitch, black jack
Oh Lord, I done found my swag

First off this young Money
Cash money, my gang
But east side, set her straight
Nigga, that’s my thing
Blue side, my flat low
Case stairs and assho
He asked for it with that dead mouth
Give it to him, you assed out
I’m with it dog, you know me
You with it dog, come show me
Shoot shoot like I’m Kobe
Have yo bitch come blow me
My top down, my window’s up
My music loud, got a full cup
Doin me if that’s too much
This is truly me not giving a fuck
I’m living it up, living it up
Call that that good life
You kissed her like good morning
I fucked her like good night
Good night – it’s goodbye
Home to that next ho
If you don’t smoke kush nigga
You gon drink head shot
You don’t slang, push nigga
If you don’t rap, patch route
Don’t spit about my life
Got your holster flexed on
Cuz fate will get you fucked
It’s more than that 6-10
Cuz he’ll give, he’ll give
And if that shit nigga dismissed

All I get is pussy, and all I know is money
Every man’s 1200, bitch you know what it do

Rolling rolling rolling, yea she up for molly
And we in this bitch strapped, I’m talking gangsta party
100 racks on that Panamera
I’m switching lanes, she switch again
Talk weed or I can’t hear ya’ll
Doin me so fuck ya’ll
Chain colder than my avalanche
Try me, catch an avalanche
See my pockets, I’m a real gangsta
Cheese balls, you ain’t hear my bitch
Spend is all I really do
Realest nigga than a mini coupe
Streets say I’m hot, rich game on iglu

Ballin ballin ballin bitch I’m sellin blocks
Snort that line it is, I bet your ass drop

Did a lot of trees and that shit come from Catlin
Time to re-up, now I’m going back to Catlin
Back from Catlin, now I’m back in Atlanta
Bag on my bank, yea a gift like Santa
Man a white bitch and I go 2 seater
Remind of the pack when I had the egg beater
I beat that white like I beat Tina
MC Hammer, tell me have you seen her
