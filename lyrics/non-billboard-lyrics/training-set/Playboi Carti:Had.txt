Aye oh

I was brought up different
So my vision different
Yeah, my bitches different
Ridin' 'round tinted
I can't fuck with niggas
I go get it nigga
How I live it nigga
I can't kick it with you
They say that I changed
Went and copped a chain
Went and copped them thangs
Weight all in my name
Fuck me for my fame
Fuck me for the fame
Weight all in my name
Weight all in my name

I can't kick it with you, I be with the mob
All we do is ball, we don't give a fuck
All these niggas want that swag cuz' we go to hard
Swag surfin' on these niggas you can't be a part
And that Ricky down to my toes and heart
Goyard round my waist and it hold the Glock
Poppin' tags, poppin' bags it ain't hard
I got bops, I got thots in the lot
