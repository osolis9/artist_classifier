I was on 119th in Lexington
Black sidekick on the Nexington
Shorty say yo, I look left and then
I'm like I wanna mess wit him

Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out

I was on 114th at the Kingdom Game
AG on the mike doin' his thing
Walked in the park, the screamin' ma name
Stop, now look at the chain

Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out

I Was On 4-5th in the Whippington
Ears naked, wrist was glistenin'
Eyes low like I'm blowin' piffington
Girls talk slick but they whisperin'

Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out

DJ Webstar

And let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it
Let it rain, now clear it out
Let it rain, now clear it out

Chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup wit a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup wit a soda on the side
