Right-Here-Waiting:White Dawg
Never meant to hurt you but I know I did
Knocking on the door baby something gotta give
Chasing all these women
That's just how us rappers live
I know I did a lot of things that you can't forgive
I was so weak when I should of been strong
I was on the road and you were home alone
In the back of my mind I knew that it was all wrong
It's bonnie and Clyde just you and me from now on

I've never been faithful before in my life
Didn't understand the words husband and wife
Every time I cheated on you it cut you like a knife
I'm so ashamed I could take my own life
Trying to keep my image up I lied and hid you
Had to be a rapper couldn't be seen with you
You used to call me late night cuz you really missed me
I didn't even answer cuz I was out tricking
Smelling like perfume, coming home late
Another group of chicks so many damn mistakes
Everything I said to you, you knew that it was fake
A million tears rollin down your precious little face

Never meant to hurt you but I know I did
Knocking on the door baby something gotta give
Chasing all these women
That's just how us rappers live
I know I did a lot of things that you can't forgive
I was so weak when I should of been strong
I was on the road and you were home alone
In the back of my mind I knew that it was all wrong
It's bonnie and Clyde just you and me from now on

Where ever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

So many times I took you for granted
So much pain I know you can't stand it
Embarrassed you in front of your whole family
The way that I acted I should of won a Grammy

Into a million pieces I shattered you apart
You gave me all your trust and I broke your heart
Trying to be a thug out here acting all hard
Late night picking up chicks in your car

I'd do anything if I could take you back
Just you and me in my first Cadillac
You a lil gangster chick wearing my hat
Took it all for granted everything that I had

Never meant to hurt you but I know I did
Knocking on the door baby something gotta give
Chasing all these women
That's just how us rappers live
I know I did a lot of things that you can't forgive
I was so weak when I should of been strong
I was on the road and you were home alone
In the back of my mind I knew that it was all wrong
It's bonnie and Clyde just you and me from now on

Where ever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

Never meant to hurt you but I know I did
Knocking on the door baby something gotta give
Chasing all these women
That's just how us rappers live
I know I did a lot of things that you can't forgive
I was so weak when I should of been strong
I was on the road and you were home alone
In the back of my mind I knew that it was all wrong
It's bonnie and Clyde just you and me from now on
