Round-Round:Far East Movement & Riff Raff
We go round, round, round, round

Everywhere that I go, people know me by the way I flow
I keep it moving in the right direction
And everyday you know that's how I'm living
It's alright

Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown boogie down, I get around (it's alright)
Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown boogie down, I get around

Round where we go where we looking for hos
We line up and knock 'em down it's like tic tac toe
We on a roll spitting flows every day of the week
We might not got alotta dough but we get paid by the freak
We move it east different cities, different girls, different titties
And we get 'em by the dozens call 'em groupie committees
We getting busy like bone all up in college dorms
If you ain√Ç't takin' us home then you can leave us alone

Everywhere that I go, people know me by the way I flow
I keep it moving in the right direction
And everyday you know that's how I'm living
It's alright

Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown boogie down, I get around (it's alright)
Round round, get around, I get around

We go round, round, round, round

Two kids at the Usher show digging for change
Saving up to buy an aeroplane to take us away
My crew has been around the block so all the girls know my game
Plus my milk money is s-s-s-sour way past the date
So if you know where we can grow a pound of? grode? to roll
Rock a show in Tokyo and kick a foot on my O
Put the O wit Oreo we O the power of soul
Round and round we go but where we stop nobody knows

It's alright
Round, round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down I get around (it's alright)
Round, round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down, I get around

Yo, come and get it come and check it see what we got
We about to set it bout the record making you hop
Out ya shoes out ya socks getting hot off the pot
So stay in tune please don't move and keep the station on lock
Cause we fly around the room so hold it down while we gone
Haven't been home in a minute and my head's getting low
I'll be back but gone tomorrow with the wind in the blows
I'm going to rock the microphone 'til I'm a hundred years old

Everywhere that I go, people know me by the way I flow
I keep it moving in the right direction
And everyday you know that's how I'm living
It's alright

Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown boogie down, I get around (it's alright)
Round round, get around, I get around

We go round, round, round, round

It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
