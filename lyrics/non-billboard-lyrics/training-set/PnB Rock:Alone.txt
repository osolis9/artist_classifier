Alone:PnB Rock
Who am I to say no?
To all these bad bitches on my timeline
Telling me that they in love
And they always ask me at the right time

When it's night time
Yea its dark out
Sneak, creep out
Yea thats what I'm talkin' 'bout
Naked pictures in my DM's
Wit' a number and a address to they house

Maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause I'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong hitta
I remember

Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone

But don't you act like
You don't miss the old times
And I don't ever control mine
Don't act like you just don't care

Don't you act like
You don't think about the past
And all the great sex we had
All those good old times we shared
Don't you act (Don't you act)

You don't miss me girl
When we see each other
You don't wanna kiss me girl
I done blown up, I done blown up
And you 'sposed to be with me girl

But people grow, times change like the seasons
And right now I need something to believe in
And for those times that you caught a nigga cheating
For what it's worth it wasn't for no reason

Cause maybe I can turn down 10
But I can't turn down 20
All these bitches wanna have sex
Cause they know a nigga got money
I know I had a girl at home
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
Cause I'm just like every other nigga
Stackin' with the wrong hitta
I remember

Ohh girl
You used to fuck with me
I used to fuck with you
You was in love with me
I was in love with you
But now everything has changed
Nothing is the same
But fuck it
Cause I should have known
That you would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
You would leave me alone
