Inside-Peanut-Butter-Outside-Jelly:Cadillac Don & J-Money
[Chorus] x2 
Inside peanut butter outside jelly 
7 days of the week 7 different chevys 
Black SS wit tha top blown off 
Fuck with them boys get ya top blown off 

[Verse 1] 
got an old white chevy peanut butter top same color 
flows out tha back wood stain to match my leather 
24 inches off the ground like jeezy 
got that thang on me so u better take it easy 
catch me in tha hood knockin bitches out tha wall 
sittin sideways like that nigga Paul Wall 
got a 4-54 and its all chromed out 
just bought a platinum grill like the one up in my mouth 
down south all we do is ride heavy 
coulda had a bentley but i rather ride chevys 
pistol in my lap dnt give a fuck bout tha law

got 10 bad bitches and they all gon call 
got 5 sways and they all gon fall 
old school new school we done had em all

[Chorus] x2 

[Verse 2]
