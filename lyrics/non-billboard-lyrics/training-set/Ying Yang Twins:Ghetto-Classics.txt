Ghetto-Classics:Ying Yang Twins
War, we at war, we at war
We at war, we at
Gimme my rifle, gimme my rifle
Gimme my rifle, gimme my rifle

Let's get this motherfucker back crunk
This is gonna be me and my niggas
We're holdin' triggers in our back bump
To take back what we once had
We don't give a damn about the enemies
Send they out to Baghdad

They put a nigga on the front line
But when it come to gettin' ahead
They put ya way behind
And they supports in minimum wage
They don't give a choice to niggas
They thinkin' we still slaves

Every nigga's got some thug in him
Every nigga's got some love in him
Every nigga's got a grudge in him
Every nigga's got a mug in him
And every nigga busts a slug in him

Now like a cat, bitch, we'll skin 'em
Y'all niggas ain't holdin' my venom
Check yourself, I'ma drop your ass off, bitch
As soon as I loosen my motherfuckin' belt

One for the money, two for the thugs
Three for the projects, four for the love
[Incomprehensible]
And if ya moving too fast they'll get ya caught up like

Ooh, them ghetto classics ghetto, ghetto classics, ghetto
Them ghetto classics, ghetto, ghetto classics
Time for us to find just a little piece of mind
Talkin' 'bout them ghetto classics, ghetto, ghetto classics

We just black people gone and lost our mind
We just really trying to draw the line
Open up our eyes, before we get left behind
Let me tell you something about hard times

Before we used to walk, before we had life in the dry
And 911 wasn't known outside
We didn't know how to read, we didn't know how to write
All we did was sing all day and all night

Then when they let us start learning, you all lose y'all mind
And y'all forgot about the earlier times
When Martin Luther King had a dream
That one day we'd walk together, we really need to get it together

Kids stay in school, learn all you can
Graduate, go to college, get knowledge
Then we shall overcome, yes, we can, we
In the urge of faith we can demand it for real

One for the money, two for the thugs
Three for the projects, four for the love
[Incomprehensible]
And if ya moving too fast they'll get ya caught up like

Ooh, them ghetto classics ghetto, ghetto classics, ghetto
Them ghetto classics, ghetto, ghetto classics
Time for us to find just a little piece of mind
Talkin' 'bout them ghetto classics, ghetto, ghetto classics

One, two, three, four
What the hell are we fighting for?
Passing off, relationship's done what spore
That's why they got the door

More time, hoot hoot, aim aim, shoot shoot
Ain't nothing but the young kids, they recruit
It's a wonder they don't come home in they suit

I took away some time
Thinkin' how I could, should, would be
If everybody in the world was free
No crime, nobody doing wrong

Everybody getting along but when I step into reality
This world is sore and that's why we at war
Killin' ourselves over bullshit that we valued more than life
Y'all people better to get right, 'cause

One for the money, two for the thugs
Three for the projects, four for the love
[Incomprehensible]
And if ya moving too fast they'll get ya caught up like

Ooh, them ghetto classics, ghetto, ghetto classics, ghetto
Them ghetto classics, ghetto, ghetto classics
Time for us to find just a little piece of mind
Talkin' 'bout them ghetto classics, ghetto, ghetto classics
