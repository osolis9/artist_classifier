Get-Down-Club-Mix-:Craig Mack
Aah, now who the flav that comes a dime a dozen
Thinking that is phat but wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack
(Of Mackman)
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down
Like Biggie Smallz might say
I eat'em shits like pac-man
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables
'Cause I does what I do you
(Do it)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin', macking, full effect mike check one two
I'm a reign, rain forever
Rain like bad weather, reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style
'Cause my style ain't a style
That is a style
So I can go buck wild
Betcha figure you got more funk for flow
It ain't so, Flava in ya ear letcha know
Now I'm about a second, from the Hook duk, strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down
The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MCs leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call, king a yes y'all
My style wreck shit, I mean real shit
Shit's thick, I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin'
I wake great the lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake
You sunk by dominate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us, we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a saber tooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down, let me get down
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down
To leap a tall building
Crush the earth-a-phone
But I'm sayin' ain't no fair when MC's roam
The mic now in the right hands
'Cause the Macks and the earths are the worthy of plans
More pep than the peppa thats in ya peppa shaka
Ruff earthquaker couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring
With unknown to mad slang
With bigger bite than the double-bang
I ain't met boot to hand
If ya testin' in ya lesson
Got me dressin' for ya funeral session
Man, it won't even matter no more
Craig in 94' just won the war
My style definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin' look over in a four door Chevy Nova
(Why yi yi?)
I figure its a slaughter
In the world of colins[unverified]
Ya sh*t ain't nothing but a quarter
The name of the track is Get Down
So let me Get Down and pound other MC's in the ground
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down
