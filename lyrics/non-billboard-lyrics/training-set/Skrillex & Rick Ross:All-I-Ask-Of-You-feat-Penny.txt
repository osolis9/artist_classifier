All-I-Ask-Of-You-feat-Penny:Skrillex & Rick Ross
In comes the dawn,
I've fallen asleep with my head pressed against your flaws,
All my love,
And something got in the way,
And your soul turned black as the sun grows somber,
Took my heart, and my love (and my love)

All I ask of you (all I ask of you)
Just open up a little bit more x2
(Just open up a little bit more)
All I ask of you x2
Just open up a little bit more x2
(Just open up a little bit more) x2

Just open up a little bit more (Just open up a little bit more)

Just open up a little bit more x2

(All I ask of you) x2
(Just open up a little bit more) x2
(All I ask of you)
(Just open up a little bit more) x3

All I ask of you x2
Just open up a little bit more x2
(Just open up a little bit more)
All I ask of you x2
Just open up a little bit more x2
(Just open up a little bit more) x2

Just open up a little bit more (Just open up a little bit more)

Just open up a little bit more

Open up a little bit more

All I ask of you, all I ask of you
Just open up a little bit more x2
(Just open up a little bit more) x7
