Sho-No-Love:Tony Yayo
Boosie bad ass

What's up boosie

Bad ass sometimes, it's the unit
These niggaz show me that love, don't love nobody
These bitches show me that love, don't love nobody
I send this out to the dopeman
Yea we miss em now popin is in federal prison
I got no love for these women
These hoes set set ya up get mad
And get they closest kin getcha up
Family family provanity facing gangs to
Love a 4 letter word
But I mean it when I say ya heard
I'm from that dirty dirty south and I mean this
Ride or roam I got ya back southside jamaica queens shit
Real love is when he give ya his last
Real love is something most never have
Mayne I learned from the strret and how these pussy niggaz do
Findin out that they thoughts from day 1 cause they turn bitch to
It's a shame how the game change
It ain't no love in the streets or the chain gangs
Looking for love you gone fall tryna maintain
So play for keeps and keep it street do ya own thang
It ain't no love
It ain't no love
It ain't no love in the city of thugs
Show no love, love I'l get you killed
Show no love, love I'l get you killed
Show no love, love I'l get you killed
Show no love, love I'l get you killed
Yea show no love, love I'l get you killed
Them boys scheming on my team but they know how I'm built
And I can't even trust my kinfolk
Boyyy I stay with the thing cause it ain't a thing to get smoked
Og's coming home on that dumb shit
But them young boys got them k's with drums kid
See me ride with boosie do it big in bousianna
My man l got 12 and ain't even see his grandma
She passed while he doing time up the prison
And his younger brother gotta gun living like he living
I roll the kush and I lean back
I don't trust a bougie bitch, and I don't trust a silly hoodrat
I swear that the phone tapped, they listen to my conversations
And all these swag haters keep on playa hating
Jesus christ he even had player haters
But I'm a shine like him and get crazy paper
