One wrong move and I'ma fuck her
You a lollipop nigga, you a sucker
You broke and she like hustler, I'm rich and I like whores

Hey buster, last chance
If that's yo bitch you better hold her hand
'Cause you don't go to the beach and break sand
I won't choke, bitch you know my plan

And they fitted 'bout as lame as your man

Man you better leave your girl at home, man
'Cause if I catch her in the club all alone, man
She gon' be gone, she gon' be gone
