Let-s-Roll-Dice:Lost Boyz
Mira come estas
How you do, you know my crew?
LB fam, well, well
You know me my man no doubt
We gets down LB fam status
Niggas they be buggin', who the worst, who the baddest
At this, you know I come to wreck
My man S.E.X, what?

Shorty got a nigga back up against the wall
Short an' sweet y'all, about five feet tall
Her and her friends burnin' weed, smellin' good indeed
Yo you ain't what I want, you somethin' that I need
No frontin', I love the way you flick the hips
And you makin' matters worst, the way you lick your lips
Makin' shit hard for me, while I'm in front of you
Tryin' to keep it cool, but yet this what I wanna do
Take you by the hand, bounce you up outta here
But yet I got a show to do, and that won't be fair
You know my peoples came to see me an' they spend money
They won't understand, I bounce with the Ben honey
I tell you what, you play the stage when I get on
So when I get off, me and you can get our shit on
And tell your friends to come along, so we can play the part
Before we hit the stage, we got some more to say to y'all

All we know is drinks, weed and screwin' hoes
Gettin' dough, spittin' flows yo and doin' shows
Keepin' Crys, some pass me that Henny
No ice where the ballers at, let's roll dice

All we know is drinks, weed and screwin' hoes
Gettin' dough, spittin' flows yo and doin' shows
Keepin' Crys, some pass me that Henny
No ice where the ballers at, let's roll dice

V.I.P. chillin' pal, knowin' this year
We's about to make a killin' now
People on the dance floor, lights swing around
You know the LB style, the what, these niggas bring to town
Comfortable shit that you can rock to
I got a extra sack of dough up in my sock, true
This is how we rock, bubble like a speed knot
From the ozone, on and every weed spot
Bunch of clown niggas that you see creepin' through
Thinkin' that they peepin' us, aye yo we peepin' you
Mad at us, we got the chicks poppin' most with us
You can stare but don't discuss, aye yo these hoe's with us
Bottom line, yo these sessy strictly LB
Yo these cats drop the hot LP's, can you smell trees?
Listen, veterans up in the game, you know the name
You know the reason why we came, for real

All we know is drinks, weed and screwin' hoes
Gettin' dough, spittin' flows yo and doin' shows
Keepin' Crys, some pass me that Henny

Booty want the mother, yea, I see you peepin' me
From a distance, ya was lookin' like you wanna creep with me
LB fam, word up check it, hit the booty butt naked
Niggas, yo you better respect it
Lost boyz, like a rizza shit, hold the weight
My whole fam, come to set ya all straight
Jump in the car, peel out, shorty better chill out
Now now, how you do my fam, my crew?

Hey ya, we rule the state up in the scene
Drop the hot shit, that's mean
Only out for one thing, and that's green
And see my team shinin', push the hot whips and keep cash
You got stash, yo nigga keep back
Niggas tryin' to get us, can't wait to find out the source that hit us
It's time to see whose really wit us, yea
Six Minutes till I'm on, I'm up and gone
Shorty dig my ghetto way, she is, she plays along
Lock that ass up like a pit, when it's time to lock
I kick it with ya niggas later, it's time to rock

Run now, how we do now
Stay tight now, ok, alright, alright

All we know is drinks, weed and screwin' hoes
