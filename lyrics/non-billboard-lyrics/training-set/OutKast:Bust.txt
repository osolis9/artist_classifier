Bust:OutKast
Ghosts and goblins run a mock in the caverns of Rhine
Slinging petty corruption the seventh sign

Yeah give it to you and I do what it takes to give it to you
  (Bust bust)

Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckas are the ones that are I chose
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared

No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggaz that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered

Or buttered up buttercup melt your sauce
You a chucky cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer that soft
And I'm sick as a cough did I mention it's raw?

Your predicaments is flaw flaw means fucked up
And serving out the oven not fried slow roast
Slow coast tuck your tail and hide your scared?

Yeah give to you and I do what it takes to give it to you
(Bust bust)

I officially do it with duns on tour
We lock down traps push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz

I serve whipped out of whips whip out cash
Usually keep a g packed under the dash
Try to test my gangsta I bring harm
I'm as slick as freeway rick and Nicholas Barnes

My uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a 4 pound baretta
I'll shoe lace your face just to learn you better
My ox so sharp it cut through leather

My rap name killer my street name skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx
I switch my slang spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast my coast is the south

Yeah give to you and I do what it takes to give it to you
