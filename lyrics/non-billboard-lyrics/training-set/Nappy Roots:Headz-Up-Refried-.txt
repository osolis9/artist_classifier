Headz Up (Refried)
Use your head silly...

[Chorus]
Where yo' head at?
Shawty, where yo' head at?
Show me where yo' head at
Shawty, where yo' head at? (that's all I know)

[B. Stille]
Y'all ain't never heard of B. Stille, the look that seals
Screwed up coupe DeVille, peep the vertical grill
Well Killa Cowboy pull the dirty cowbell
Hell anyway ya do the certified playa
The thickest, the thicker, the better, the pick of the litter
The sicker the chicken, the bigger the dick I deliver
The kidney, the liver, the shiver, the give in her BACK
Make the bigger the nigger deliver the miggity-MACK!

[R. Prophit]
Y'all so ridiculous, hoes all up in my businesses
Got 'em stuffin up my tennant biz
My friend is here, so come around actin shady
I warned ya like (Dick Tracy) like Warren Beatty
Prophit hit it, 2-3-4-5
Kicked it off, 6-7-8-9, from behind
10-11-12, I'm... a glad man slingin geni-til y'all

[Hook: Big V + (Prophit) - 2X]
Want that, get that - (here we come now)
Jump back, get back - (keep it goin now)
Which one? this one - (think about it now)
"She gon' lemme cut that's all I know"
