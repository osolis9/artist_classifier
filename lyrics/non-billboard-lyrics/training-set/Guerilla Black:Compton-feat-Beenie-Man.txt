Compton-feat-Beenie-Man:Guerilla Black
I'm strictly business, just like E P M B
I'm B L A C K from the C P T
Were they dip them cigarettes in P C P
And them broads they believe in me
C I B, the magnum totem
Keep my enemies on I V, once I toast 'em
Just like my bagels
Have 'em like Christians over they head smoking' halo

Call me Plato, I philosophy
Buy the brick, then divided it up amongst my guys
Then I called Lionel, the prince of the Vinyl
Slow up and charge the game like a wild rhino
I know, no one else can do it better
Is you stupid nigga, get your shit together

Badman
Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beanie Man is a Jamaican
Sending my message across the nation
'Cause I'm original Badman
Yo, I'm original Badman
And Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beanie Man is a Jamaican
'Cause we're original Badman

I like mine all black and like Eminem
Not the regular ones, the one that's feminem
Enternin' my dojo, you lose your mojo
My karate chops in slow-mo
Fuck around and knock the hair up off your chest
My shocks turn your brains to a fucked up mess
Unless, I put the potato on the end of the barrel
And watch your soul fly with the sparrow

Call me phaeroe Guerilla, apparels is mink
And sometimes I wear Chinchillas
Yes, I'm the thriller
Whether I pop Crystal or drink Miller's
Turn wine coolers back to wine chillers
Yes, I'm the illest, no one is like me
No that's unlikely

Badman
Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beanie Man is a Jamaican
Sending my message across the nation
'Cause I'm original Badman
Yo, I'm original Badman
And Guerilla Black comes from Compton
And Beanie Man is a Jamaican
'Cause we're original Badman

New Shaq in the Bendigo
Me Black, wear Fendi clothes
Yes, they're many hoes
Yes, they're many flows
The start of the destruction
Assisted by trombones on percussion
Their ushering, a new millennium
My mind process raps like a Pentium

Anyone, anyhow, and anyway
Niggas get fucked up when the mini sprays
Yes, he ran away with shells stuck up in his back
He fucked up with Black
Got hit up with the Mack
Best to stick to act, don't act nonchalant
Yeah, I keep that hardware like I'm Dupont
