Miracle-feat-The-Black-Male-:Miracle
If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearing what I say
I feel your touch, your kiss
Is not enough

And if you believe in me,
Don't think my love's for free
I won't take nothing less
Than a deeper love

Let me tell you
You know I,
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you

Let me tell you
You know I,
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to get me through
Tell me that you understand
And you'll take me as I am
You'll always be the one
To give me everything

Just when I thought no one cared
You're the answer to my prayers
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me
