Rick-James-Interlude-:213
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Doggy Dogg, what's up?
What's up, bitch? It's Rick James, it's Rick James, bitch
How the fuck you gon' do maryjane without me?
One of the best singer's, one of the best lookin' motherfucker's
One of the best most talented motherfucker's ever in music

It's fucked up Snoop, shit, fuck weed
Cocaine's a hell of a drug man, how â€~bout that? That's real
I was in love with maryjane first, motherfucker, I'm Rick James, bitch
I'll break in your house and grind my feet on your couch, bitch
That's how I'm livin', Snoop Doggy Dogg
