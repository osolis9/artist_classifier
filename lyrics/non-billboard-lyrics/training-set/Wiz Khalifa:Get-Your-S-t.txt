Get-Your-S-t:Wiz Khalifa
im tired of arguing and fighting girl
every night you keep callng me
with the same shit, im going insane
i swear i love you
but this aint right for us

i never thought it would end this way
its gone kill me to say
but you gotta.

Pack your stuff, leave my keys
get your shit, gotta go

told you that im moving on
aw you didnt? well you outta know

to shape and mold you
i admit was my mission
but everything went grong
there cause you started acting different
the day you ran up on me

im tired of arguing and fighting girl
every night you keep callng me
with the same shit, im going insane
