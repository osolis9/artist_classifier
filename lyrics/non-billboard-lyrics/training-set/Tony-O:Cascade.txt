Cascade:Tony-O
I thought I told you not to come if you left
Now we here all of a sudden now its sudden death
I'm holding in alot of shit that's been on my chest
I'm the best simply put nothing less
Remember when I said it's only you that see the steps
Now its time to put forth the effort that I den kept
I over slept father now to a father figure
This time is diferrent cause this time I won't beg to differ
Looked at our picture I can't believe I really miss her
I think this liquor got the best of my mental mind I'm bout to pick her
She so fine like she know it's mines
She said she like my music she feeling like every line
Oh my I see her looking at me with those eyes
She won't try cause of that one time before we hit the Westside
Next I'm thinking maybe next time a mess now
I cant believe I seen a reason not to and stress wow
We sat down conversated bout you goin on vacation
you want the greatest and who am I just to go and take it
No im not sayin you wanna stay girl im so impatient
I just hate the fact that I found and now it's taken
Into a lifestyle of being you girl you knew
If you would've stayed we could of did all the things we do
In my mind its DejaVu am I through I Threw in all my chips in this song for you girl all for you
Three letters U OK yeah I noticed it
I played the part but even takin a part of it
Cause this friendship is something I wouldn't give up for no chick
It didnt matter if the baddest bitch say she want my kids
Man this the realest shit I ever wrote
Realest time I ever spoke if y would've stayed this be the realest thing that you know
Wish i can tell you in person the purpose
of being me to to let you know girl that you worth and im certain
And im not talkin bout purchasing purses
We all make mistakes but who are we god to a human
So its planted in my mind so this time I gotta pursuit her
I'll just do itâ€¦.and these niggas is talkin like im goin to lose it
But me I learned the fuckin game like a fuckin student so im alls in five start like a fuckin trooper ill just do it
