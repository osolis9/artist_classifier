Leaving You
[intro:]
Ay ay ay ay ay hurricane ay ay ay ay I can't be wit you no more lil mama.

[chours:]
And that's why I'm leaving you
Sick of everything that you put me through
And I don't wanna be with you
I'm sorry I can't be with you.

And that's why I'm leaving you
Sick of everything that you put me through
And I don't wanna be with you
I'm sorry I can't be with you.

(ay this how it is)

[verse:]
Lil mama I got love for yo ass, but you be trippin tho.I'm sick and tierd of how you trip when I speak to folks at the store. I told you my lil dog got hurt, we had beef, you told me nigga please, you probaly just with some freaks. Now see this just be what I'm talkin bout, I need me a gutta chick, who gon keep it gutta with, Hurricane Chris-agist. Hurricane it don't really matta hold me down, and that ain't wat you doin so you need to move around. I need somebody that's gon cook for me, fix my plate and rub my back. But all you do is fuss and fight, like you just don't know how to act. I'm sick and tired of hollerin, and fussin and fightin, ain't wit it, don't like it, don't do it, not likely. Lil mama I'm a pieces, you could neva be my wifey, you act like you don't like me unless I'm driving something pricey.[repeat x1]

[Verse 2:]
(ay)Okay so know it's getting crucial. I feel like your comments useless. Nothing to it, but to do it, get your bags and get to it. Get outta my bed, get outta my room, get outta my house, get outta my life.And you can't come back and holla when you get your mind right, 'cause as far as I'm concerned you ain't got nothing I like. Need to keep on kickin and walkin the other way. Please stay outta my face, I ain't got nothing to say, but Ay Bay Bay I say that in every phrase. This supposed to be a sad song, but I said Ay Bay Bay. And I can't stand the way you act when people hang up in your face, what that got to do with me, that's your phone anyway. Why in the hell would I give them your number to catch myself up in my game, I am not lame, I got game, H-U double R - I to the Cane. So get your things hope on the bus you came, I think it's by time you swang.And do your thing evrything gon be okay, everything gon be okay.

[Verse 3:]

That's why you gotta leave I'm tired of tellin you bye. Get the hell up outta my sight, lil mama you think I'm lien, here some money for a cab hope you have a nice ride. Ratchet city we go live cut a chick loose with no ties. Now I'm on another mission with my money on my mind, constanly thinking of another way that I can go shine. And when I leave, I'm leaving with the doors suicide. And you betta be out my house when I get back, I ain't lien.
