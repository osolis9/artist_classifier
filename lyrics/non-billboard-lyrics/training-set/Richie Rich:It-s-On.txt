It-s-On:Richie Rich
Let's do this shit
Motherfuckers want they pockets swell
Smebbin' now, dope train, shit, fuck it
1990, ugh, 415, 40 up in this bitch

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

I got a flow so sick it runs a temperature of 101
On the daily, that's why it pays me
And over 3 billion served, yeah, I'm runnin' this like Mickey D
So drive through, if I let you slide through

Could you funk wit a nigga wit a resume
Rich'll never play and every nigga rapping can't come this way
So when I come bow down, 100 per cent
I represent the east side of the Oak town

I throw a boss type of flossy flow
But can you catch it 'cause when it gets hectic
I'm well respected and I'm that nigga serverin' tit for tat
Twamp for twamp

From the hills and the valleys into the deep swamps
I leave no stones untouched when I bust
It's strictly mental
As I load all your dope into my rental

Then kick yo' ass to the curb and when you get served
I let you know, Eastside's what I swerve
Now I'm comin' up cheap, beat after beat
Makin' mail off a known to fluke crew

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

I'm from the old school, yes indeed
I give my right arm for some good gold weed
I went through a whole lot just to feed the tummy
And I refuse to lose the value of money

My shit is real, blunts and phillies
Ain't nuttin' fake like them silicone titties
I'd rather make big bread instead
And regulate, get off in the bitches head

But just like all you toe up hoe's
Niggas wanna test my testicles
Nigga you my nigga, if you don't get no damn bigga
Niggas don't wanna see me when I'm off that damn liquor

Fo' scheezy, what's wrong wit' yo' pimpin', I gets busy
Bitches love when I'm limpin', 40 watch your roll
That's what they tell me back home
When I be gone, but it be on

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

Motherfucker, you don't wanna see me
'Cause in a major motherfuckin' way, fool, it's on, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack, give a dog a bone

Jack of all trades, ballin' like Jordan
You punk, fake inside the paint
In fact I know you can't
Do half of the shit you was claimin' in the county

Suckas on yo' jock, you claim you run the block
Polyurethane, busta you cracked in half
Claim you foldin' bank but I know yo' bank stank
I lived around the corner, I seen you fully smoked
Must I say some moe, you ate a buck o four

Must I say some moe, you ate a buck o four
You sold your TV for a [Incomprehensible] 'cause it was way too late
And when they sent you up state I heard you gained some weight
So youse a baller, lyin' to them youngsters quick
Got 'em thinkin' you sick and representin' yo click

But yous'e a old school thinkin' too much hype
Yo' bicentennial bike, it got ugh, rally stripes
If they knew yo' identity you'd probably be the victim of a stickin'
You ain't got to lie to kick it, I ain't no laggin'
That nigga 40 and his cousin Richard Jackson

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

Motherfucker, you can't even fuck with me
'Cause in a major motherfuckerin' way, it's on
It's like knick, knack, paddy, whack give a dog a bone

Motherfucker
Doo, doo, doo
Da, da, da
Doo, doo, doo
Da, da, da

Motherfucker
Doo, doo, doo
Da, da, da

There's a place in the bay
Where the naked hooches play
And a hole in the wall
So we can see it all
