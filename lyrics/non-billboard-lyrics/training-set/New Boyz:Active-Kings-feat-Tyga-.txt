Active-Kings-feat-Tyga-:New Boyz
You wanna get active
I don't really care, Lil Mama, what's the deal?
You got a nice body
I'm hungry now, baby, tell me how you feel

Because if you ain't there, we can do foreplay
Girl, let's kick it like soccer like Jorge
And have fun in this house, call it horseplay
She like a nigga with some cake like a birthday

Not a little scrawny little nigga doing four days
But don't get me wrong, I'm skinny with a dope shape
This girl tell me skinny niggas got the bigger dicks
Because I pulled out mine and it was bigger shit

I never speak high league on you little kids
And when I say little, I'm talking big kids
You bitch, she let you talk shit, you wear lipstick
Your girl call me ice cream 'cause that big stick

You wonder why I got a nickname and you didn't
She said she barely even hit it, I give her the business, man
Man, you live for this chick, you feel for this chick
But when I come around her crib, I go in on this chick

You wanna get active or wanna get chill
I don't really care, Lil mama, what's the deal?
You got a nice body, you lookin' like a meal
I'm hungry, now, baby, tell me how you feel

Tryna run from me, then brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then she brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then she brought it back to me
Okay

Ah, shit bang bitch, active
Put your fly in the coupe, money in the mattress
Can't fuck this shit' cause she crazy like my last bitch
Might let you get a taste, go on tell your girlfriends

So icky wet, really, really, she a fan
I really wanna put her on but it's no hands
Overnight celebrity off the slow jam
Bad to the bone, bone, baby, you want it

So famished, eat it if it's Spanish
No bandanna, bang my hammer
The girls getting' gooey and the Gucci all wow
Carrera and Louie fuck you in your all gown

Ow, aye, pass on to Ben J
In the rose red mirror, she a devil with a waist
Last King Pharaoh, motherfucker in the game
These niggas ain't thermal, throw it up in your face, aye

You wanna get active or wanna get chill
I don't really care, Lil mama, what's the deal?
You got a nice body, you lookin' like a meal
I'm hungry, now, baby, tell me how you feel

Tryna run from me, then brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then she brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then she brought it back to me
Okay

She got to watch it if she skeet on these
I got that underrated dick 'cause she sleep on me
I close the curtains, she go nuts, no common sense
She goin' German on the blowjobs like erk and shit, ugh

If you gotta go then we can do it in your car
She said my pipe is meaner than a common, so rough start
Of course I'm wearin' latex but first I made her taste it
I went down and did the same shit, make the kitty go like trey pens

My mouth be gettin' all riddle on her clit, real tongue licking
Tony, I'm a pharaoh on the head, well done, get it?
I made it rain, bitch, now get a homie something
She said her name is Paris and this that Dirty Money

Please don't be without a sleeve
'Cause you might get burned like Cleveland 23
Rule Blind scissors to the eye, blind side bastards
YM, 100, West Side, Active

You wanna get active or wanna get chill
I don't really care, Lil mama, what's the deal?
You got a nice body, you lookin' like a meal
I'm hungry, now, baby, tell me how you feel

Tryna run from me, then brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then she brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then brought it back to me
She tryna run from me, then she brought it back to me
Okay
