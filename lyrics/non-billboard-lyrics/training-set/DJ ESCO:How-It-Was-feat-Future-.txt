How-It-Was-feat-Future-:DJ ESCO
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine and I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud, that's how it was
Last night we made a movie I'mma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, bitch how it was
How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, I'mma tell you how it was

Whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Flip it, flip it, flip it
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it
I was self motivated, I was self driven
I got my determination now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lenox
When it come to stackin' cash up it ain't no limit
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talking titties
It's some girls that's gone wild I like to see them kissing
It's some niggas playing foul and they sneak dissing
I won't let her hold me back to complete my mission

It ain't easy when you try to make it out the trenches

Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine and I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud, that's how it was
Last night we made a movie I'mma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, bitch how it was

How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, I'mma tell you how it was

I'm the dope man, dope man yes I am
Turned your baby momma house into a drug lab
I was using all the forks, using all the pans
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands
Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow a lawn mower
I'm a Michael Fox, you're just an Air Royal
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars

I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'mma hustle everyday so I don't never starve

Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine and I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud, that's how it was
Last night we made a movie I'mma tell you how it was

How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, bitch how it was
How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, I'mma tell you how it was

Serve it to you cleaner than the house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working nigga
Got a dogfood connect, DMX nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up

Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money cause I'm certified
All these diamonds round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine and I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud, that's how it was
Last night we made a movie I'mma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, bitch how it was
How it was, nigga how it was
How it was, I'mma tell you how it was
