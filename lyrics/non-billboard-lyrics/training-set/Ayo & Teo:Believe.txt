Believe:Ayo & Teo
Tangled in a web of belief and disbelief,
entertaining possibilities other worldliness civility
I was born of an ancient land beheld on modern feet
I was torn from my mothers hand and sworn not to repeat
all the lives I've lived before, before life taught me death
I was kissed by a gentle wind and given back my breath
and with this, I've learned to sing before I learned to cry
to the heights, of the angels wings who taught me how to fly
and I'm flying over misery and all that it could bring
and I'm dancing over history and I'm uncrowning the king
for the throne he once sat upon is seated in my heart
I made room to invite you in then took the room apart
cause the heart, is an open space not invitation only
love arrived looked me in the face as if the truth were lonely
but the truth is beyond belief as love is without reason
so the moon cried the mellow leaf of cycle end of season
and the leaf it will change and fall before new days arisen
but my love I am here to stay, a kiss within a vision
of a forest filled with laughter filled with sorrow from every tree
this new season is forever, but in sprout beyond belief.
