Da-Dip-Original-:Freak Nasty
This goes out to all the women in the world... especially her
You know, it don't even matter your age; it don't even matter your color
Yo, fellas, I ain't forget about y'all
This is for everybody who like to dance
Just listen to what I'm sayin', and do it, and take a chance
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours, and then I put mine
And we can get down low and roll it 'round
Get on the floor like I said before
Y'all remember that "Down Low"
Just put a little dip with it
Now put those hips with it
Pop it push it rock it roll it
Can't control it? I can hold it
It's all in fun, so take a chance
Just get on the floor and do that dance, y'all
I know you like it, so don't try to fight it
Turn around baby, let me see it from the back
Yeah, I like it like that
Get up now, roll those hips
Drop down double up on those dips
Freak Nasty wanna see, can y'all do this right here for me?
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours, and then I put mine
And we can dip down low and roll it 'round
Back again with the second verse
It's all clean, so I'm not gonna curse
Droppin' bass like a bad habit
Love all women 'cause I got to have it
Comin' at y'all in stereo
I'm ridin' that thing like a rodeo
Hang on, baby, 'cause the ride is rough
And... ["don't stop till you get enough"]
Got my girls in the front
Now a lady just bumpin' that rump
Raise it up, let me see that brown
Slap it girl, make it jiggle 'round
Round and round that rump goes
Where it stop, yo, no one knows, yeah
Freak Nasty wanna see, can y'all do this right here for me?
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours, and then I put mine
And we can dip down low and roll it 'round
Well, alright yall, if you ain't dippin', you must be trippin'.
If you ain't doin' the down low, you gots to go.
To the people thats movin slow to the dance floor...
Yo DJ, pump it up some more
It's off to the show in the limo
Before the show, gotta get that dough
Pay them girls what they worth
Slip that money under that skirt
Take it off baby, let me see
You might get a little more Lucci
G-string havin' oh so much fun
Playin inside between them buns
Shawty got it on like Marvin
Teasin me and she know I'm starvin'
Lick you up then lick you down
But I ain't finished, girl, turn around
Lick you up and down your back
'Cause I'm that freak, I'm freaky like that
Freak Nasty wanna see can yall do this right like me
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put yours, and then I put mine
Then we can dip down low and roll it 'round
Settin' it off to another level
You diggin' Freak Nasty without a shovel?
This is my world, I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut, so what's up?
Yo DJ, when the party's getting slow
Throw on this jam and watch that floor
Takin' over, like in '94,
when I had the whole world gettin' down low
New Orleans-born, ATL-livin'
Freak Nasty's what I'm givin
My juice is sweet like Georgia peaches
Women suck it up like leeches
Uh, huh, it feels so good you must admit you like this shhh --
Yeah, y'all know the song
So come on, won't you sing it with me?
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
You put your hand up on my hip
When you dip I dip we dip
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip you dip we dip
