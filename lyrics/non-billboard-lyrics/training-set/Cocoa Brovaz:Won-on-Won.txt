Won-on-Won:Cocoa Brovaz
Smokin? lah, me got flav
Smoky Gunz, Cocoa B's

Who wanna look like, wanna act like us?
Wanna be like, roll the trees like us
Wanna talk like, wanna walk like us
Wanna flip like get ripped like us

Wanna act like know you're black like us
Wanna flip like kick shit like us
Wanna bust like you ain't rough like us
Tek and Steele, won on won, Smoky Guns, what?

Ding, that's the sound of the bell
Oh shit is all you heard before you fell
To the canvas, all washed up like my dirty drawers
And pants get, try to challenge, get damaged

Plain and simple with bandages around your temple
Easily erased out the picture like pencil
Peeped me once, saw me again, got your pistol
I put permanent fear in your heart like a dimple

Son, hold my A V, let me rock this nobody
Comin' out the closet tryin' to stop my money
Actin' like you're sweet 'cause he ain't see me in the streets
Spit that blood out and get back up on your feet

You called me, I was there on some candyman shit
Wear that ass out in front your kids and your bitch
Hurt you to the boards, put the ten to your jaw
Walk away, parley in front of Ahmed's store

We don't give a what about you, tell them niggaz who sent you
Let 'em come, have 'em all open wide like dentals
Heard they work for cheap, think I might rent you
If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to

Nigga, I'd wish you'd talk about runnin' for guns
Get your Bankhead bounce like insufficient funds
Left ass out a home beggin' like bums
Cut off, swept off the floor like crumbs

I'm from N Y C I T Y, stay high
Lazy eye, ghetto celeb, rap guy from Bed-Stuy
Splash in two lines, me no long rhymes
Losin' your attention, takin' up your time

I gets mine and breathe,? bout it? bout it like P
Too many wannabe me
Wanna flow blow hold dough like Smoky Lah
Fly across seas, blow shows for BCC

But you can't be, you heard me, you soft like porridge
You ain't gettin' money and you have no courage
Introducin', the one who gets you bugged like a loosie
Same height, same weight, same fight skills like Bruce Lee

Try me, ready for those who wanna harm me
Don't toy with me, you wanna be all you can be, join the army
I swarm like bees, plus sting too, bring grooves
I blow 'em out like hankies, nab you like cops do

For the longest I've been waitin' to take it to these Jafaicans
Corner eye ballin' on the moves that we was makin'
Thinkin' that we lost it 'cause our line was closed
Can't stop a hungry nigga with nothin' to live, foe

I'ma see that dough, many hustlers I know
Three car long shark, white chalk and cee-lo
Yo, I think I'll take this time to remind you
Not to sit by the line, test mine, crime stoppers won't find you

Before we come kickin' your door to the floor
Throw you to the wall, makin' you our prisoner of war
Cut you too short to take walks with Tattoo
Attack you from your front, open you back with my scalpel
Snatch two, niggaz from the crew if they got
Anythin' to do with motherfuckers comin' back to avenge you

I intend to get down for my temple, keep a strong mental
When dealin' with evils that men do
Them who fail to comprehend
I recommend you remember you're dealin' with men

Who'll send you off in a coffin
'Cause far too often niggaz are gettin' lost and it's costin'
Body parts from anybody that starts
We play the hackers takin' rappers apart

Dissect 'em from they rectum to they necks
Double check them make sure shit's correct then direct them
To the section, where the session's in progression
Where you come to get blessed by Smif-N-Wessun

Won on won
Won on won

Wanna act like us
Wanna talk like, wanna look like us
Wanna walk like, wanna bust like
Wanna flip like, wanna rep like us

Wanna get clip, wanna kick like us
Wanna get shit, hit just like us
Wanna smoke lah, smoke the black like us
You can? t fuck with us

Won on won
Won on won
