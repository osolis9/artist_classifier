Hustler-s-Theme:Da Beatminerz
Yo, everybody lookin' at me like I'm 'bout to drop
Some real fucked up, dissin' black people shit
Just gone give it here, check it out

Man, it's some cold-hearted shit you doin' dawg
I guess tha-that's the way it is
Yea, folks don't write about this shit
Why you got to focus on negativity?
You forgot that didn't cha, yea, but I see it good now

Yo, I remember when the summer was hot, I'm huggin' my block
The soldier, tryin' to get over with this hustle I got
Lookin' out for the cops, on my way to the top
Ain't no reason to even question if I'm rugged or not

I saw the neighborhood stars drivin' our favorite cars
See they out gettin' theirs, so now we tryin' to get ours
Through a neighborhood tours, goin' through neighborhood wars
Gettin' bigger doors, mixin' this neighborhood sport

We had a powerful team, doin' powerful things
The American dream, I'm about gettin' cream
It ain't just for me, it's for my whole family
This is for all of y'all, I call it the hustler's theme, knah'mean?

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Amidst the dangerous days, and the dangerous nights
The lost wages and the salary heights
I stayed out of harms way, helped my family to fight
When I slipped into darkness, they brought me back to the light

Pray to the Lord above for added insight
A man confronted with these challenges in his life
To the ladies I might, be the compassionate type
Come see if it's real and feel what my action is like

Right, the man of your dreams, I'm handlin' fiends
Fabulous things, more than mansions and rings
A palace built for a king, is how rich'll be
You tryin' to win, get a piece of this victory

And don't ask about my past, that's history
Don't be afraid of the hustle girl, just get with me
You gotta love supreme, but as good as it seems
I'm in love with the cream, this is the hustler's theme, knah'mean?

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Can you stay alive in this strugglin' thing?
Stay alive in this hustlin' thing?
The hustle's only as good, as what the customers bring
Some are no longer with us, others locked up in the bing

See I found a knew trade that I hustle with
It's called hip-hop and I got a love for it
Far from easy believe me y'all, I must admit
'Cuz y'all customers'll never get enough of this

And now you can depend on your local suppliers
The Last Emp again, down with Da Beatminerz
Rockin' wit'chu, we ain't forget 'chu, as we continue
Catch us at the venue, the hustler's theme

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now
