[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
My PO wanna violate me
(I swear I never tell another soul)
Chop a whole 1 hunnid, let off 80
(I swear I never tell another soul)
I like bitches who like bitches
(I swear I never tell another soul)
These niggas talk just like bitches so...
(I swear I never tell another soul)
400 for the lamb, 550 for the room, nigga
(swear I never tell another soul)
600 for a pound, 550 for the O, nigga
140 for the Porsche, 210 for the Bentley
How to fuck a nigga hate to see a real nigga win it?
(I swear I never tell another soul)
(How to fuck a nigga hate?)
Better ask about me, Dope Boy free
Swear the god touched 10 mil, I swear
(I swear I never tell another soul)
Young nigga had no deal, street skills
Big pistols, young nigga soo real
If the town known, put the whole city on his back
And they never took another soul
Never took his back, let's get it

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Fuck niggas wanna live my life
(I swear I never tell another soul)
Who be down with the hoe done tell my wife?
(I swear I never tell another soul)
I guess me and you boy, we beefin' how
(I swear I never tell another soul)
I'll bust ya head when the time is right
(I swear I never tell another soul)
I know a nigga that's doin' life
All because his Codeine had fo'
All his hoe cars and the keys that he sold, that fuck nigga told
His home boy was a Dboy, but he act like a CI
Takin' notes like a PI, carried on like a peon
You see a fuck nigga holler "FBI"
I've seen him on first 48, said he had everything on tape
And he the nigga with the gun and the drum
And his hands hold and fuck nigga turned staple
That nigga, that 5-0 told somethin' 'bout a nigga that put him on on death row
These niggas too cutthroat, and as you knew, niggas got the game all fucked up
