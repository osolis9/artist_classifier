Blast-If-I-Have:E-A-Ski
It ain't the niggas that act hard
It's the niggas that be like quiet like
It's the ones that put the slugs in your ass
And tell your ass goodnight
So get that nigga a marble coffin
'Cause I ain't that nigga t' fuck with
I'm from the O, so I blast often
Motherfuckers wanna test my nuts and be like stuck
'Cause E-A-Ski's shot some shit up
Nigga, I thought you knew that it be on
Never leave the house without the chrome
Nigga, you can fuck around and get your life took
Thinking I won't squeeze this fucking trigger
Till these bullets stop distributing
Cut your ass on the late-night
(Ride)
Trying ta jack my shit but my Glock is seventeen tight
Now ya bent outta shape from the tips, no talons
That I loaded in your ass by the gallons
Now then, why would you fuck with a G?
I don't slang but I throw them thangs and shoot the Glock 20
Many ain't got their ass in to the CP banner, by a nigga
That was well mannered, now you're in for a treat
You don't wanna meet my crew, we blast if we have to
We blast if we have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it don't stop
I blast if I have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it won't stop
We blast if we have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it don't stop
I blast if I have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it won't stop
Shit, I cocked a '94 beamer, strapped with the Glock
I caught a '94 misdemeanor
(That's fucked up)
They had my ass in the tank
With nothing but motherfucking time to sit and think
(Why?)
I had my shit in the first place
A black motherfucker in the O
Witta beamer is the worst place
To be caught with the strap
A ten thousand bail and an infrared Glock I'll never get back
Can't fight the shit so I'm down for probation, waiting
Two years and sixty days in a locked station
Can't fade the 6-0, so I chose the 2
And cut it down, I talk to the youth
Because they can't, I gotta file and some fingerprints
All because a nigga wanna keep his motherfucking shit
Now ya see it ain't no love in this bitch
Strapped on the defense, pull it only when I need it
See these niggas wanna play me for my earned shit
They ain't earned shit, they wanna take, I gotta empty clips
These niggas ain't shit
(I thought you knew, nigga?)
That's why my shit stay cocked
I blast if I have to
We blast if we have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it don't stop
I blast if I have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it won't stop
Oh, he's a mark and he's way outta pocket
Fucking with a nigga from the East side O and don't think I knock him
Fuck you and your raps cos it ain't right
Niggas in the O yell 'Ski' 'cause the track's tight
Motherfucker you can rap and try ta clown
Niggas ain't fucking wit you and your wacked sound
Who's the crew you wanna fuck with?
(The infrared)
Ai yo C, put the beam to this nigga's head
PCP motherfucker, you lost a few screws
And these niggas don't know so I'm spreading the news
Player hater got my name in his mouth
If I shoot this 9 milli, I'm damn sure he'll wash my name out
Closet nigga can't cuff his nuts so he talk much shit
And be fucked when the Glock hit
I thought you knew that it be on like that
It ain't about the biggest gat, it's who's the first to bust a cap
These loco niggas ain't hearing me
I give much love but have to blast if they fuck with me
And no motherfucking sympathy
(The chrome as real as you)
I blast if I have to
We blast if we have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it don't stop
I blast if I have to nigga
Don't make me have to
Squeeze this motherfucking millimeter
And it won't stop
