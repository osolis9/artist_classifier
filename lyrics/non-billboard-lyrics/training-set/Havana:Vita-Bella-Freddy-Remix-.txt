Vita-Bella-Freddy-Remix-:Havana
I wanna wanna wanna close my eyes
Imagine you're right here by my side
I believe I believe I believe in us
No distance between us you're in my arms

I don't need to feel lonely in my dreams
You're with me, you're with me
You came from the stars
Fell into my arms
Stay with me, stay with me

La vita e bella bella bella AAA
Life is Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful aaa

Adesso que tu sei venuta bella qua
Now that you came here beautiful

Ti sognavo ogni sera sera AAA
Dreamed of you every day and night AAA

Oh oh oh

Ti sognavo ogni sera sera AAA

Oh o Oh o

I wanna wanna wanna taste your love
Get drunk with your kiss, give up on words
Breathin' in breathin' out I'm losing air
Got lost in your eyes I'll meet you there

I don't need to feel lonely in my dreams
You're with me, you're with me
You came from the stars
Fell into my arms
Stay with me, stay with me

Shy every time I touch your hair
When you smile you make me dare
Live this life
And then rewind
Join me in this ride
Join me in this ride
