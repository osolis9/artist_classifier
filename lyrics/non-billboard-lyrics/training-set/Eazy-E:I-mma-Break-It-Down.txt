I-mma-Break-It-Down:Eazy-E
My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
Takin' out profanity, so they can play it though
Listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
Going to the record store say ya gonna buy

That the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
So that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits
Takin' my time of Eastline to make sure it fit
Push play on the instrumental that's recorded

Step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
Some sort of track appeared like a plaque
And some hell of a screen from the girls in the back
Takin' a bow 'cause I got style

Never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
Yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short
Guaranteed to help when I walk on the court
So get up make some noise for the gangsta clap

Gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds
So quit playin' around
'Cause I'mma break it down

Last time I was takin' my time with this
But other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
But they was rotten, I was gettin' riper

Ready to go, like never before
Givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
Helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'

Curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
Balls havin' seasons, this is a doc trim
And I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
And I think I'm gonna rock then

You got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
To freeze after I'll cut ya 'cause I'mma butcher
And say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
'Cause a percentage on point bellys are very low

Messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
Like a said before ya get rushed to the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
But ya the dopiest one I ever saw man

I keep droppin' it pound for pound
And when I'm on the mic I always throw down
To keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
So listen now, 'cause I'mma break it down

Now look at me and not the poster
And you could see right off I got the most of
The talent, experience or a trade
And complements for the rhyme that's made

Talks over today if this one so
Pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
'Cause I don't need water to clear my throat

Comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
Nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
Wantin' to get wit' me this routine
Keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean

Can ya dis this man I don't think so
Once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
Comin' out with songs like hit after hit
'Cause this is legit and yours ain't shit

Makin' it sound so dope 'cause I'm a genius
But your amazed with ya happy to see this
Brother go crazy on wax
Flowin' away like if I was on a sax

Doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight, relax and chill
While your uptight pumpin' up the funky sounds
Yo you should know it's kinda persist
That the E is gonna break it down
