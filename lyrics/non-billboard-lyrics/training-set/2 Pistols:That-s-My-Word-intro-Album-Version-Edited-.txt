Don't let his wrist game fool ya
You the deal, be my ghetto princess
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him
That's my word
And if your man can't please you, aint real
Go on and kick him to the curb
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be without him
That's my word

Leave ya man I'm a betta look, why you stessin on me
Way to challenged(?) the ... goddess
And I dont mind if you need time
Just as long as my number get dialed when you decide to walk out
So much stress on these shoulders
We aint gotta fck I just wanna hold ya, so close
Let you know that I'm here for you
Stop cryin, I dont wanna see no tears from you

Don't let his wrist game fool ya
You the deal, be my ghetto princess
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him
That's my word
And if your man can't please you, aint real
Go and kick him to the curb
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be without him
That's my word

That's my word and I stand on it
Take a chance on me
Start answerin those fone calls, there homie
Move on, let's go do us
Im thinkin bout the car seat in the rover truck
Nah, I dont wanna rest nothin
Just wanna let you know how committed I am to ya
Deep feeling for ya
I keep it 100 I'm the realest for ya

Don't let his wrist game fool ya
You the deal, be my ghetto princess
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him
That's my word
And if your man can't please you, aint real
Go and kick him to the curb
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be without him
That's my word

Brand new life, sky blue iced out
Rings quart thous' tonight
Brand new life, sky blue iced out
Rings fly, you my wife

What I gotta do to make you my girl
Take you to the hood, show you my world

Yeah I'm on my grown man
Out in public hold hand
Dont you feel better now that you took a chance

Two seat equip, big body full equip
Hair blowin in the wind, shawty you straight with me
w/ Ad libs
Don't let his wrist game fool ya
You the deal, be my ghetto princess
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him
That's my word
And if your man can't please you, aint real
Go and kick him to the curb
Needta leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be without him
That's my word
