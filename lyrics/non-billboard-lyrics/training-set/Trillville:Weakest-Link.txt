Weakest-Link:Trillville
Ayy, it's your boy Don P right, right Trillville, Corlio
I need all my niggaz to look around, look around
You see some hoes in the atmosphere?

Tell them niggaz goodbye

'Cuz I mean what I say
That's how I agree with myself
And I'm a keep it real

And you should keep believin'
'Cuz if you don't, you're the weakest link and you should be leavin'
Crunk as fuck and ain't no name
To the name that I'm schemin'

Like Michele Vic I'm talkin', shit ain't playin'
So, I don't need a reason
To knock you out the projects
Just take your fuckin' wallet

And make it a fuckin' project
And your hoes can't stop it
Like all around that open ass
I'm ready to shoot

When nigga all you do is fuckin' pass
It's the last day of class
So ain't no need to ask
'Cuz I ain't your teacher

I won't let you pass
I'm Don A..K.A
Slash Corlio

Who put us all on
And the pro's they don't know
And the girls ready to fuck

Right out the barrel of my rugers at you lame hoes
This is how it goes with my bitches matters with a hoe

Right through your dome 'cuz my chrome is my only friend
Nigga don't pretend to be down when you wasn't in
Smilin' in my face, I'ma stab you in the fuckin' back
Dressed in all black with the Tec ready to attack

Nigga you ain't hard, I'ma take your ass up off the map
Peelin' niggaz caps talkin' shit runnin' at they traps

But don't nobody miss you
Your bitch can't even kiss you

So she about to ditch you
Or better yet quit you

So pass me the swizzle
