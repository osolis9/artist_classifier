Take-It-There:Screwball
What, what, what, what
Yeah, yeah
Who the fuck want it?
Yeah, yeah, set it off, niggas
Transform, transform

Yo, I'm at cha'll niggas, assault and battle y'all niggas
My gat splatter niggas, my style dazzle niggas
Screwball empire, Poet spit fire
(Fire)
Niggas wanna die, come, try'a piledriver

My family's Hydra, but we smoke hydro
Mixed with the chronic, some niggas sniff blow
Some niggas smoke dust, fuck around get bust
Severely touched, crushed, your time's up

Ya, rhyme sucks, ya, crew's weak
When the smoke clears, I'll be there, standin' on my two feet
With the mic in one hand and the otha my heat
Represent Vernon, tenth and twelfth street

Man, I brake a broom stick off in yo' ass
For long cash, Screwball blasts the raw facts
And it's long lastin', yeah, a lot of crews are soft like puddy
They see me they runnin' from me, my rhymes they study

Subject, art of destruction, come to wreck
Wanna give props to Mercy for your [unverified] drops
Set it on my man Phil, then my eyes get chinky
Here's kinky, then I'm ghost like blinky

I'm PacMan, lyrics thats written by a mad man
And my grip is like a mental asylum when I write 'em
Ignite 'em like a bullet from my glock when you pull it
To all pieces, when the rough shit releases, yeah

(Do what?)
Pushin' weight back
(Nigga we'll win)
(What, what)
Clack, clack, clack, clack
(Screwball)

(We're the illest)
Can you dig that?
(I can dig that)
You didn't know, only time keep 'em villains
(Take it there)

I wanna hurt something
(Nigga we'll win)
I wanna hurt something
Don't make me do something
(We're the illest)
(What)

Pull the curtains on 'em
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You didn't know, only time keep 'em villains

Yo, understand this I aim rich, aim stainless steel
Aim at the beast when the game get real
Yo, them corna's I been played, got schooled by fame
Said the streets is still watched through closed curtains and screens

QB is like the villian'est life, all across the world thugs
Pushers, pimps and whores
From a blimp I glimpse at the raws
Tears fall, and radioactive street thugs hearin' me callin'
To you my name respect the game [unverified] sixty days home?

Copped the buggy, showed me the love
Ghetto niggas gotta love me
Pop the bubbly y'all, salute the reign of QB
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Aiyo, you niggas, sleepwalkin' out here, a technicality
Nigga, we blaze infront of the kids 'cuz thats how foul it be
I shit on you, take you to the flicks, put a hit on you
Dump ya head in popcorn, turn around and spit on you

I take it there, with ghetto po' niggas, who never had nothin'
We hangin' in the club just to bag som'thin'
Catch a rolly mercin' out about to crash som'thin'
So just get the fuck up out this life unless you have som'thin'

You don't hustle around, you wouldn't mind time
Bitch you ain't a dime, if you ain't improvin' mine
Who y'all, I see through y'all
Fuckin' with Kyron, you fuckin' Screwball
We do some ugly shit to y'all

(Do what?)
Pushin' weight back
(Nigga we'll win)
(What, what)
Clack, clack, clack, clack
(Screwball)

(We're the illest)
Can you dig that?
(I can dig that)
You didn't know, only time keep 'em villains
(Take it there)

I wanna hurt something
(Nigga we'll win)
I wanna hurt something
Don't make me do something
(We're the illest)
(What)

Pull the curtains on 'em
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You didn't know, only time keep 'em villains
