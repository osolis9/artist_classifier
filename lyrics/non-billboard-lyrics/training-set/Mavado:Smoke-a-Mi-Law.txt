Smoke-a-Mi-Law:Mavado
Nothing never sweet mi like a spliff weh mi smoke
Light up a spliff the cloud dark
Naw go burn coke, a swear

Nothing never sweet mi like a spliff weh mi smoke
I swear
A could a who fool dem up? Bout dem gone go burn coke
A swear

Nothing never sweat mi like the spliff weh mi build
I swear
Light the challis it blaze like a ghost skill
Swear

(1)
Naw run no joke and mi naw run no dope
When you si mi in a the sky
Smoke mi a smoke
Is a high attitude a nuh coke mi a coke
And mi smoke in a rome and burn up the pope
It a float pon a boat here comes mi support
Bout beg mi fi stop but mi just couldn't cope
Gone high in a life cyaa si mi through a scope
Mi have a medical card cyaa si mi in a court
Naw go

(Repeat)

(2)
Every smoke gone up
Price gone up
Mi give a draw to mi girl and nice her up
Mi waan marijuana and give her everything
Cause marijuana a the cure fi mi vocal string
Mi si Chinese smoke it over Beijing
Hey schoolsers watch yo under aging
My daddy use to put it in a cake just like a raising
Down to the likkle bwoy Asama ganja save him
Legalize it, every rasta swearing
Like every trees in the forest mi keep on caring

(Repeat 2X)
