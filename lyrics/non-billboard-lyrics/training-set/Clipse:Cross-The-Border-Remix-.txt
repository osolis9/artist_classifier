Cross The Border (Remix)

(Chorus)

you want me to cross the border?

well come on baby

you want me to cross the border?

well come on baby
 Cross The Border (Remix) 


(Boobonic)

They call me A.J., A.K.A. Ant Jones

and aye, the AK tear bones, Homes

seldomely ever talk over cell phones

or chase dudes, I choke 'em like bass tubes

every whip, every bitch, every leather coat

since '88 to right now I was never broke

back then I was V'd up

with a nut cup, problem with the price nigga? see Buck

never waitin' in line nigga, I bump

pay everybody shit just to get to the front

young, did I mention Twenty One?

with more houses that sell than Century Twenty One

cops respect 'cause they know we big

and ain't lock us up for bodies that they know we did

that M shit clean you out like ammonia

imagine '89 fuckin' Appolonia.
 Cross The Border (Remix) 


(Clipse)

Last name Robinson, first name Stacy

I was gettin' Cagney high and gettin' head from Lacy

'88 graffiti, chicks was still masin'

I was a Millionaire when Rick James was freebasin'

I paved the way, showed ballers how to ride today

I chopped the roof off my ride that day

imagine all the hate I made?

used to have to pull my sun visor down for shade on cloudy days

they would shoot up my cars

I would just slide back through with new rims and a paint job

flamboyant like a gold One-Ninety

with a side panel reading, I want you to find me

c'mon, I sold that Night Rider, and it came with a Kit

when you put the shit in the needle and hit it, that was it

Ron..ahem...Heroin, excuse me ya'll

I'm from Virginia where the Southern draw

don't mind me...
 Cross The Border (Remix) 


(Mr. Mister)

See, it's lil' Bucky, my jewels? husky

connects like broads, I fuck 'em but they don't fuck me

who owe me money in the streets? try to duck me

wigs get split like bananas, trust me

keep it butter, call me Land 'O Lakes

got more crack on the streets than Cali after earthquakes

Southwest gon' vouch for this

our teams trade off nicks (Knicks) like Ewing and the draft pick

easy money, that was all in Eighty-Nine

locked down every block, made all gravy mine

Gucci slides cost Three-Twenty-Five

I, pulled up in the Three-Twenty-Five I

and A.J. bought a Joe-Paul-Mary

silk shirts, his gators was Blueberry

and this the shit OG's used to do

scoop every young boy and treat 'em to City Blue.
 Cross The Border (Remix) 


(Fabolous)

It's like ya'll don't know beatbox, I was O.T. at Twelve

given a half at Six, an O.Z. at Twelve

ain't nobody come near the minor

that was runnin' spots in both North and South Carolina

by Ninety I was already a crack legend

pullin' up a year early in a brown Ac Legend

I ain't cop from Uptown, I re'd by the shores

and I could go a month straight in Fila Valores

the way I used to equip with my features

I was comin' to Junior High School in better whips than the teachers

'bout my paper, I ain't even think 'bout the chicks

but I kept everything Gucci from my link to my kicks

beatbox Mike, I learned to cook as a child

got knocked for attempt, the best lawyers looked at my trial

got Five at Eighteen, I took it and smiled

came home in Ninety-Two and flooded Brooklyn with valves

I'm back...
