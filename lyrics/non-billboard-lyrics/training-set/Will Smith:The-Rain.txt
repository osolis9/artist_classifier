The-Rain:Will Smith
Yeah, uh, uh, can't feel the rain
What, what, we 'bout to do it like
The little rain drops falling down on me
And I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The rain gonna come through the window pain gonna come
Black white rich poor, it's the same old drum
Rainy days like a war use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'

Let the children feel the rain, 'cause if they feel the rain
From the wettenin' they stand to gain
I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm artists like flowers they bloom

Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pop said rain gonna come to him, I said never

Cheddar in the genes, face on screen
Benz with a sheen but what did it all mean
I earn money and burn money, credit cards smokin'
Platinum, grammy's famous but still broke and

Not having cash, put me in check, yo
The road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fog is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then the rain, I never felt, deal with it

The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me
The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurricane
Her first name still conjures the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget love is a four season concept

Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan, from it I never ran
Followed my heart through the storms
And my umbrella in hand

I'm Noah life's my ark, 40 days and 40 nights
Still can't take my heart
Seen a fallen man to dope and liquor brands
Devil a dance to make it rain, bringing the pain

Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soaking wet but mastered the art of peace
To gray skies I grew wise on bended knee I knelt
Since then the rain I never felt, what's with it?

The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel i, feel it
Feel it coming over me
The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

Sometimes I sit in my room stuck with my mind stressed
Can't rest so I open the blinds
Seen kids in the streets running around
It wasn't touching them but the rain was coming down

I wondered how with my mouth wide
Reminisced as a kid, I said I wanna go outside
In the rain to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time God started rapping to me

He said, "Pain is the mother of change
The rain must flow so the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid find shelter in me
The road to greatness through the valley of adversity"

I felt the light as he proceeded to drop the gem
These little children the world we must receive like them
I just smiled and thanked him for the cards he dealt
And since then the rain, I never felt, what's with it?

The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me
The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me
The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me
The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

The little rain drops falling down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me
