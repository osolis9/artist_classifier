P-Diddy-Intro-:Loon
The years 1975, a star is born
The place Harlem that's were we from
The home of hustlers and money makers
His name Loon

It's your turn now kid show 'em what you got
Young party and heartless, young Markus, this bad boy
We give birth to motherfuckers like this
Destined for greatness the legacy continues
Show 'em what you got
