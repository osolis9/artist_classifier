All-My-Dogs:Sage The Gemini
H-h-h-holy shit

All the clips never fit the gun
I pull up, you know what's goin' on
Let my dogs loose off the chains
Oh Lord, here we go again

Pull up all in all red like Larry the Lobster
Fuck up your posture with this inuyasha
Yeah, I just wanna make money and spend flame
You're a Dragonballs and gold cooler than I came
Okay, Westside, my fingers rest up, Jack
Wheels supposed to get billings, ride 'em both back to back
Man, it's real complicated
Can't believe that I made it
You know the big homie stretch, but me, I'm from the pavement
Owe that nigga my loyalty, rags to fuckin' royalty
Platinum records, I'ma buy him a house off of the royalties, wouh
And fuck 'em all, get rich
You're fuckin' up the plan, you're a bitch
GGT

All the clips never fit the gun
I pull up, you know what's goin' on
Let my dogs loose off the chains
Oh Lord, here we go again

(Yeah)
(Yeah)

Let my dogs loose off the chains (yeah)
Oh Lord, here we go again

(Yeah)
(Yeah)
