Nookie-GH-version:Limp Bizkit
I came into this world as a reject
Look into these eyes
Then you'll see the size of the flames (size of the flames)
Dwellin on my past (past)
It's burnin on my brain (ah)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day (days)
My girlie ran away with my pay
When fellas came to play (play)
Now she's stuck with my homies that she fucked
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat, hey

Like a chump (hey)
Like a chump (hey)
Like a chump (hey)
Like a chump (hey)
Like a chump (hey)
Like a chump (hey)
Like a chump (hey)

Should I be feelin' bad? (no)
Should I be feelin' good? (no)
It's kinda sad I'm the laughing stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (move it)
But I'm a sucker like I said
Fucked up in the head, not!
And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break
But my heart will ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny

I did it all for the nookie, c'mon
The nookie, c'mon
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your... (yeah!)
Stick it up your... (yeah!)
Stick it up your... (yeah!)
Stick it up your...

Why did it take so long? (why)
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one
Underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (but you were)
Not by my so-called girl, but in reality
She had a hidden agenda
She put my tender, heart in a blender
And still I surrendered, hey

Like a chump (hey)

I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you, just let it go
It's easier said than done
(I appreciate it) I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone (leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone

And nothing gonna change
You can go away
I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same

And nothing gonna change
'Cause you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same

And nothing gonna change
'Cause you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same
