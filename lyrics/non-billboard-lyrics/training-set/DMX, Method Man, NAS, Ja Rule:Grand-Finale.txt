Grand-Finale:DMX, Method Man, NAS, Ja Rule
I ain't goin' back to jail
Next time, the county or the state see me
It's gonna be in a bag

Uh! This is it baby, end of the road, ha hah
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon

Watch them young guns that take none
Nobody safe from the Friday the 13th
Ghetto Jason, itchy trigger finger achin'
Snatch yo' ass out that S-Class for fakin'

Forty-fo' blast is a bloodbath, take your first step down
A thug path, ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
For the weak to last now, behold the unstoppable

Third eye watchin' you, watchin' me
Throwin' rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me

'Cause we family for better or worse
You and I from the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard
It hurt to be here, and each year, I'm pourin' out more beer
For deceased peers, holdin' fort

Police line, 'Do Not Cross', they found his corpse
In the loft with the head cut off and butt naked
Homicide the crime Method
Add another killer verse to the murder record
The Grand Finale

Who wan' test me, c'mon!
Me shot pussy-hole fi fun

Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem
My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin' niggaz who pumpin'

Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin' they gats
Fiend yellin' out, who got those? Go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough

Thug faces, fugitives runnin' from court cases
Slugs shootin' past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down 'cause he feel us

May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the swat team to come and kill us
But dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue
One'll live to get revenge and we ride to the end

Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, the Belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit, I tried to tell him on the streets

It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggaz from the hood, hangin' off his teeth
We slangin' to eat, bringin' the heat
Bullet holes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh

When you a dawg you a dawg for life
(Ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love
(See eye to eye)

Give us one shot at life
(Let us fly)
Come on niggaz!
(We dawgs for life)

When you a dawg you a dawg for life
(Ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love

Come on niggaz!

There's mad money out here dawg
Mad money out here, what you tryin' to get it?
(Word up)
You gonna bust your gun to get it?
(Tsh, whatever yo)
I hear you I hear you

Uh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, 'cause I know it's a dream
Niggaz that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob 'em
Niggaz that know me well see me and think I'ma problem

I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God, I turn your last name to Underwood
'Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D

The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you

Drama, it's right here, how much you need?
Beat you down with gat see how much you bleed
How much you plead for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin' up out that ass you feelin', gettin' realer

Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over! This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

When you a dawg you a dawg for life
(Ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love
(See eye to eye)

Give us one shot at life
(Let us fly)
Come on niggaz!
(We dawgs for life)
