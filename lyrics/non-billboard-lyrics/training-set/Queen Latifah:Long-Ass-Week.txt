Long-Ass-Week:Queen Latifah
You may not be living the life that you want
But tonight you gon live the life that you want
Gotta get as high as you want gotta let it fly if you want
You might not be living the life that you want
But tonight you gon live the life that you want
Gotta get as high as you want gotta let it fly if you want

Yeah - works over another day of your life passed
Your body’s screaming your mind is waving white flags
Ducking and dodging life’s left hooks and right jabs
Not to mention everything comes with a price tag
But tonight let’s put your problems aside
Let all the bullshit depart let the bottles arrive

If anybody blows your high tries to mess up your buzz
You betta tell em you deserve it because [You had a long ass week]
Feelin like the longest week of my life
And I’m so ready to be myself whether I’m wrong or I’m right
Cause tonight we do it my way
Crusin down the highway
Look up to the sky just thank God its Friday

You had a long week chasing that dollar
The boss man stressing you makin you holla
It’s friday night and you ain’t working tomorrow
I bought the club out go head and get you a bottle

Sayin I ain’t leaving till like 5 in the morning
I ain’t gotta be to work until like 9 Monday morning
Its Friday night and you ain’t working tomorrow
I bought the club out go head and get you a bottle

You had a long ass week

Yeah the week has finally come to a close
Cause every hour every minute you gotta stay on your toes
Work harder play harder than you ever could imagine
And your boss be stressing you so anything could happen
It’s ok to walk around without a care in the world
It’s ok to tell the truth without a dare in the world
It’s time to sweat out all the pressures from your 9 to 5
Open your eyes cause its time to get live

You had a long ass week

Feeling like the longest week of my life
And I’m so ready to be myself whether I’m wrong or I’m right
Cause tonight we do it my way
Crusin down the highway
Look up to the sky just thank God its Friday

You had a long week chasing that dollar
The boss man stressing you makin you holla
It’s friday night and you ain’t working tomorrow
I bought the club out go head and get you a bottle

Sayin I ain’t leaving till like 5 in the morning
I ain’t gotta be to work until like 9 Monday morning
Its Friday night and you ain’t working tomorrow
I bought the club out go ahead and get you a bottle

In the morning I’ll be coming home from the night before
In the morning, oh in the morning
When you feel it, feel it flowing through your bones
You gotta move your body
Oh tell somebody

You may not be living the life that you want
But tonight you gon live the life that you want
Gotta get as high as you want gotta let it fly if you want

You had a long ass week
