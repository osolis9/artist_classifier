Princess-Of-The-Posse-e-DJ-Mark-Remix:Queen Latifah
Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me
forgive the crowds o lord they know not why they sweat me
biting's against the law in the place that i live
so i lock up the door with the keys to my crib
the call me the high priestess of this hasta
although i'm not a dread and not a rasta
there's never been a word i can't master
i've always been a piddly pastor
i reign the lesson of today
you have to listen to each and every single word i have to say
because the ruler lord ramsey is on my side
and i'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light
The princess of the posse, me say she a cool one
she rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
the princess of the posse, me say she a cool girl
she rhyme brooklyn, the bronx, usa, the world
You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern
i bounced it all around you like the rings around saturn
let me know now if you'd like to protest
and proceeding a greeting, or would you rather progress
onto a higher plateau, to the peak and i'm taking it slow
enough for you to see the knowledge and to know
i'm the q-u-e-e-n, l-a-t-i-f-a-h
queen of the army posse, the dla which is
get live alright, you standing there chewing on your fingernails
nervous, watching me doing the live thing
singing like a bird sing, ringing like the phone ring
i'm the queen and you're the underling
i'm never following, i follow nothing
the princess of the posse is a cool one
The princess of the posse, me say she a cool one
she rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
the princess of the posse, me say she a cool girl
she rhyme brooklyn, the bronx, usa, the world
I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand
i step over suckers to position myself to rule this land
it's a concoction, for my ability
to show the skeezers the meaning of humility
cause they don't know i'm the one to fly one or two
i'm snatching hearts cause i'm latifah and i want to
i find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip
i'm kicking gold, so grab a hoe and get a good grip
stop the lying, the trying
the time buying, you've been denying
you're dependent on me, the princess of the posse
i got the cards, so i'm dealing a death blow
you're taking no crowns, put that on cease
my dj's name is mark the 45 king to the posse
peace, got to let you know where i come from
the princess of the posse is a cool one
The princess of the posse, me say she a cool one
she rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
the princess of the posse, me say she a cool girl
she rhyme brooklyn, the bronx, usa, the world

Now take run the family
me say me have to do it for the r.e. posse
you try to be down, you can't take the crown
maybe from someone else but not me (repeat 2x)
