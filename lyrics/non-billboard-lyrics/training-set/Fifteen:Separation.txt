Separation:Fifteen
And if I turn away, maybe I'm just too afraid to let you into my life
Let you into my heart, maybe I think you won't like what it is you find
And if I run away, maybe I'm just too afraid to let you into my life
Let you into my heart, maybe I think you won't like what it is you find
And if I leave today my intention is not to be away
And I know the only worthy act is union
I'm not seeking distance, only somewhere where I feel safe
I know the walls between us are the illusion, so I say
The separation between you and I is just an illusion baby
Cause my eyes can't see what your mind thinks about what it is my heart is feeling
And your ears can't hear my mind is screaming, want to let it all out but I just drown in doubt,
And I want you
I had a dream about such a sweet young girl, but now she seems so far away
Had a dream we would be together forever, but now it seems so far away
And now she seems so far away, because nothing lasts forever
And sometimes dreams seem to fade, because nothing lasts forever
Sometimes I think tomorrow will be much worse
Sometimes I think that I should just give up today
I had a dream about justice in our world, but now it seems so far away
Had a dream about peace on earth, but now it seems so far away
And now it seems so far away, cause nothing lasts forever
Sometimes I think tomorrow will be much worse
Sometimes I think that I should just give up today
Never give up
Cause dreams are what make the world go round
