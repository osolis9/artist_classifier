God-Church:RiceGum
I was broke but I'm living in the hills now
I was crazy but this ice made me chill out
No 's, I need blue on my bills
I'm not like Kylie Jenner, everything I got is real now
When I'm out, you be staring like a sightseer
I will not call her baby, I'm not like Bieber
I don't ever give an F like a nice teacher
Fuck it, I'm just keeping it like a high fever
Thought I told you that you need to go and wash your face
You're, she's you trying to catch a case
DM after DM you was trying to take me on a date
Go vlog stop rapping trying to ride the fucking wave (splash)
They used to hate, tell me that I wasn't going far
Look at me now I be pullin up in foreign cars
Which one?
Bitch I cannot pick one
He said it's the rari or the range or the big one (Aye)
Y'all ain't, really doing much
Nah y'all ain't cool with us
Hate on me you fucked up in the head, like Supercuts
I'm in the hills just Uber up
I'm not paying I do enough
Your girl like Blac Chyna, 'cause all she wanna do is fuck

Ouu
Your girl on the track she sound better than you
Someone dissed me, I don't know, I'm like "who?"
Said I cashed out from last song it's true
And yeah I just spent your whole rent on some shoes
I hit the club and I'm leaving with two
Verified 'cause all these checks that I blew
Your girl on the track she sound better than you
Someone dissed me I don't know I'm like who

Shut yo ass up
Go and get your cash up
She done got ran through
Magcon
Smashed up
Your man gave you followers don't know why you gassed up
I'm running with the subs and the views you can't catch up
Used to be a big fan I'm your fuckin idol
Hit me up tried to link but I'm not a bio
Can't rap like those blonde brothers from Ohio
Now I got em all doing songs trynna take my style (Aye)
Money talks yeah my money gets annoying (Aye!)
Juice digger chase the clout from your boyfriend (Aye!)
Bitch I got more plugs than modem (Aye!)
I got carrots in my ice like a snowman (Aye!)
How you gonna let your girl have a better verse
That's your girl? She a stick, she ain't got curves
She a hoe yeah You fell into the thot curse
Dropped merch and it's selling like a god church

Ouu
Your girl on the track she sound better than you
Someone dissed me, I don't know, I'm like "who?"
Said I cashed out from last song it's true
And yeah I just spent your whole rent on some shoes
I hit the club and I'm leaving with two
Verified 'cause all these checks that I blew
Your girl on the track she sound better than you
Someone dissed me I don't know I'm like who
