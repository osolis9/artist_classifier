My niggas all we do is put down the smash
While ya'll playa hataz keep comin wit trash
I'm everything ya'll been lookin for 
Everything that keep ya'll straight hittin the floor
Lil' girls in the hood, I got 'em all shook up
Tryna fing this nigga so we could hook up
Even girls 18 they be tryna sneak
They find all kinds of ways to get next to me
I'm the don of this new millennium
O-H-I-O is where I'm from 
I might of sadi it before, but I'ma say it again
Since I stepped ya'll niggas can't win
It's the B-O dub, all in the club
The reason that girl keep shakin her butt

Gots to keep it goin' on
Wit' Jd on the track, how can I go wrong?

Girl that talk slick
I don't want that
I want me a nice girl type
That ain't really been touched
If she all in the mix
I don't want that
Cuz those be the types that talk to much
That five double O
I don't want that
I want me a six with the tricks and the TV in the roof
That bottle of Mo'
I don't want that
Bring me the pinneapple, cranberry, and the grape fruit sour
Do it, ive flavor flow like fluid
Swallow I'm tryna keep ya'll dancin, like never before
Screamin' at the DJ, give me some more
It's So So Def and we don't play
Put it down like this everyday
And  in the A-T-L-A-N-T-A, G-A, is where I stay
Now March
[Da Brat]
You gotta find a way to turn it up man

A big pimp (you know me)
And all I do is find 'em
Love 'em and flee, it's like that 
It's Da Brat and I'm nice (you know me)
And if you dont' believe 
Step, step, step up
I'm bad like Mike (you know me)
And all I do is keep on makin' the big, big  bucks


NIggas wit no dough , I dont want those
broke in the club all night holler at any ho
Pretty boys who feminine I dont want that
I need a thug to keep my adrenaline pumpin' fast
Hook up my grandma wit a fresh new V
with a note attached tellin her U love Me
The six-o-six-four-four and I'm too nice tp stop the flow 
Rock some more
So So Def is the family
We on top and that's how it has to be
From JD, to Bow Wow, JE, and me
Everything we drop so hot continously
If the sex ain't freaky that ain't me
And if the check ain't weekly, we can't be 
I'm stil a big thang getter
Big Momma the brat from C-H-I-C-A-G-O...
