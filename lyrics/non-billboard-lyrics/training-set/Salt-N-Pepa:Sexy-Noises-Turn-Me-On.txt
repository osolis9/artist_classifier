Sexy noises turn me on and on
Talk to me and you can't go wrong
I love the sound of your voice when you make love to me
And you caress my lips with your tongue

Love it when you whisper down my ears
(Ooh baby)
Love it when you breathin' down me face
(Ooh baby)
Love it when you rub down me spine
(Ooh baby)

'Cuz every time I hear the noise comin' from your lips
You're gonna feel the rotation in my hips
