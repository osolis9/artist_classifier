Set-Me-Free:Savage
Yeah, yo I need you to hear me on this one
Give me five minutes of guitar
There might be something here you might understand

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free

Have you ever had that feeling where you just felt lost
And everybody in your circle got they two-face on
And you can trace your steps where you came from
So you get down on your knees to bring you closer to God

You're asking, "Are You punishing me?"
Lord, I'm on my knees forgive me for all my sins I've done
And set me free, I need a bed in my life to make it positive
'Cause I don't want to die but I don't want to live

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free

God spoke and He answered my prayers
Not with words but He brought me to tears be patient not greedy
So I fought through the years and that's why I'm standing here
On my own 2, me and my whole crew's the one

That hold true stick by your side
For everything you go through and that's the whole truth
My music's God's gift so I don't want to die
Because I got to live

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free

I don't want to die, I know I've got to live
No need to feel that way, God's got a plan for me
Sometimes I feel alone but I make it on my own
Every night I pray I'll make it through each day

Yeah, well, have you ever came to that point
Where you didn't know what you were here for
You didn't know if God gave you a gift
Or if there was a God? See, you're at that time

Where you just sit down and pray you talk to God
And you're like it'd be funny nonsense
But instead of talking to you
He shows you what you're here for

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free

I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
I don't want to die, I don't want to live
God, please help me, Lord, set me free
