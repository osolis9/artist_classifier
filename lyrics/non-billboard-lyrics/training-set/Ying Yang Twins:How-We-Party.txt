They got party and they know us...

Everybody get fucked up
Lights up but we lit up
Slum dog with two cups
Tell the DJ turn my shit up...
Talking out of my crank heal
But I’m all fays like crank hill
Feeding it no sleaze
I’ll tare it up on this sleeve
My gell-o on my ear to me
They try to hold me down but on bodily
5-6 till blast down
Count me down by the take off
All aboard I hope you got your team
To get fucked up and wee here to nod
