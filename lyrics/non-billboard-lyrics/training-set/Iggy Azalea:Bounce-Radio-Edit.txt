Bounce-Radio-Edit:Iggy Azalea
I don't wanna hurt ya but I'm about to work ya
Watch your mouth drop real low
I'm turning you up, I'm burning the clutch
Full speed, both feet to the floor, feet to the floor
DJ running it back once more, time to party that's all I know
Grab somebody tell 'em, "Baby, baby, baby let's go!"

Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)
Make it bounce
Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)

Iggy Iggy, gettin' 'em tipsy
Tippin' in brah, to hundreds and fifties
Pullin' up, NASCAR, black car
Shittin' on everyone, sippin' whatever we feelin'
Real real good, hands to the ceiling
Dancin' we dizzy, we spinnin' we spinnin'
All about money, the night's never ending
We party till morning, tomorrow we kick it

Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)
Make it bounce
Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)

Let ya hair down and shake that shit, shake that shit, shake that shit
Sweat it out, go nuts in this bitch
Dip it, spin it, and watchin' my hips
I see you watchin' my hips
Crazy, move your body like Swayze
Round and round, shake it, break it, make it bounce
It's a fucking celebration, go-go-go
Girl shake 'em down like you made it, get low-low-low
Then show the good like you're wasted, pow-pow-pow
And spray the crowd with amazement,
fo' show-show-show

Go nuts, hands up, get crazy (we go)
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy
Make it bounce
Go nuts, hands up, get crazy
Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)
Bounce, shake it, break it, make it bounce
Oh-oh-oh-oh (repeat)
Bounce, shake it, break it, make it bounce
