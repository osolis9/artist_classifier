I'm so motherfuckin' true like I'm 2 Chainz
Ridin' in that Mayweather with your boo thing
Every summer I pop up with some new chains
In these Balmains filled with them blue things
And these hoes on my back like my Fendi
You niggas need to e.n.d the envy
And the troopers stop my car just to frisk me
Big stash in it they think that it's empty

[Verse 1]
When a real nigga talking please don't speak
My watch tried to take your bitch from me
Dead 'mens in my pockets all hunnid
Bitch I'm sippin' right now don't even touch me
No, I'm not sippin slow
Just pass me the ball
I'ma pick and roll
I'm out there getting dough
Gettin off the dope
Sosa what's your goals? I don't really know
But I know I want a new house, new shit, new money, new that
New this, new thot, new bitch
Everytime I have mood switch
New Gucci, new Louie
New shirts, new pants, new kicks
New drink, new weed
I'm surrounded by a bunch of new shit

[Verse 2]
Big stash pot in the car for a fuck nigga
Soon as I see you creepin' up imma bust nigga
One thing about my pistol we got lots of trust nigga
He know he's a throw-away and he don't give a fuck nigga
Don't let my niggas catch you on that rough nigga
All these waves I feel like I'm Puff nigga
At the top it's just us nigga
If you ain't with us, we don't really fuck with you
I'm countin' cash on my ten fingers or my ten toes
When I wanna be low-key, I'm in that Land Rover
You can put me in detox, don't think I'm staying sober
Jump in front of this metro train, and get ran over
