Fiend-Of-Misery:Militia
enter a time where demons weave your dreams into reality
can this be your worst nightmare come true
but can i believe-what is this
can it be the truth
believe what i say
tell no tales
the truth will lie
on the seventh day-you will die
return as i and put an end to this hell
this cant go on i must live to tell
believe what i say
the key holds time to release all
you must know what lies within
looking back now i realize
i've found serenity from the cold
as time goes by i grow old
and the wisdom i seek grows near
for the ones who knew they will follow you to carry out your plan so evil, so divine
behold the blinding light of darkness as you release your last breath you taste death all is black and it is i who stands before as evil fills the sky
