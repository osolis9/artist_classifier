Ten-Toes-Down:NAV
Yeah I took a couple of L's so you know I'm on the road now
Keep a bad ass bitch and she always stays ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl you know I gotta know now
And I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl you know I gotta know now

Sometimes thats how it goes
Took a couple of L's, so you know I am on the road, I am all alone
Call my shawty, yea she down to roll (uh)
My bitch inspirational, her pussy sensational, their ain't no replacing her
Bitches ain't real enough. She peeling a backwood up. She fill it with stinky stuff
Put the work in the truck in the spare tire
Your daddy won't know that it's there shawty. You asking why I'm paranoid shawty
Because in the six they ain't playing fair shawty
In the club you won't see me there shawty
Because niggas want know my when and where shawty
So you know I gotta be prepared shawty
All I really know is you down for me?

Yeah I took a couple of L's so you know I'm on the road now
Keep a bad ass bitch and she always stays ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl you know I gotta know now
And I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Ten toes down
Is you really riding, girl you know I gotta know now
Gotta know now, gotta know now
