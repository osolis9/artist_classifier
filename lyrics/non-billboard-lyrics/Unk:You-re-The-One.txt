You-re-The-One:Unk
(Sean Kingston):

Kingston, DJ Unk, for the ladies,
Let me touch you up and down til you say stop,
Cus you're the one I've been searching for cus you're so hot,
So let me touch you up and down til you say stop,
Cus you're the one I've been searching for cus you're so hot,

(DJ Unk):

This girl is super thick,
This girl is super fine,
This girl is so sexy,
That I can't get her off my mind,
I met alotta dimes,
But you're one of a kind,
She rubs me on my neck and sends chills down my spine
She got the lips,
The hips,
The booty,
The nips,
Babygirl is all that and a bag of chips,
She's hotter than tabasco but I just gotta ask yo,
