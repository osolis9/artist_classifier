Last-Call:Offset & Metro Boomin
Come pick me up
Cause Ive had it up to here
But that's not enough
A little more can't hurt so fill it up
Then grab yourself a beer and lift it up.

Heres to better days that lie ahead of us.
They may come soon

I feel it coming like a cold went down my neck
Our times are right
So here we are
Cause weve been drinking, singing right here at the bar
And here we are
At first to change

Just hear me out
Lets drive out past the lights outside of town
Were only here so long so let it out
The whole world seems to shake when it's coming down
But tomorrow you know right where I'll be found
We never change
At least when rearing when the nights are all the same

I feel it coming like a cold went down my neck
Our times are right
So here we are
Cause weve been drinking, singing right here at the bar
And here we are
At first to change

Come pick me up
Cause Ive had it up to here but that's not enough
A little more can't hurt so fill it up
Then grab yourself a beer and lift it up
Heres to putting off our date with destiny

I feel it coming like a cold went down my neck
Our times are right
So here we are
Cause weve been drinking, singing right here at the bar
And here we are
At first to change
To change
