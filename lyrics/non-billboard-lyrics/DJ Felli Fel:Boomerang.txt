Boomerang:DJ Felli Fel
3, 2, 1 now put your hands in the air, shake your body down slow
Hold it, bring it, bring it back like you never did it before
Keep your hands in the air while youre dropping down low
Let me see you work it out, like a stripper on a pole

ok, if you came to party tonight,
I need you all to get yo all drinks in the air
Keeps your Ciroc bottles in the air,
and if you see a sexy lady right now,

Your body looking amazing when youre dancing like that
Girl get up on the stage and go ahead do your thang
Sexy beautiful lady wont you bring it right back
Go head pull on it lady youre my boomerang (boomerang boomerang)
