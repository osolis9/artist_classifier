Sorry-Lil-Mama:Lil' Flip
Sorry lil mama I gotta go
Not tryna hit and run ya but I got another show
It's already check out time plus my plane leaves at four
Give me them digits
At a later date I'll f**k withchu some more
Meanwhile rollin on chrome
Every lil mama I run into wanna take me home
Tryna give em my lil fair share
Because they all want this bone
So don't get mad at me if my cell phone is on roam
I'm just tryna get some dome

(Lil Flip)
Now if you rollin wit me come now
I'm a gangster
I never put my gun down
I can't drive girl cuz I'm high
I see yo belly ring
Plus you got a butterfly
28's when I roll out
10 clear coats on my coach ride
What's your name
Where you from girl
I got a presidential suite you can come girl
I got cris by the case load
What the hell yo baby daddy in my face fo'
Now I'm reachin for my waist hoe
We got chicks in every state bro

The whip paid fo'
She starin at my watch
I'm like what you in my face fo'
Ha
She heard alot of gank
She want alot of gangster
Ride wit a gangster
I'ma type of gangster
It aint bout the fame
She just diggin my nature
It aint bout the change
She still wantin the paper
I'm feelin ya style
And ya classy ways
I want my child in ya stomache
But not havin my baby
Anyway

I'm a one night stand man
After this night
I'ma dump you like a trash can
Like I set you on fire
I can put you out
I want ya gas can and I can be ya water spout

I gotta Sprint
And a T-Mobile
And a Nextel phone
And all three of em ringin from bad ass bitches that wanna bone
Take one of two calls
Take on to the telly
And take one home
Cuttin corners barely missin the crib
Try not to break her bone
WHY!
I'm sittin on top of 83's and fresh ass meat
A nigga tried to jack me for em so I left his chest open last week
I'm rude as a mothaf**ker
But I get nice when I recieve head
Might fall off for a minute
But I get back right when I recieve bread
Chop em up wit something
Shorty thick
Go straight to the bed wit it
Run her on the low low cuz someone's always watchin like a fed visit
Crucify the coochie then cut a couple of corners
Crusin quick to end and quit this
Before I fall in love
