Playboy:Richie Rich
Come out and play
Playboy
Playboy

Whatchu know about that? Ahh
All bad bitches, lock windows, lock doors
Fake pimps lock hoes
Niggas with diet game too late stole clothes

Real bitches fuck with deez and not those
When I'm at the club and they pop the doze
Nigga keep ya eyes open, watch the hoes
Could it be the walk foo? The shoes or the clothes?

Or maybe they be bound to the game I throw
It's the raspy, genuine, into mine
When I'm on the field keep him on the sideline

That soft shit you spit, it ain't tight
I never known the hoes to bite on game light
'Cuz it ain't right to slide through in S Fish
Lauren's a dish and deals with the best bitch

Trick I shoots this
Like Marcus Ray-Boy
I bring it to life 'cuz I'm a true playboy, nigga

Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin' you much, much more
Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin' you much much more

I just knocked a euro bitch in a mazarate
See Rich, pimp hoes in tennis shoes and gym clothes
But I'll boot a bitch who got ass like she's black
Love to fuck me, Bruce Lee sucky, sucky

Now I run hoes of all nationalities
And when I'm in the zone, her breasts might be silicone
Might catch me on the stroll with a bad bitch
I'm checkin' loot, nigga, listen to the game I shoot

When I'm out alone
I seem to knock straight hoes
Be on the lo, lo
But niggas screamin dat's they hoe

You come and get this bitch 'cuz double R got more
And what I do, my stable stays stuffed like glew
I put my vocal on it cnd call me raspy, nigga
9 hoes, fine hoes, don't even ask me, nigga

I ace 'em up
My shoes, my bitches, lace 'em up
It's the real McCoy
A O.G. Playboy foo'

Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin' you much, much more
Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin' you much much more

Since I'm gonna be
Heres a map, for the wanna be's
The game pick up, niggas
Stick away quick

Why push 19s when I could slip on dubs
And check this, once or twice a day switch fits
Be a heat packer, safe from the street jackers
I rock ice, the type of cat to hit a block twice

Call up once, sac run up, baby, no fronts
Smoke blunts, only let her hit the light once
Compare, so damn different than a playa
The first one, he be the worst one

Bitches to the left, me and my cat Hew Hef
Play me, y lose the L and pay me in [unverified] toes
That's the type of shit I tell hoes
Prefer puppies that drown in the game like guppies

Now they swimmin'
Straight lakes, born to chase women
Play it slow
My lifestyle's smoother than Trojan nigga

Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin' you much, much more
Playboy, he's runnin' the game straight raw
Playboy, he's givin' you much much more
