No Effort"

With no effort
With no effort
With no effort

I can do this shit with no effort
You know I do this shit with no effort
I can do this shit with no effort
Nigga None

Choose took a house I took yo bitch took that hoe to town
Played my role so good after I took a hit I took a bow
Take some pounds for a pound take yo time take it serious
I'm curious should I buy me a watch or a aquarium
Get yo sack took we gone take you for a joke
If you like that last batch bring some money take some mo
Wanna take him to the A don't know which route I wanna take
The country way four years we take presidents everyday
Nigga take me to the horse not the club bitch the Porsche
Hoe then took off with my dick I should be taking her to court
If you take me for a hoe I'm a take it to your porch
Only fear the lord anybody else can see the morgue
Give me 30 seconds with her I can get this bitch naked
One bullet out that K ah leave the toughest nigga headless
Dog don't need one drug to act reckless so act sober he'll up and put one in a nigga melon
One time for my deuce, one time for my pops, free tweak, rest in peace T, fuck the ops
One time for Lil CJ, One time for Lil Rock, 50 rounds in that chop, niggas moved niggas dropped
One time for Waun though we did that bid in K-Wop
Play with me it's going down bitch one time for Young Joe
One time for Cocaine Cash nigga off top
One time for them [bird sound] we got coming by the flock
Nigga one time for a real nigga Lee Hustle
And Lee can bust you
You a fool if you think Lee tussle
My running back come from Cali and make P's fumble
Think I work at McDonalds I make that cheese double
Think I'm making big macs I let that bread triple
I got a big mac that bitch ah shred niggas
Saying my name better stop while you ahead
Before they look for your body and find nothing but yo head nigga
I don't wanna fuck If I can't get the head with it
You see the trophy hoe you talking to the bread winner
Lil ungrateful bastards I can't stand niggas like I
Ain't play they parents role when I fed niggas
Like lil nigga I can do that shit with no effort

You know I do that shit with no effort
I can do this shit with no effort
Nigga
Shout out to my niggas cause they grind for em to shine
Shoes blood red bottom like they ride under the fine
In Gwame with my bitch we at Ve Coy Hoyle?
Niggas hating but ain't never been off U.S. soil
Nigga this mornin' I started off my day with a map
And a prayer that I made it there and back
Bro this yo bitch so why she sitting on my lap
Let that chop clap and push a nigga head off his neck
Was you watching the news you saw them indictments
Ok, so you know I'm stating facts
Last niggas we was beefing with (UUUHH) man I
Can't even think of what cemetery them niggas at
It'll come to me later it's on the tip of my tongue
Nigga, How meet gangsters, crips, lords, and bloods?
Nigga, How meet plugs talk over dinner about funds?
Only thing you meet is the requirement for a crumb
Ya'll pussy niggas homo ya'll ain't got no hoes
These bitches tired of fucking around with hobos
Extendo on the glock that bitch long as a pogo
In Chicago at Soho FN like I'm RoRo
Fuck nigga I can get you knocked off with no effort
The clip hanging out tonight like it ain't on tether
Girl say when she with me she get so wetter
Said she like to throw that ass on the load catcher
All black and its late night
Assault rifle with a steak knife
Big 40 eat a nigga up
But the doc think it was a great white
Red bottoms on my feet like my shoes got brake lights
Fuck her and drop her off no time for no date nights

Like lil baby I can do that shit with no effort
You know I do this shit with no effort
Watch me do this shit with no effort
Nigga
Ahhh!
