Breath in now breath out
Hands up now hands down

Now I know y'all be lovin' this shit right here
L.I.M.P Bizkit is right here
People in the house put them hands in the air
Cuz if you don't care, then we don't care
One two three times two to the six
Jolts in for your fix with the Limp Bizkit mix
So where the fuck you at?
Punk, shut the fuck up and back the fuck up
While we fuck this track up

Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up

Move in now move out

You wanna mess with Limp Bizkit?
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit
Because we get it on every day and every night
See this platinum thing right here?
Well we're doing it all the time
So you'd better get some better beats
And uh, get some better rhymes
We got the gang set so don't complain yet
Twenty-four seven never begging for a raincheck
Old school soldiers passing up the hot shit
That rock shit and bounce in the mosh pit

Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up

Move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breath in now breath out
Hands up now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Come on
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
What?
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Yea
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Hey ladies, hey fellas
And the people that don't give a fuck
All the lovers, all the haters
And all the people that call themselves players
Hot mommas, pimp daddies
And the people rolling up in Caddies
Hey rockers, hip hoppers
And everybody all around the world

Move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breath in now breath out
Hands up now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Yea
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
What?
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Come on
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Move in now move out
Hands up now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now
Breath in now breath out
Hands up now hands down
Back up, back up
Tell me what you're gonna do now

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Come on
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Yea
Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
