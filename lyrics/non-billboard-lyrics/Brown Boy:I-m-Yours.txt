There's a special dedication that i gots to make
To that very special girl who came in my world
You fall from above and you gave me your love(yeah)
You show me hapiness so I gave you my best
And I gotta thank god cause I know I've been bless
To find a girl like you that will always stay true
You we're there by my side when I depended on you
When i give up on life you have me breath again
You help me spread my wings so i could fly again
And for that, I love you like my mother
You always stay close to my heart like my sister
and my brother, i know
I'll never find another quite like you
Cuz ever since I met you, was then
No more clouds, no more rains(no more tears to cry)
No more tears to cry and no more pains
I hope you feel the same so we can share my last name

When you hold me, when you showed me
That Im your one and only

Let me take a second to dedicate the song
To my one and only
who's been there for me
Through other things that I walk through on a daily
Girl you're my rainbow on my cloudy days
The next thing that took away the pain
If this world afflicted, you wanna feel gifted
Pass me with an angel from the heavens above
You we're to catch me when I fell in love

(Together)
Im own, find someone to call my own
Who's love me for me and unconditionally

I never thought this could happen to me
I never take for granted who was handed to me
Appreciated and adore u (I adore u)
And through the bad times girl Im gonna hold you
And through the good that we share
Yeah we could smile together
