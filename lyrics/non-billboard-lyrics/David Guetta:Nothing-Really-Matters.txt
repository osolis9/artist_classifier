Nothing-Really-Matters:David Guetta
Watching the world, watching them all go insane
Look at them all, look at them do evil things
So I go out and dance, party my problems away
Look at me now, look at me dancing again

In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
But the beat

In a club
I rock club like, come out at night
Shot 'til daylight, hot models, my type
Let's go, take flight, explode, dynamite
Disco black light in the club

Party people rocking hardcore in the club
DJ rock the fucking dance floor in the club
Hot mamas dancing, oh lord, in the club
And I just came to rock all out to escape from the world

Watching the world, watching them all go insane
Look at them all, look at them do evil things
So I go out and dance, party my problems away
Look at me now, look at me dancing again

In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
But the beat

In the club
Feeling like a star when I walk in the house
DJ spun that record and he burned down the house
Just like MC Hammer, I'ma 'Turn The Mother Out"
I'ma rock the dance floor, uh, check me out

I came here with my people, we gon' fuck up the place
I was stressed out so I had to get away
The world is going mad, I think they going crazy
So I just gotta break on out

In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
In the club nothing really matters
But the beat

But the beat
But the beat
But the beat
But the beat
