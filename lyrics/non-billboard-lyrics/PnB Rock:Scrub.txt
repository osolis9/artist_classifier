Scrub:PnB Rock
Remy

Girl your ex keep calling
Fuck him we balling
I put double G's on you, I put double C's on you
I put Louis V on you, that nigga a scrub
He can't take you out, that shit is a dub for you

You should change the number to your old phone
Tell your ex, nigga leave you alone
He stuck in the past, he ain't got no cash
I swear that's just bad for you
And this where you need to be
Top floor of the suite
Fuck you on the beach
Cups full of Hennessy
Backwoods for the weed
We on a hell of a high, but he always killing our vibes

Girl, your ex keep callin'
Tell him leave your ass alone
Girl, your ex keep callin'
Tell him leave your ass alone
Tell him leave your ass alone
Ex keep callin', might have to buy you a new phone

Girl, your ex keep callin'
Fuck him we ballin'
I put double G's on you, I put double C's on you
I put Louis V on you, that nigga a scrub
He can't take you out, that shit is a dub
Girl, your ex keep callin'
Fuck him we ballin'
I put double G's on you, I put double C's on you
I put Louis V on you, that nigga a scrub
He can't take you out, that shit is a dub for you

I swear he a bum
He ain't got no crib, he still living with his mom
He ain't got no car, he still riding in the Uber
He ain't got no choice, that nigga a loser
Listen lady, you the only one that started thinking that he crazy
You the only one that ever thought that he was wavy
You the only one, you got that nigga going brazy
Shawty you a baddie
And you got a fattie
Ask my ex girl, you'd be lucky if you had me
I just want to show you the world, you can have it
And you know a dub mean you lovin' the fashion

Girl, your ex keep callin'
Fuck him we ballin'
I put double G's on you, I put double C's on you
I put Louis V on you, that nigga a scrub
He can't take you out, that shit is a dub
Girl, your ex keep callin'
Fuck him we ballin'
I put double G's on you, I put double C's on you
I put Louis V on you, that nigga a scrub
He can't take you out, that shit is a dub for you

In Barclays we milly rock
Louis on my sock
Gucci on my top
Niggas still on your top
Girl your ex keep calling, tell that nigga to stop
He ain't got no pockets
You should put that nigga on hold
Girl your ex keep calling
E-e-ex keep calling

Girl, your ex keep callin'
Fuck him we ballin'
I put double G's on you, I put double C's on you
I put Louis V on you, that nigga a scrub
He can't take you out, that shit is a dub
Girl, your ex keep callin'
Fuck him we ballin'
