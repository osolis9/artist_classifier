Everlasting-Bass:Rodney O
(Rodney O)
The bass that's in your face, sho' nuff shrugs your face
Just like you got sprayed by a can of mace
You see your speaker is movin, everybody is groovin
My song moves along as it starts improvin
The highs will get no higher, the bass will go no lower
'cause everlasting bass, sho' nuff moves a flower
Some people can't take it, they try to plead the case
But you can't get enough of everlasting bass

Joe's as fast as Carl Lewis
He's black, not Jewish
And when he's on stage, he can (scratching) do it
And I'm good to go, yes Rodney O
Leader of the show, make the ladies say "Oh!"
King of my castle, causin much pain
You dumb shrimp wimps, it's you I tame
So to the are, to the O, to the D-N-E-why
Now what's that spell? Rodney, that's right

Me and Joe are on the go, movin fast, not slow
Sportin Filas and Adidas and some are Kangols
We ride on 747's, not DC-10's
We'll take a 3-day vacation and we'll do it again
Check in the hotel the day of the show
No time to play around because we got to go
You see we're on a flight, to rock the mic
In Miami, Florida where they film the Vice
