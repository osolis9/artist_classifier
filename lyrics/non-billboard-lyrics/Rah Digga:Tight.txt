Tight:Rah Digga
Yeah, Rah Digga, Flipmode, Outsidaz
Shit tight, down to the coochie
Yeah, check it

And I say what's tight
'Cause a sista write rhymes all day and all night
Dwellin' South of the Hudson, New Jerusalem
In seclusion, using fake pseudonyms

Mind travels like a Skitzo on two tabs
With doo rags hangin' from my pockets
Me, the rap bitch that goes back to pediatrics
Early left rappers like you were straight vexin'

So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive
Off of five two fives, disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
For takin' mad niggaz titles

Wetter than a resevoir, lurking in the bushes
Striking blows like Chesamar code-name 'Hasana'
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana

Now, who be writin' rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and my plans is tight
Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

A Black Queen, ya best believe my black jeans won't say Paco
I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel
Rap very tight liquor got me different
Dirtier than an overseas shipment of KI's

I write these Tight Buttas, creme de la guttas, call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God
That gets blunted, watch rhymers runneth, over

See me in the camel Range Rover
Chop and I won't stop for Jake
And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate
Now, show you the way to blow, better than I tell you

Word to my beeper and my cellular, what? Polo curls
Diggin' all the rapper's shit like they go-go girls

Now, who be writin' rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and my plans is tight
Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

Who the tightest? I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest
So don't try me 'cuz I be the bitch
I'll leave you twisted like a thug with blonde hair

I blow up the spot like Dennis Scott
Go forward, your chance of defeatin' me is morbid
'Cuz I get you open like the comin' of the Pope
When I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit

Peace to niggaz I rhyme wit'
My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin'
I decompose, any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and Y chromosome

So 'See My Name' tagged in bold or Italics
'Cuz I'll be the only one salvaged
Number one imported like Beck's
Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX

Now, who be writin' rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and my plans is tight
Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

Now, who be writin' rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and my plans is tight
Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

Tight, tight, aight?
And the plans is tight
Tight, tight, tight
Tight, tight, aight?
And the plans is tight
Tight, tight, tight
One, two, three, four
