Don-t-Stop:Lil' Cease
Uh, yeah, uh, one, two
One, two, one, two, ya'll
Uh, uh, yeah, uh
Yo, yo, yo, yo

It's Lil Cease nigga about to blow charm like pop
In the Benz drop, I'm hot you're not
Pedal to the floor, four, fifth [unverified]
I'm the nigga you're bitch love to clock

Be the artist standing raw gettin' head in the lot
Outside of Justin's in the parking lot
Keep the feds on the low, in the darkest spot
Like Jigga, my lifestyle is just hard to knock

A nigga with more juice than 2Pac
My crew moves spots
Three for my niggas in the yard in the box
[Unverified], all a nigga got, I'm a ball till I fall, land on acres

Get this paper, smile like Don Juan at Gators
If ya feel me on this, then my words will save ya
If ya wanna talk to me, nigga talk paper, shit, fuck em
I want potatoes, now fuck later [unverified]

We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop

Uh, yo, yo, yo
All a nigga need is one shot, one brick
Four niggas and four clips mo thugs and four-fifths
We car-jacked a few whips apartment on the hot strip
Feds come, we lose it, pissy off of party and bullshit till we max out

If it's beef then act out, nigga so fuck all ya'll cats wit ya ass out
Yappin' 'bout ya crack house creepin' on the low
C-Gutter tear his back out, I ain't scared a ya'll
Trust me, ya'll ain't ready, ya need to bring ya bitch

'Cause she more heavy than metal
My gun's rock steady, the more the merry
Niggas hall ass, break fast like Mob Berry [unverified]
Before I land three like Dell Curry
(That's real)

I'm tryin' to blow like Kurtis
All that shit you doing, is makin' me nervous
Nervous, join the service that paranoid shit could hurt us
Kill us down at B.I.E. for B.I.

Nigga, it's reality, you wanna battle nigga, bring ya large salary
And ya whole team to tackle me, nigga
Who be the last to fuck after me, money L, D-Rock
Niggas ain't fuckin' wit me

We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop

Yo, yo, yo
I'm a switch hits on niggas, drop hits on niggas
Switch V's on niggas, platinum to the quadruped on niggas
Two to the point to the five on niggas
Run hard with the wildest niggas

In a cut, can't find us niggas, livest niggas
Ice be shinin' niggas, blindin' niggas
In the four point six, reclining niggas
Bitches like 'Damn, I got to find this nigga'

If I give her seven digits, got to dial this nigga
And you know I'm on top, you got to watch me nigga
And my dogs shoot the ball till you foul me nigga
And when the beefs on, you gon drown, my nigga

I'm a rise for real, and wish death to the fake ones
This is for my niggas that was down since day one
That bid long, hang in and hang on
Hold ya head and stay strong, my niggas

We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop

We won't stop, till you niggas come and stick me
And I don't stop, till you haters rock wit me
And I won't stop, till I'm dead here wit fifty
And we don't stop, we won't stop

And we don't stop, you know who run the city
And we don't stop, till my dogs rock for Biggie
And we don't stop, till the feds come and get me
And we won't stop, we don't stop
