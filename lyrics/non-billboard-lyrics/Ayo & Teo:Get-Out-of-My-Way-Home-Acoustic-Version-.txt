Get-Out-of-My-Way-Home-Acoustic-Version-:Ayo & Teo
Get out of my way
It's not the let to say
I don't want to go, straight
So get, get, get out today

Would you around in circles
On a big, on a board
Each round i'm getting mostress
Cause you block my way home
Would you i'm in danger
Cause i rather to kill
So if you don't want swallow my anger
You should keep your who and shem
Just keep your who and shem

Get out of my way
It's not the let to say
I don't want to go, straight
So get, get, get out today

Get out of my way
It's not the let to say
I don't want to go, straight
So get, get, get out today

Would in my memorities
Since you've been forgot
Don't in their hope your sense more grow
You've been to board
And now you really want it so

It's not the let to say
I don't want to go, straight
So get, get, get out today

Get out of my way
It's not the let to say
I don't want to go, straight
So get, get, get out today
