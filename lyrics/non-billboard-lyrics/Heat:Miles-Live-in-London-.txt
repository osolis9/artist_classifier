Miles-Live-in-London-:Heat
She's been sleeping in the subway, walking on the highway
Counting all of the stars at night
She's running to a dead-end
Broken heart it won't mend
In the search for a life

I don't know what it's like
to live on that other side..

I, I can walk a thousand miles to be with you
I'd catch your falling star
I can walk a thousand miles whenever
No matter where you are
'Cause I know you can make it
Why you gotta break it, baby
'Cause I'd walk, a, thousand miles

Calling out a mayday
Her story's getting jaded
Nothing is what it used to be
No longing for tomorrow
There's only pain and sorrow
In the search for a dream

You don't know what it's like
To live on the other, side..

I, I can walk a thousand miles to be with you
I'd catch your falling star
I can walk a thousand miles whenever
No matter where you are
'Cause I know you can make it
Why you gotta break it, baby
'Cause I'd walk, a, thousand miles

Guitar solo (Interlude)

You don't know what it's like
To live on the other side..

I, I can walk a thousand miles to be with you
I'd catch your falling star
I can walk a thousand miles whenever
No matter where you are
'Cause I know you can make it
Why you gotta break it, baby
'Cause I'd walk, a, thousand miles
