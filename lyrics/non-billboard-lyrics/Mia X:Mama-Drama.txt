Mama-Drama:Mia X
Ya'll best to back the fuck on up
It's Mama Drama my nigga
I'm Shiva with two heaters
See I'm hardcore my nigga for sure my nigga
Ain't never been scared before my nigga

Ghetto from head to toe
When I got some lyrical foe my nigga
The mics the fo fo when trigga
Launchin' my verbal scatter

That shit ya'll do ain't worth the urine
Sticking in my bladder
The yappin' and the chit chatter
Don't even matter 'cause nothins fatter
Than rapper's faces after I verbally gat ya

Beat 'em like they was Hagler
Rip 'em like no good paper
That's why they duckin' Mia X
Hip hops new heavy weighter

The soldier hater, disentegrator
Major paper maker
The gangsta rhymer, big timer
I'm Mama Drama

Uhh, where my real niggas that we can ride us
How many soldiers down to do what they gotta
Like Mama Drama
Uhh, where my real bitches that we can ride us
How many soldiers down to do what they gotta
Like Mama Drama

Street date in all 51 states
They can't wait to hear my lyrical murder
The grim reaper, Mama Mia diva with the nerve
Ta sabotage y'all, dressed in camouflage
Is my disguise daily

I'm a batterd woman that's surrounded
By them sharp kitchen knives, baby
You gon' realize that I ain't to be played with
I get payed with TRU and I'm a made bitch

So what cha you wanna do? Better call your crew
And tell 'em to come correct
But everything this way sho gon' get Xed
Hexed I'm a voodoo mistress
Roots on all my lyrics, Ri, Ri

Strong enough to make AMC
Don't fuck around, huff puff, then I blow 'em out
Then they all fall down now
They done told ya, you gon' know
