Visceral:Fat Pat
It's not a mystery
The way she smiles, smiles at me
The words from her mouth make the friendliest sound but her eyes
They say everything

Close as close can be
Without treading the waters of a love-soaked sea
The jokes and the laughs and the late night chats that's all we need
(Or so it seems)

With lips that spark all sorts of ideas
She calls my name and I appear
Everything about her
Puts sex on my mind…

There lies a fear in me
Between these ears privy to her history
I know her her lovers don't recover once uncovering her in...
...sanity

Cue her cunning ambience
As I notice the second bottle's nearly gone
The stage is all set, a visceral vignette
Down to the blurring edges I'm done

With lips that spark all sorts of ideas
She calls my name and I appear
Everything about her
Puts sex on my mind…

It's dangerous at your place after six
Cause you're a beautiful fire
Burning on my desire
To kiss your lips would be to kiss you goodbye

Enter the temptress
She starts to undress
Now there's no room for hearts between our bodies' movement
Welcome, disaster
She's going faster
Oh my brain's migrated south and now my everything is living in the moment
This is our moment
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
It's wrong, wrong
But come on, come on
Black thong, gone
"V" marks the spot
Let's go!

I said it's dangerous at your place after six
I said it's dangerous at your place after six
Cause you're a beautiful fire
Beautiful liar
You burn me with my
You burn me with my
Visceral desire
Animal desire
Oh yeah!
