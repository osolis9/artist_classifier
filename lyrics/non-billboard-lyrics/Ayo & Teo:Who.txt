Who:Ayo & Teo
Chorus:

Who can I run to?
Who can I cry to?
Who can I trust with my life if I have to?
Who can I give love to if I need to?
Who, who? (x2)

Colors are fading
All the lights gone dark
And it won’t stop raining
Everybody’s gone
And my joy is sad
Craving for love and happiness

Chorus:

Tell me who can I run to?
Who can I cry to?
Who can I trust with my life if I have to?
Who can I give love to if I need to?
Who, who? (x2)

Time keeps flying away
Though it feels like my life is on hold
My love for you won’t change
I’ve pushed you away though I still need you close
And my joy is sad
Craving for love and happiness

Chorus:

Tell me who can I run to?
Who can I cry to?
Who can I trust with my life if I have to?
Who can I give love to if I need to?
Who, who? (x3)

Tell me who can I run to
When my world is upside down
Tell me who can I cry to
When there is no one around.

Tell me who can I run to?
Who can I cry to?
Who can I trust with my life if I have to?
Who can I give love to if I need to?
Who, who? (x2)
