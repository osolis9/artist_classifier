Letter-to-my-son-Response-:Driicky Graham
Fuck it I just wanna see my father
Hard to turn the pages when you hardly see the author
And momma face is either bleedin' or it's marked up
You leavin' here in cop cuffs ain't how to teach a toddler
Two, raise a nigga, say my nigga, would I ever do
Why you couldn't stay my nigga? I was only two
And now I'm goin' through puberty
Everything with boobs and a booty lookin' cute to me
So as you can see, I treat girls like they ain't nothin', just a screw to me
Wasn't taught to use a "C"
O-N-D-O-M no birds and bees from him
I'm chasin' skirts ‘till the first dirty disease come in
Just need a minute. Depressed
Sixteen with a girl that want a belly finesse
With not a second to guess, I'm definitely stressed
Over her shoulder while she pissin' on a pregnancy test
But I ain't doin no dissin'
Pops I'm just wishin' that you would just listen
What happened to catch? Playin' pool or just fishin'
Havin' my back when these dudes set trippin'
Birthday candles, for you I'm wishin'
This news I mention is true non-fiction
I see what had the dude "Don" trippin
I was missin' you instead you got missin'
And my obvious attempt is not for me and you to make an argument of this
Let's talk about this shit
Acknowledge I exist
But you were never ‘round for me to talk about it with
I know this shit ain't even right bruh
Had my mother workin' hard just to get some diapers
Why you say you love her and you know you didn't like her?
Shouldn't have piped her if would wasn't gonna wife her
But you would say "But I do not regret my child! Stupid bitch I just wanna see my child!"
Dad you make me sick
You need watch your mouth
You talk about my moms and I'm headed to your house
You must be crazy if you think we gotta praise you
You be the same way if granddaddy didn't raise you
You ain't never heard the term that it takes two?
You ain't concerned ‘till it turns and I breaks you
And I don't care what the family say, I wish she hadn't messed with your ass anyway
And this is just my letter to you
If you was ‘round the I probably woulda read it to you
