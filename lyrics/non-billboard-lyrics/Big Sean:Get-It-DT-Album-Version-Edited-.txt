I'm tryin' stuff 'em 'til I can't fit anymore
I'm talkin' Donald Trump level
I'm tryin' to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle

All aboard screamin' 'oh'
The nigger go, go for the gold

Okay, B-I, B-I, bitches do it to death
If I come in with half bet I leave with the rest
Okay, you might be cool gettin' 50 percent
And I'm like, "What the fuck you doin'? I need Diddy percent"

Got a million on line one and another mill dialin' in
Momma on line 4 tellin' me how much not to spend
Ye on line 3 tellin' me how we about to win
You one ho' tryin' to get conferenced in

Boi, I just, I just gotta have it, imagine and make it happen
I prayed about it then grabbed it
My life is a fuckin' movie the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see who can get it the fastest

I'm sippin' on shh, older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm livin' life like I found a fuckin' check with no ink, I get it

I'm tryin' stuff 'em 'til I can't fit no more
I'm talkin' Donald Trump level
I'm tryin' to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle

All aboard screamin' 'oh'
Them niggers go, go for the gold, hey

Get it, get it, nigger, we can get it
Get it, get it, nigger, you can get it
Get it, get it, nigger, I can get it
Yeah, yeah, my nigger, we can get it

Let's roll, the sky never seemed so low
Lookin' at a life you never seen so close
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen

I'm back to dreamin' what you can't imagine
Talkin' cash shit, you got to fake the accent
I broke enough tree down that I can make a cabin, I turned all my Problems to ash, all my ones into halves and then divide it by half

Pass it on to my man, write my will out
Then pass it on to my fam' and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Bigs and greatest of all Seans

Sippin' on shh older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm livin' life like I found a fuckin' check with no ink, I get it

I'm tryin' stuff 'em 'til I can't fit no more
I'm talkin' Donald Trump level
I'm tryin' to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle

All aboard screamin' 'oh'
Them niggers go, go for the gold, hey

Get it, get it, nigger, we can get it
Get it, get it, nigger, you can get it
Get it, get it, nigger, I can get it
Yeah, yeah, my nigger, we can get it, let's go
