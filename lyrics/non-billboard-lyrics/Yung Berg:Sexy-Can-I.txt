Sexy-Can-I:Yung Berg
Sexy can I
Yeah, Yeahhh
All we wanna know is....

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I.
Sexy can I, hit it from the front,
then I hit it from the back.
know you like it like that.
then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
then we chill for a second, then were back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I.

[Young Berg:]
Lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin

Sexy can I, keep it on the low.
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo.
You can bring a friend, or you can ride solo.
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo.

When you sliding down the pole,

Then you climb back up the pole,
then you drop and do the splits.
How you make that pussy talk,
Baby damn, u is da shit
(Oh,ohh,ohh) Now look shawty, look shawty.
I make it rain in the club like (Oh,ohh,ohh)

Young Berg:

I don't care who's ya boy hittin, or who Ray's melon
When I give it to her, i know that she ain't tellin'
See i'm a go getta and she a go getta
You already know she...
(Sexy can I)
Sexy can I sing for you red-eye
Fresh out the pool no towel
just let it air dry.
And if you ain't fuckin' tonight
Man you can watch that tour bus go by

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (oh baby)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I.
Sexy can I, hit it from the front,
then I hit it from the back.

then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
then we chill for a second, then were back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners.
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I.
