How-Do-You-Feel:Akinyele
How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me?
Was she as good, goody, goody, good as can be?
And how do you feel knowing that I know?
And how do you feel 'cause I'm out the door?
And how do you feel knowing that I cheated on you too?

Now did she get you open with a 69
Doggystyle that's from the back and from behind
Now, did she do you well? Did she go down low?
Did she take it fast or did she take it slow?

See my guy he did me and he did me well
He kissed my lips, he touched my tits and then my panties fell
With some cherry jello and the cool whip cream
I could feel man dick go up inside of me

How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me?
Was she as good, goody, goody, good as can be?
Now how do you feel knowing that I know?
And how do you feel 'cause I'm out the door?
And how do you feel knowing that I cheated on you too?

Now did she get you open with a second round
On the bed, the chair or maybe on the ground?
Was it as good, as good as you thought it'd be?
Did the skinny amateur even compare to me?

Now when my guy got finished with his love and flow
He showed me many, many things that you didn't know
And by the time we reached, found 44
He took his time, laid me down and we made love some more

How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me?
I hope she was good, goody, goody, good as can be?
Now how do you feel if I ever told you?
'Cause if we had a camera we would have showed you
'Cause how good it felt, how good it felt when I cheated on you too

Ha, now I didn't even mean to cheat on your pussy
I found another lady who said, she'd fuck me for free
And I didn't even like have to eat her out
The first thing she put the dick up in her mouth

Now I'm not saying that I was loving the chick
I was a little astonished from the way she was sucking the dick
Don't get me wrong later on I'll probably be fucking the chick
Get on some Donald shit then start ducking the chick

Now the motherfucking moral of the story is
You cheat on me, I'll cheat on you that's just how it is
My new sweetie, she know I don't come speedy
Before she give me long head like Nefertiti

Now what we do with me and you don't go tell he or she
Keep it to yourself like Monica Lewinsky
So we don't blow trial or get caught up
When we're cheating in the night 'cause we hard up

Keep your guards up when you creeping through
'Cause all the bitches that cheat this song's for you
And all the niggas that cheat this song's for you
And everybody that cheats this song's for you, it goes

How do you feel now that you know you cheated on me?
I hope she was good, goody, goody, good as can be?
Now how do you feel if I ever told you?
'Cause if we had a camera we would have showed you
'Cause how good it felt, how good it felt when I cheated on you too

Don't trust no nigga or bitch that calls you the word, boo
'Cause they might be cheating on you, you

Don't trust no nigga or bitch that calls you the word, boo
'Cause they might be cheating on you, you

Don't trust no nigga or bitch that calls you the word, boo
'Cause they might be cheating on you, you

Don't trust no nigga or bitch that calls you the word, boo
'Cause they might be cheating on you
