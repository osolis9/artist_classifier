Modern culture with machines
Controlling minds and spirits.
Babylon is here again.
We are so busy electing electronics to forget our misery,
To transcend our past,
To serve this new God.
Where to find any peace ?
Where to ask for repentance ?
Even the angels are leaving the Heavens
For a better world.
Where to find a Lord
That is hiding
When we are asking for guidance ?
