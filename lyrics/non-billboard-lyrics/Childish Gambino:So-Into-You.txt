So-Into-You:Childish Gambino
With every passing moment,
thoughts of you run through my head
I am slowly realizing
I think you're truly heaven-sent
I think you're truly something special,
just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy
there's no one like you around
Oh I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
Really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
The way that you hold me
might be the things that you say
I don't know what it is boy
but I know I like feeling this way
I think you're truly something special
just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy
there's no one like you around
Ouh ah
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
Oh noo
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I am so into you
Really like (I really like) done to me
Oh I can't really explain it
I really like, what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
Really like, what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
So into you
