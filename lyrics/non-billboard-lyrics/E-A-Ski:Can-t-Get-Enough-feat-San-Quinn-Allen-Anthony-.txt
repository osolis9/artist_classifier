I Can't Ever Get Enough Of You
Well I know that I have only ever held your hand
But just one touch is more than enough to understand
There's a master plan
And although I know I don't believe in destiny
Maybe it found me
Now my world is filled with so many things
But nothing compares to the touch of your skin
There's a symphony
And a melody that plays whenever you're around
I think I've been found

I can see the sun
And I can feel the rain
I can hear the wind call your name
I can feel your love
But there's one thing I can't do
I can't ever get enough of you

Now I know that in the past I've been much too keen
But your eyes are the kindest that I've ever seen
I guess there are some things you just know
There's a voice inside telling me to hold on
And never let you go
There's a tune that plays
It's a sacred sound
It's a symphony I hear whenever you're around
Now my world is filled
With a whisper of love and a promise of tomorrow

I can see the sun
And I can feel the rain
I can hear the wind call your name
I can feel your love
But there's one thing I can't do
I can't ever get enough of you

When we make love I lose track of time
I can't count all the colors I see in your eyes
And while your heart beats in mine, it's true
I can't ever get enough of you

Now my world is filled with so many things
But nothing compares to the touch of your skin
There's a symphony
And a melody that plays whenever you're around
I think I've been found

I can see the sun
And I can feel the rain
I can hear the wind call your name
I can feel your love
But there's one thing I can't do
I can't ever get enough of you

I can see the sun
And I can feel the rain
I can hear the wind call your name
I can feel your love
But there's one thing I can't do
I can't ever get enough of you
