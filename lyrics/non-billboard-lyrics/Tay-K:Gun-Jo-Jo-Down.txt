Gun-Jo-Jo-Down:Tay-K
Pull up on his block we gon' gun him down
Posted up with the chopper, like who want it now
Run it up, run it up I need a hunnit thou
Catch him lackin', walkin' home, we gon' jump out
All the niggas they play pussy this a run down
And my niggas we gon' rock 'til the sun down
It was 12 o'clock at night we brought the guns out
Why these niggas wanna front now?
We was three deep, we had four poles
One these niggas gon' get lil jojo'd
Pull up on 'em with the sticks
Got three white bitches, they all want my dick
Leave that nigga R.I.P off the rip
Now we gang deep, we posted up in the ville (gang gang gang gang)
Codeine promethazine what I sip
And if she let me fuck the first night then she's a flip (a flipper)
Pull up on a nigga with the chopper let it rip (rrra rrra rrra)
Got a clip taped to a clip, run out and I'm gon' flip it
Leave a nigga dead in the street, a ricky
That's what these niggas get, for fuckin' with me
Youngest, hottest nigga in the fuckin' city
You still with your momma suckin' on that titty
You show me your bitch, now she fuckin' with me
You was in your feelings, I was in her kitty
I just bought a 30 shot a Glock, a glizzy
Nigga try to kill me then he comin' with me
