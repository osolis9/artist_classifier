Sweep-Da-Flo:Unk
She put her hands on her knees
And she drop it down low
She poked out her booty
And she made it sweep da flo

She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo

Damn, looky here looky here
Let me whisper somethin' in your ear
You the baddest thing up in here
My little playmate of the year

Get down [Incomprehensible] beer
Ye hoe don't have no fear
I wanna get with you my dear
Sweep the flo hoe wit yo rear

She sexy, exotic, bootylicious
She got it, I want it, how bout it
How much money in your wallet

Sweep da flo drop it down real low
Shake that ass 'till you can't no more
Make you work like a certified pro
Go baby, go baby go, low baby, low baby low
Sweep, sweep, sweep da flo

In this club on dro and shots of patron
One more day and we gone
Poke it all night, pop it all night
Get low bitch sweep the whole house
Yeah, you know what it is
Sweep da flo, let the freaks come out

She put her hands on her knees
And she drop it down low
She poked out her booty
And she made it sweep da flo

She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo

Shit, shit make some room
The bitch comin' through and I'mma call her broom
Sweep the flo till the shit gets swept
Shorty by herself she don't need no help

She hard and she'll run a pompoo off the yard
She whip, whip, whip, whip
On a face make a nigga say, yeah

Make good and ask for her number
I wonder if she wanna be my baby mamma
Got this nigga drunk
Jumpin' all money by the mother fucking trunk

She a badass yellow bitch
In the club every night doin' that nasty shit
If you wanna see her bend over and touch them toes
In the booty club where you need to go

You wanna see the bitch get nude
And pop that pussy with attitude
Put titties in your face like suck it
Then shake it on your dick like fuck it

Little mamma ain't scared
But you gotta be spinnin' that bread
Look, you gotta make it rain on the hoe
Then watch her scoop somebody off their toes

She put her hands on her knees
And she drop it down low
She poked out her booty
And she made it sweep da flo

She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
She sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
Sweep da flo, sweep, sweep da flo
