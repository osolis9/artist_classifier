Luxury-Flow:Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa & Ty Dolla $ign
[Intro]
1 AM, stone as night
Still blessed to have you here with me
Real shit, so I'm still kicking it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I do it better than most of these guys
Getting money is the joke to these guys
When you get my type of money, you don't notice them guys
Stay focused on the money or be broke when you die
Niggas know not to be stepping on my situation
You know the top is where I'm head it
I throw money like confetti
Hate the struggle, hate the grind at my nigga basement
Used to hate it on the nigga, cause your fake ass never made it
Real talk, I can’t quit
Hustle till I die, bitch I’m still getting higher than an elevator
Bye bitch, I'm everywhere the cash is
You ain't got no assets
You're a liability to loyalty, now back that
Try to get you niggas game, you had to make a check
But you won't survive if you treat me like your last connect
[Hook: Juicy J]
Luxury flows, I've got luxury flows
Thirty in my grip, that's a luxury roll
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, I've got luxury clothes
Gucci's on my ass, nine hunned for them hoe
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Imma roll me up a J and I'ma face it
Always been real, never had to fake it
If I call rapper meter she would take it
All up in her crib, I don't care bout who she digging
And I'm on the [???]
White people stare when I walk up to the plane
I got Gs, I got dough
I've got keys to the Rolls
I got KK by the O

[Hook: Juicy J]
Luxury flows, I've got luxury flows
Thirty it in my grip, that's a luxury roll
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, I've got luxury clothes
Gucci's on my ass, nine hunned for them hoe
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
