Block-Lockdown-Featuring-Ludacris-Infamous-:Funkmaster Flex
Yeah, Dirty South baby, Ludacris
Shout to Shaka Zulu, my man Shawn Taylor
It's goin' down

Yeah, Funk Flex, Volume Fo'
Disturbin' the peace, Def Jam South
'Cris, you ready?

Oh, it's my turn, aiight
I got permission to put ya mamma in a headlock
She tried to jook me in a figure-fo' leg lock
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock

Or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock
And it's on, so stop the sweatin' like a wristband
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
'Cuz I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon

We puttin' holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggaz with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yappin' is irrelevant

Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside
I'm a dentist makin' women open they mouth wide
You be in jail, still runnin' it on the outside
Thank not then, won't ya open up ya mouth right, but who cares?

I got my corner on lockdown
About to hold this whole block down
Ludacris tell 'em how the South sound
Uhh, Buddah-Laa, ah, uh, uh, uh, Buddah-Laa
Uhh, Buddah-Laa, ah, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh

I got my corner on lockdown

Ludacris tell 'em how the South sound
Uhh, Buddah-Laa, ah, uh, uh, uh, Buddah-Laa
Uhh, Buddah-Laa, ah, uh, oh, uh, oh, uh, oh

Comin' to Shady park is like a peep show
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missin' more than Shaq when shootin' free throws

They packin' and 'bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stoppin' cars like a roadblock
They movin' weight like Atlanta was movin' boat rock
And catchin' 'em's like seein' Muslims eatin' pork chops
Never happen and meanwhile I been thinkin', man
Niggaz been slangin' tapes like they slangin' 'caine

'Cuz in the hood, it's gettin' ugly like orangutang
So if you tryin' to stop the hustle, get the dangalang
Okay, we tryin' to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yellin' our fuckin' pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggaz, you think they dyked out, so don't play

I got my corner on lockdown
About to hold this whole block down

Disturbin' the peace, we do that funky shit
Hey, what can I say?  We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit

Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Aint nothin' nice, a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like, hold up

God damn, I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister, get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is tickin' me off like fifty metronome
I'm takin' all of ya money, just call me Pebbletone

Alright, I got the pistol and the safe key
You betta tell your bitch to follow you to safety
How dare you wanna be heroes and chase me?
It's Ludacris, won't leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?

I got my corner on lockdown
