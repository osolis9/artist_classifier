Walk right in, walk right in
Walk right in, walk right in
Walk right in, walk right in
Walk right in.
Still Speedin'.
I was telling everybody up your speed
That was a couple of years ago
And now I'm revving up for The Deliverance
Switching up gears got a couple of years to go
(Super Suave!)
Here we go
Soon as you hear that go!
Liverpool to Portsmouth
Yeah that got the crowd screaming
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
I got the people screaming
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
(Still Speedin')
Click click, hear the strap
Seatbelt, Derek's back
Time to blow like I'm Dynamo
No more disappearing act
I know you missed me, I missed you too
Sometimes that's what a mist will do
Like Taio I was cruising
Now it's time to take my steering back.
One of the best to ever do it
(They say!)
A testament to this game
(They say!)
And even in the wind I never blew it
(They say!)
I swayed but kept in my lane
They call me Fleetwood mac
I'm a with a mac with a fleet
Still getting royalties
No spoiler but I spoil me!
I got the crowd screaming
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
I got the people screaming
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Still speeding!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Ooooh oh, ooooh oh!
Make some noise!
Still Speedin'
See the way I'm riding
Cameras can flash
Pretty lady by my side
Lewis Hamilton of rap
(Swah Swah!)
Foot down, moving mammoth on the track
And I don't need no GPS
To see my manor on the map
Still representing my flag
And I've been all around the world, I've done laps
And I've got the whole crowd raising the roof
I'm Nigel Mansell, better take off hats
Stick to the flats, turn the bass up max
People in the rave better raise your hands
Let me hear you make some noise!
Take my love!
They tried to give me a ticket
But I ripped it like a raffle
Tell them people I am Mr Derek Safo
I am still speeding!
Pedal to the metal on a level I ain't gonna settle
For anything less than gold
I ain't gonna meddle around about
End up down and out
Tryna build since I was a little kid but never had the lego
Running through the fields and the meadows of Ally Pally
And now I'm on a hill
If Geppetto was able to make a fake boy real
I can definitely make a real boy hard as steel
I ain't gonna stop until I do a couple of million
I gave them my demo
Now it's time to do a deal again
I'm back up on the bill again
I'm fresh from the bank
Bob's your uncle, Mine's uncle Phil again
Because I've got the will power, and the potential
And I got the credentials, all of the essentials
When it gets stressful, my BP rises
But I'm never gonna stop
Unless I need to get petrol.
(Swah!)
Still Speedin'!
