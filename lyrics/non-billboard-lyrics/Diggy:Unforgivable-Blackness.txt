Unforgivable-Blackness:Diggy
[Verse 1:]
They wanna take away my black card cause I got a black card say I don't rap hard cause I don't act hard,
but if I act hard they would say that's odd and they would still hate I don't get that part.
I'm too boys to be one of the boys think I got a man servant with your pride of toy.
Why ya'll so salty? To much sodium soy.
Can ya brother and it's you that you only destroy, uh
Why should I apologize, for my father's wallet size?
Now they wanna get volent had my mother share the pain in Ms. Wallet's eyes?
Nah, we done came to far. Why my brothers gotta fight like Mufasa and Scar?
Get caught up in the system that they profiting off.
And they don't see none of the profits at all. Uhh.
[Chorus:]
Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs.
So why can't we get along?
My brother why are you questioning if I'm as black as you?
Uhh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my
My unforgivable blackness [x3]
Hey! Yeah!
[Verse 2:]
I can see Malcolm at the podium on the ground and Betty Shabazz holding him.
He tried to fight em but his wounds took a toll on him.
Dr. King too, man they got both of em.
The governments war for Petroleum in the streets try to take control of it every hood from Oakland to Magnolia.
Black men I don't know what came over us.
Stop the silliness my ____
I would never revenge my ____
And I don't spell it with an "er" I spell it with an "a" cause that is not what we are.
We were once kings till we got consumed by material things.

Womanizing all the women that material brings, it's sick it's powerful let's hear it again!
[Chorus:]
Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs.
So why can't we get along?
My brother why are you questioning if am as black as you?
Uhh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my
My unforgivable blackness [x3]
Hey! Yeah!
[Verse 3:]
You think you know, but you don't know the half of it.
I don't rap for the cash in it.
I do it cause I'm passionate.
It's my destiny I have to spit.
The real MC's I'm the last of it.
Uhh, I ain't down cause I ain't from the ghetto.
Camera liked the scar face, but I'll be all fellow.
I ain't from the projects, I'm more from the meadows.
We've both seen racism on the same level.
From Memphis to Zimbabwe ya'll got the same blood that's in my veins.
I ain't the enemy so why you in my face?
I ain't yo enemy so let's make peace.
[Chorus:]
Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs.
So why can't we get along?
My brother why are you questioning if I'm as black as you?
Uhh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my
My unforgivable blackness [x3]
Hey! Yeah!
