You-Bring-The-Freak-Out:Jermaine Dupri
You make me talk nasty, nasty to ya
Dream about how I wanna do ya
Think things to think about you bring it out
You show me how to use my tongue
You just so yum yum, tasty, tasty
Love it when you take me and take me
You bring the freak out in me

I'm freaky, freaky, gimme head, head
I wanna see how you get down, go down
Go down and get fed
Come and get some tasty tasty

Lick each and every individual part
And make me, make me, come come a chameleon
See a different position
To do something different to the yum yum

Jump, jump on top of the kitchen cabinet
So you can stick it and pump, pump
Miss Harris waiting for whatever I feel like having
Save you some embarrassment

I'm an Aries and I ain't scared of shit
Dare you to flinch then and there
I'll make your chest hairs lift

You make me talk nasty, nasty to ya
Dream about how I wanna do ya
Think things to think about you bring it out
You show me how to use my tongue
You just so yum yum, tasty, tasty
Love it when you take me and take me
You bring the freak out in me

Only you do ah, ah
Think about this and try, try
To kiss all the places
Missed by the basic loving up your guy

Ride in the park, in the broad daylight
Real hard like we the only ones around
Back of the car, tearing you apart
And this how shit be going down

When I pump, you say harder harder
Love it when I bring my camcorder
Whipped cream, take everything
Even when we first got started, started

From the bedroom to the dance floor
To a slow tune, up against the door
To the up and down, to the in and out
To the way you sound

You make me talk nasty, nasty to ya
Dream about how I wanna do ya
Think things to think about you bring it out
You show me how to use my tongue
You just so yum yum, tasty tasty
Love it when you take me and take me
You bring the freak out in me

Are you gonna fuck me?
You think I'm not?
Come on, baby, I'm coming
Let's fuck
I love it when you talk like that

Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait, go down there
Show me how to use my tongue
I want you to put your tongue right here
Talk to me, right there, on there, yeah

I'm a super freak, I do what you need
I'm a slave for you, stay craving you
I'm available, I'm unfadable
And I'm capable to disable you

I break you down, blow out your pipe
Turn out your lights and leave your wife
Lay me down on my back
But don't let my Timberlands clap
Hit it up like it's Wimbledon
Don't spare a racket 'cause Brat freaky like that

Just once taste of the nipple
And two kisses will leave you crippled
You done fell in love with Shantizzle
And I'ma keep you fiending for mizzo
The 6 0 6 4 fizzo
Got one of the freakiest hizzos

You make me talk nasty, nasty to ya
Dream about how I wanna do ya
Think things to think about you bring it out
You show me how to use my tongue
You just so yum yum, tasty, tasty
Love it when you take me and take me
You bring the freak out in me

You make me talk nasty, nasty to ya
Dream about how I wanna do ya
Think things to think about you bring it out
You show me how to use my tongue
You just so yum yum, tasty, tasty
Love it when you take me and take me
You bring the freak out in me
