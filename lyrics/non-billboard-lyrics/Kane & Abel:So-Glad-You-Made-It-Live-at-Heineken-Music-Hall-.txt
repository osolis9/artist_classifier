So-Glad-You-Made-It-Live-at-Heineken-Music-Hall-:Kane & Abel
Love come take me for a ride tonight
Take me all the way to the stars at night
Take me to heat with the speed of light
Take me to the arms of Vegas

Sweet like honey meltin' over me
Twenty-four seven so tempting
You're love is like a freight train running me down
So let it flow through me

Everything 's fine
In every way we'll make it
Tell me why my heart beats so fast
Like anyday you'll take it
Oooh.

Sweet little nothin' with your coco smile
Run right over me baby
Sugar 's got me tied up strangled for life
Don't want to pull over

Everything 's fine
In every way we'll make it
Tell me why my heart beats so fast
Like anyday you'll take it
Ooh well.

Sometimes you're oh so cruel
Sometimes you fake it
Love 's pumpin' trough my veins
And I'm so glad you made it

Yeah, yeah, I'm so glad you made it
(So glad you made it)

Oh come on now (6x)

Sometimes you're oh so cruel
Sometimes you fake it
But love 's pumpin' trough my veins
And I'm so glad you made it

Well I'm so glad. so glad.
So glad you made it
Well I'm so glad. so glad.
So glad you made it

Yeah, yeah, yeah (etc)
So glad you made it.
