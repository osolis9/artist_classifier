I-Love:Intoxicated
Some people say I'm crazy
'cos I love my baked beans
Some people say it's gonna make me sick some day
Well let me tell you baby
I'll never give up my baked beans
And if they ask me this is what I'm gonna have to say
(Chorus)
I love baked beans
Feels so good on my tongue
I love baked beans
If you wanna try
I know you wanna try
Come and have baked beans with me
I love to have it in the morning
when I rise from bed
And in the afternoon, yeah, that would be fine
In the evening and at night,
everything would seem so right
I love my baked beans, all the time
(Chorus)
