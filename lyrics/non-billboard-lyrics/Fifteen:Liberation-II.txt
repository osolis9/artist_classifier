Liberation-II:Fifteen
This is not another song about two dysfuntional people in love with each other.
And how it's just too bad they're so willing to abuse each other.
And gladly accept it from the other.
This is not a song about how it all came to an end.
And how I hope that you'll still be my friend.
Cause I don't.
And how we can't wait to get back together.
Cause it would only prove our cowardous so we must take in this thought deep.
We're all alone.
Cause there's five billion people in this world.
Maybe if you keep on trying...
You'll find the one that's just right.
I bet you'll make it through the night.
Maybe you'll find the one that's just right.
Your problems will end and you won't have to hide.
Once you've slept with everyone and it still doesn't work out, maybe you'll find the problem on the inside.
See this is a song about a boy and a girl.
Fell in love and ended the real world.
They had complementary platters from mom and dad.
But it wasn't a compromise at all.
It was perjury, it was injury, it was abuse.
It was life.
You know I have to agree it's great to say "I love you."
Maybe first we should find out what it means.
Cause there's five billion people in this world.
Maybe if you keep on trying...
You'll find the one that's just right.
I bet you'll make it through the night.
Maybe you'll find the one that's just right.
Your problems will end and you won't have to hide.
Once you've slept with everyone and it still doesn't work out, maybe you'll find the problem on the inside.
I've been scared of changing cause I've built my life around you.
Time makes you bolder, even children grow older.
And I'm getting older too.
Yea, I'm getting older too
