Cater-to-Your-Ego:Self
there's something in the water
someone breathing your air now
it will all have to wait
it's quite important that we tie you down and keep you there
- chorus -
she's all gone, shunned by everyone
if you wait too long, they'll cater to your ego
i believe in your head
all the answers are wrong

she didn't count on the backlash rejection
petty little juvenile crimes now
tell me who you startin' to date little girl
a boy or the world
maybe they dig pretention
maybe you dig taboo, now
it'll all have to wait
until we analyze the data when they're thru with you
- chorus -
she's all gone, shunned by everyone
if you wait too long, they'll cater to your ego
ms. know-it-all, it's hard to pick a side
will they break your fall or assasinate your tour guide
i believe in your head
all the the tension is gone
- chorus -
she's all gone, shunned by everyone
if you wait too long, they'll cater to your ego
i believe in your head
all the answers are wrong
