Good-Night:Roscoe Dash
How dey let me go and get a beat from Kane
I swear these 808s and snares make me go insane
Ay hold up baby girl I really wanna know your name
And let me be your Superman and you be Lois Lane

It's show time like cable, get up on that table
I love your sexy body and I know you love this paper
Bottles coming like they got legs on 'em
The way I killem man this beat will make 'em wanna call the feds on me

I'm orderin' a hundred shots of Patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get ya home
Girl you better give it up

And we gonna have a good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night

We gonna have a good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night

I got an open palm with cash in it
I could be up for MVP
I'm just tryna out do my last visit

Pocket's fat like they pregnant , and 'bout to have triplets
I got 20's flyin' send get ol' Benjy to adlib it
Hah, get it, I'm so far ahead of my time no c-section
Yo club we V.I.P. section

Party bus full of women, like weed next to me
Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin'
Line full of sexy ladies try'n' get with me
I'm just try'n' grand slam like the boy Ken Griffey
And I'm at the bar nine shots, no fifty
'Bout to bring a hundred more, e'rybody get tipsy

I'm orderin' a hundred shots of Patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get ya home
Girl you better give it up

And we gonna have a good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night

We gonna have a good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night

And we gonna have one hell of a time
Girl I'm feeling fine
You know what's on my mind
Give it up

This man in my swisher got me flyin'
This switch on got my mind
Your sexy little body got me stuck, so what's really good?

Girl I wish we really could do what we really should
I know your last boyfriend was only really good
Well I'm excellent, a sexual perfectionist
I creep up behind ya, deep inside ya, no exorcist

That's that extra shit, real long long extra thick
A different type of breed, a upgrade from that metric shit
It's time to make ya question all the rest ya messin' with
I'm try'n' tell ya I'm the one to hit the exit with

I'm orderin' a hundred shots of Patron
Girl you better get a cup
And once I get ya home
Girl you better give it up

And we gonna have a good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night

We gonna have a good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night
Good fuckin' night

And that's what I call a good fuckin' night

And, and we gonna have one hell of a time
Girl I'm feeling fine
You know what's on my mind
Give it up

This man in my swisher got me flyin'
This switch on got my mind
And your sexy little body got me stuck, so what's really good?
