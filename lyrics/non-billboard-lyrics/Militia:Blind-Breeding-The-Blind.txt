Blind-Breeding-The-Blind:Militia
condescending futile minds each another despondent waste in society
elimination an attempt to redefine a master plan altered by greed
a biased opionated sore on the faces of all a receding mental bore
a malignancy of such beyond a cure
a neverending circle
parallel in mind to end with time all seems so obsurd
destitution grim demise the faltering of a system forced to bleed
disintegration an elusive pacifier to blind to see the way they've bred society
i cant believe the life you teach
the words you preach
hypocrisy leading to your demise
corruption
fills your world of hate
for all who do not fall
exposing your warped mind of lies
