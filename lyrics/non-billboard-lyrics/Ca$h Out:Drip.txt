[Hook:]
Ye, wassup
She know my name
Ye, wassup
I run the game
Ye,
She know it's wet
It's soaking wet
I said it's soaking wet
Drip [x8]
Ye, she know my name
I run the game
I said I run the game

[Verse 1:]
Drip, drip I hover don't slip up
Girl I'm the janitor, hey let me mop you up
She like backup, but let me top you up
I'm like go hit, girl go and give me your hip
Spread your legs just like them jordans
And every time I come over
I gotta fuck you in my jordans
Gotta beat it up like it's important
Girl let me clear my schedule
Then fit you in my schedule
You on time just like it was scheduled
Girl prop it up, I mean arch your back
I'm going in, I let her smack, down
I grab her hips, she bend over
And make it drip

[Verse 2:]
Girl, fuck what's his name
He's irrelevant
Rollie on my wrist that why she call me the president
I leave evidence, seats wet
He mad, she's wet
And it come from thinking 'bout me
Put it all in you why would you doubt me
Put it all in girl you can't out me
Baby, what's my name Cash Out just shout me
She like me a little when a nigga say, cool
I like it when you do that, that's the move
LA reese it I got longevity
But what I'm stroking on you I'm going long that's longevity

[Verse 3:]
I get everything I want
These niggas know don't play with me
He better bust them bandz down
If he want longevity
Spore riding catching fist
Throw it back, slap it quick
Pull my hair talk that shit
Boy I like that gangsta' shit
You ain't never seen a puerto rican cheat like that
Like dis, like dis, like dis, like dis
I can't help it when I walk between
Got your nigga looking over here

You just think I'm stuck up
He Achilles sucker
Red bomb, caramel
