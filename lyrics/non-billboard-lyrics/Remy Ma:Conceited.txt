Conceited:Remy Ma
See this ain't nuttin' that you use to
Out of the ordinary and usual
You got to have the mind of state like I'm so great
Can't nobody do it like you do

Miraculous, phenomenal and
Ain't nobody in here stopping you
Show no love 'cus you whut's up
Look at ya self in the mirror like what da fuck

Damn I look good and can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah okay I got a little fat butt
My shorty tell me he like it like that
I'm happy

Another nigga never can't be
I'm so outstanding
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like brandy

See I look to good for this necklace
And I look to good to be wearing this
You know, I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look way to good to be driving that
And I look to good to be buying that
You know, I look way to good to be trying that
I'm conceited I got a reason

Now who's that peaking in my window
Nobody 'cus I live in a penthouse
Baby I'm sorry but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see

This kid that I'm waiting on
He said, he loves when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on

Now shorty trynna push up on me like a wonder bra
Listen when I speak out, I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one I don't need you
Ya name's Q, I only see you wen I see you

Listen two you neva play me
Why is that? Why is that?
'Cus I'm such a fuckin' lady
And three is all about me I don't want to talk about it
If you love to hear it here it go
Here you go, I wrote a song about it

See I look to good to be fuckin' you
And I look to good to be loving you
You know, I look way to good to stuck with you
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be gettin' with
And I look to good to be having kids
You know, I look way to good to be in da crib
I'm conceited I got a reason

I know what I'm doing
I can't stop my body done moving
I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music
He's watching me and he's 'bout to lose it

I'm droppin' that hotta den drop it like its hot
Face down ass up
I'm out of control wit it
Dip it low pick it up slow, poke it out now roll wit it

My thong showin' but it's cool my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See I look good and I'm knowin' it
But I was never to proud to be showin' it

See I look to good for this necklace
And I look to good to be wearing this
You know, I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look way to good to be driving that
And I look to good to be buying that
You know, I look way to good to be trying that
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be fuckin' you
And I look to good to be loving you
You know I look way to good to stuck with you
I'm conceited I got a reason

See I look to good to be gettin' with
And I look to be having kids
You know, I look way to good to be in da crib
I'm conceited I got a reason
