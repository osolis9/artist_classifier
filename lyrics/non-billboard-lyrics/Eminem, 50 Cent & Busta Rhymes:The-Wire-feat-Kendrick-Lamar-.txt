The-Wire-feat-Kendrick-Lamar-:Eminem, 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes
[Kendrick Lamar from Westside, Right On Time]
All praise go to the most high
All phase turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with the police guaranteed
Last nigga that did that died-- don't you, don't you, don't you
All praise go to the most high
All phase turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with the police guaranteed
Last nigga that did that died-- don't you, don't you, don't you

[50 Cent from If I Can't]
I apply pressure to pussies that stunting I pop
Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop nines
Tell niggas "Get they money right" cause I got mine
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone

[50 Cent]
I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go 'head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, ya heard me?
When streetlights come on niggas blast the nines
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's ups and downs so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
They ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma who always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the drop-out who made more more money than these teachers
Roofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it

[Eminem from There They Go]
Meat cleaver, leave a gas in a bitches ass
See her dreams of being an r&b; singer diva
Leave her face, cut her from the waist
Ah man what a waste, of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangsta
It ain't just new york or l.a. that pains no more
There's latin coun' kings here
Southside, four, east side and gansen
Nuthin but ganglands and, spray paint cans
And when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancing
That window rolls down and that tre-eight's dancing
And them shooters don't miss, homie they hate chancing
Straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashing
Red and blue lights, no ambulance, you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no detroit anthem
But just so ya know, if ya see them d-boys passing

Last nigga that did that died-- don't you, don't you, don't you
All praise go to the most high
All phase turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with the police guaranteed
Last nigga that did that died-- don't you, don't you, don't you
Wanna live where the AK, go for only 8k
Minus 6 racks, minus one on top of that
Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say
All praise go to the most high
All phase turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with the police guaranteed
Last nigga that did that died-- don't you, don't you, don't you
