Up-All-Nite:Nicki Minaj, Drake & Lil Wayne
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters

All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Man I love my team, man I love my team
I would die for them nigga

Drizzy say get her, I'mma get her
I got the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda. wait-wait fixate
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the peach state
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that: sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha)
Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

I mean, we don't even rock them shoes
If it ain't got a comma on the price tag
I mean but then again who looks at the price tag?
