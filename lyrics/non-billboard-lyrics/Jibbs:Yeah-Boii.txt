'Cause when a didn? t have much the haters love to talk mess
But Betta Yet, I stay flyer than a plane than a bird
Put my truck on 32? s and go it lookin' like it ain't a curb

I mean my words go back on words to that limit
Then I got gurls going crazy for the boii
'Cause I have no flurs all the guys say I'm silly
Because I cannot share I run my city like Diddy

So you can call me murna if you didn? t see me cumin'
You can hear me for you see me 'cause my Lamborghini's humin'
Got the Hummer behind me and the beats just bumpin'
Bangin' the concrete and gotach A-Town Stompin'

A yo I represent that south S T L O U I S, man
Where the love to rock them fitted caps and them headbands
My Loui Gurls dressed in all white like it? s a wedding
And Pookie man standing right by my side in black like he the Best Man

Where reflections off the wall that make ya think ya seeing things
And the trunk just thundering got everybody rumbling
The truck sitting so high that chu could see up under it
