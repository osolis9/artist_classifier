Piece-of-Joy:Ayo & Teo
You never know what you have until it's gone
Never learn to appreciate until you lose one
How can she ever love someone again
If she lost all the love for herself back then
And how can you put your faith in her
Knowing that you'll never get love in return
In return...

What can I do, what can I say to make you happy again
What can I sing, what can I bring to make you smile
What does it take for me to take these clouds away from you
Maybe I can give you a piece of my joy

Seems like she'll never learn nor realize
Those that chose to burn their hands will have to pay a price
And it's not for the money and it won't be all these lies
The worst crime she'll committ to you can be the waste of her life
I don't hope so but look at her
And you know so...

What can I do, what can I say to make you happy again
What can I sing, what can I bring to make you smile
What does it take for me to take these could away from you
Maybe I can give you a piece of my joy
