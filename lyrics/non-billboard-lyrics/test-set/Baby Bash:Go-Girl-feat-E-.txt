Excuse me miss, what's your name

Drop, drop it low, make, make it pop,

(Baby Bash) Go girl, uh, a show girl, uh, go-getter, for cheddar,
Denero, dope girl, a money on the dance floor
Getting low girl, uh, a trow girl,
With game that'll make my toes curl
Cause she's a beast in the bed and I'ma beast with her
Beat it up like a champ and uh she re-twitter
Bash be going hard, it's the headline news
She rocking the fresh js, stilettos, the Jimmy Chu's

Black white and yellow bone, watchin' what they jelly on
Bringing major fedy home oo what's poppin
We hit em with the honey tone
Bringing daddy money home
Got me ridin candy chrome
What that do

Shoppin for a new pair
Stuntin on you boppers
In the DJ booth
Giggin with some punk rockers
She my runnin back, player
I'm the quarterback
Send her down to Meh-hico
She brining me the border back

Excuse me miss, what's your name
I don't wanna tell you the same ol' thing
Drop, drop it low, make, make it pop,
I can do this all night shorty
I don't wanna stop

Guh, go girl, go, go, go, go, go

(E-40) Uggh, she over there hittin it
She getting it,
Grittin it, grindin it, grippin it
Poppin, lockin, droppin and dippin it
Pickin it up and lickin it
Never missin a beat or skippin
She know that the fixtures diggin it

Look at her go, she kill it,
Bad ass boots
Big ass caboose
I'm tryin to get her drunk
Take her to the telian goose
Spark a fat ass blunt
Put a talend in her
Unplug the smoke detector
Get my head off and then eject her

Imma macaroni man
I don't think you understand
I don't pay for pussy when
Pussy pay me man
Steady stackin hustler man
All about my rubber band
Real nigga haven't changed about money

Gotta keep my paper right
The brainwasher up all night
Picture this flow, she getting my dough
She bought a brand new bike
Letting em know, used to be proud
I don't care she dike
Baby can go, put on a show, she do what I like

Excuse me miss, what's your name

Drop, drop it low, make, make it pop,
