Slippin-Again:DMX
[Intro]
It’s what it is baby, straight biz baby
We ain’t kids baby
We get down like that
It’s what it is baby, straight biz baby
We ain’t kids baby
We get down like that

[Hook]
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling,

[Verse]
More money, more problems
I thought more money would solve them
I spent more money in Harlem
That Frank Lucas did before the boys dropped
Now shit done changed
I don’t feel it, shit look strange!
I realized shit ain’t the same
At the end of the day, shit ain’t the game
Nigga go and do it, best slip and fell
Went to the hood, took a trip to hell
Deal when I should, swore my shit sell
Orange knew I could, so I did well

[Hook]
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling,

[Verse]
If y’all only knew what my life was like
And what I’m going through
Maybe you’d think before you talk,
You gotta crawl before you walk
Think having money is the answer
Money ain’t nothing but another form of cancer
Or you can do is watch me die
You don’t wanna watch me try
So watch me fly!
But you gonna do is watch me fly
Do my thing from that big stage in the sky
Lord, please, hold me down!
Cause now everybody wanna know me now

[Hook]
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling,

[Verse]
Please help me! Which way do I go?
Life gives a fuck which face do I show
Cause I know, can’t show them all
Even though I slipped and fell I won’t fall
Get it? Ok you don’t some of y’all will
But most of y’all won’t
I’ma keep living life being a man that got bang and
I know only he can save me!

[Hook x2]
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord where I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling, slipping and falling
Slipping and falling,
This time it got a nigga calling
Up to the lord I’m crawling
All my nigga getting tired of
Slipping and falling,

[Outro]
I wish you knew, I wish you fucking knew
I won’t fall, I don’t wanna fall
I wish, aha.
