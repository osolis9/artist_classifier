Betcha don't know what's goin' on

Betcha don't know what's goin' on, no

It's on now, New Year, pop the pain
Sun blaze through the gray cloud, stop the rain
Shear shirts by Chanel, baby, feel the breeze
Drop top, me and shorty, while she be at my knees

Let the wind blow, low fade, peep the glow
Know my style from the foul days, keep it low
Got new plans, worldwide, livin' the life
Any chick I make wife gon' shiver tonight

Know the game, it's ups and downs learnin' the ropes
Twenty-six years of age, just learnin' to cope
Came a long way but still got so far to go
So by now, I guess you know
(Talk to me)

Betcha don't know what's goin' on
(Yeah)
If you don't know, we're gonna show you
(AZ)
Betcha don't know what's goin' on
(Come on)
If you don't know, we're gonna show you

What if we all had minds alike? Thought the same
Only few was taught to get this, divorce the game
Visualized as a young cat, saw the dream
Get large, shit hard, and assorted cream

So many came that I saw and went wise on my ways
Made livin' for me more intense, divided my days
Weekends, party nights, raffled the stakes
Love sophisticated women, those that rather you wait

Tipped it off from the finest juice to 90 proof
Rocked it all, from designer suits to climbin' boots
All in the summertime, workin' the courts
Lookin' mommy wit them thick legs, hurtin' them shorts

So many ladies in the world today searchin' for mates
Got these non-players perpin' for dates, hold up
Give me love if you've got it in ya, hot as Virginia
Hot enough for me to slide this up in ya

Betcha don't know what's goin' on
(Yeah)
If you don't know, we're gonna show you
(Feel me)
Betcha don't know what's goin' on
(Come on)
If you don't know, we're gonna show you, ooh
(You heard?)

Got the solar, Nat King Cole in his prime
So behold that, shoes unfold in each rhyme
Move accordin' like the chosen ones roamin' the earth
Gettin head until I'm dead, decompose in the dirt

Play the same spot, bitch cast, lost it all
Rollin' dice and G you're better, now you forced to ball
Havin' fun at the main event, toastin' cups
Quarter pieces tryin to get yours roastin' up

Play the game if you got toys to match your words
You a vet, throw your net, nigga, catch some birds
Only a few left, still sincere, spread love
Thank God, it's a heaven above
(Talk to me)

Betcha don't know what's goin' on
(Yeah)
If you don't know, we're gonna show you
(Uh huh)
Betcha don't know what's goin' on
(You heard?)
If you don't know, we're gonna show you

Betcha don't know what's goin' on
(Brooklyn)
If you don't know, we're gonna show you
(You heard?)
Betcha don't know what's goin' on
If you don't know, we're gonna show you
(So sad)

Betcha don't know what's goin' on
If you don't know, we're gonna show you
Betcha don't know what's goin' on
If you don't know, we're gonna show you

Betcha don't know what's goin' on
If you don't know, we're gonna show you
Betcha don't know what's goin' on
