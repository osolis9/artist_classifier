M-V-P-:Big L
A yo spark up the Phillies and pass the stout
Making quick money grip before your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend? Aight then

L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolet
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way

Yeah, 'cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomer-rings
No matter how far I throw them, they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C.
I'm down with diggin' in the crates and I'm M.V.P.

If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C.
If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C.

Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on their mix tapes
And once again the man's back with a denged track
So here's your chance jack to get loose and let your hand clap

I got juice like voco, mad crues I broke through
Niggas be getting mad 'cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And every time I'm in a jam I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol

And my raps is unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying porches
I'm coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Carpi, I'm M.V.P.

If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C.
If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.

Battles I lose, none I make crues run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
My run is like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly and take your Pelle Pelle

I'm the neighborhood lampor, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk
Boxers in your mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey

And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C.
Raps my J O B, and I'm M.V.P.

If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C.
If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C.

If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C.
If rap was a game, I'll be M.V.P.
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C., yeah
