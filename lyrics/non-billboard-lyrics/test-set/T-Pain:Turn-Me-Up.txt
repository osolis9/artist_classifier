Turn-Me-Up:T-Pain
[Intro:]
Turn me up...
Turn me Down...
Heyy...

[Verse 1:]
I'm so used to your face, I don't want no body else
Wish this wasn't the case, but I just can't help myself
When you sound so good, turn you down I wish I could
Make you frown, I never would
You can break me down until I turn off.
You got me spinin' on my head break dancin'
You can tell by the way you got me standin' upside down
Baby here we go, see it fast hear it slow I'm a show you what it's hittin for
I'm your stereo

[Chorus:]
Please turn me up
Cause I'm burnin' up, and if I listen good I can learn enough
And boy I really wanna show you how, I became the best around
Please don't turn me down
Get it boy uh uh
Show me what I'm reachin for uh uh
Everybody hit the floor uh uh
You got me so stuck
Please turn me up

[Verse 2:]
I'm your stereo
Please turn me up
Cause I'm burnin' up, and if I listen good I can learn enough
And boy I really wanna show you how, I became the best around
Please don't turn me down
Get it boy uh uh
Show me what I'm reachin for uh uh
Everybody hit the floor uh uh
You got me so stuck
Please turn me up

I'm your stereo
Please turn me up
Cause I'm burnin' up, and if I listen good I can learn enough
And boy I really wanna show you how, I became the best around
Please don't turn me down
Get it boy uh uh
Show me what I'm reachin for uh uh
Everybody hit the floor uh uh
You got me so stuck
Please turn me up
