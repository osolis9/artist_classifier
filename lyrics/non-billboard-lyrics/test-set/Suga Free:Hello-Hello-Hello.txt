Hello-Hello-Hello:Suga Free
Uh oh, sucka-ducka (patron'), came out the cut again

So let's take a trip, & put a dip in yo hip
And let me tell you what they don't want you to knoww
I like to fuck em when they boring only fuck em if they need it
And you see what I'm talkin bout

And when you feel the pimpin in yo body don't you ever tell nobody
They gon think you crazyyy
So lace your gators up fast, kick her in her ass
No ifs, ands, buts or maybes

I'm as crafty as some paper leave her snot but I promised butter
Take a loss & break em off & tell her that I don't love her
Sucka ducka patron', I see em coming
From a long way doin shit the wrong way

Cause I respect the pedigree & I know I'm in

Jump to it, don't share & get the hell out my face
I'm a king on a throne still learning the game
That's why all ya'll playa hatas know my name

Suga don't take no mess!, I'm a playa
From the blood to the bone & flesh, all the way down
To a nigga DNA, I love my pimp patnas
And I love the way they play, I like to see my niggas

Hit the evening news with a cold-ass bitch
Next day bailin out doin the same ol shit
When I had nothin a hoe starts payin me
Like bam ba bam bombom booyah baby!
