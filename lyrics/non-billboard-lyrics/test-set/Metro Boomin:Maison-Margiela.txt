Maison-Margiela:Metro Boomin
1500 on some Maison Margielas
Freeband Gang, we the new Roc-A-Fellas
You started making million now they think you worship the devil
We keep it pimpin give a bitch to my brother
So used struggle when you come from the gutta (Whoop)
I love to grind cause these stones of rosetta
You keep it silent and they think you the devil (Yeah Yeah)
25 thousand on a Cashmere sweater

We go to Magic and we changing the weather
Sleep with the choppa, I got all on my bezzles (Ni Ni Nigga)
A cool billion when you see us together (Whoop Whoop)
I'm still standing in designer forever (Freeband Gang)
I went to Mexico and fucked up some change (Whoo Whoop)
That shit ain't nothing to me, I fucked up the game (Turn Up, Turn Up)
They got my finger prints it's no one to blame (Ay Fuck 'Em)
My family depend on me, I'm slanging cocaine (I swear)
I called the plug and I went straight to the pot (I swear)
I did a dounut when I turned out the lot (Skirt!)
I'm in Margielas that ain't know that I rock
I'm blowing money, and I'm never gone stop (Future)

I'm Kareem, Jay and Dash (Yeah)
Put them altogether (Whoop)
I'm Larry Bird, Kobe and MJ (Yeah)
I'ma ball forever (Ball)
And the way a nigga hustle, it's like I got a vendetta (Yeah Yeah)
It's so many shooters in my circle (What)
They ready to get creamed
Bitch, I'd a let it slide off
I got Baking Soda (Baking Soda)
You used to let us ride off
And then shoot up a house
I burnt the tires off this whip, I'm at the gate letting it snart
But I need diamonds on my wrist
So I need to be swagging them out
Ain't enough amount of money to make me change where I'm from
I take a half a fucking pound and put it right in my lungs
I'm moving on in nothing but Louie Vuiton, sippin that main train.
Like it's Dom Perignon, Future
