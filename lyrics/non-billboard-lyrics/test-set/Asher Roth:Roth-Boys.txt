Roth-Boys:Asher Roth
[Cannon:]
You're about to witness a dynasty like no other (and the winner is...)*
This is history in the making (and the winner is... Ash Roth, ya'll, my man)

The Roth boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling nice
If you only live once and there's only one life
Then tonight might as well be the night.

Sorry, forgot to introduce myself, I go by the great Don Cannon

The Roth boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling nice
If you only live once and there's only one life
Then tonight might as well be the night.

White boy on the beat,
How surreal is that?
I mean for real he's the illest
I hate to kill the cat
But I am curious, and they deserve this shit
So in flurries, I hit em with the furry fists
Fists of furry yo it's very yo I murder this
They star gazing like capurincus
Verdict is:
Not guilty spit game so filthy
Cow girls all wanna milk me
Will be
Pissed if he knew all the chicks that I hit,
Chicks meaning tracks, are you sick?
Pigheaded, demented
Ya the seamen and freemen
Need to be at least a ten to get in
You're entering, the lions den
Let it begin may the best man win
They passed on me from Pittsburg Slim
But in the end I am kickin' it with steve riffkin (yo what up)
Enough said
Well except... "hey, yo, steve, do you have enough bread? " (yo you good?)
Lechiam
That's more like it
But what do I know? I'm just a white kid
And that's Langley,
He my side kick
The girls cheer when we here yeah, they high kick
And if it's ball, I'd be Kirk Heinrich
JHawk beats like it's my shit (my shot)
Shot clock, non stop, put it in they eye socket
This is routine like an outfield high pop
I eat my breakfast at IHOP
Scotch on the rocks
Look at me with they eyes cocked
Gosh this is nuts!
Ain't nothin IHOP's seen in a while
This is wild
Even I'm shocked
So damn good didn't know that I could
Feel a rick flare comin on
Can I hear it?
WHOOO

The nature boy in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling nice
You ain't even gotta bring your boyfriend out
It's the party of the year
We dancin on the couch (we on the couch)
Let your hair down baby let it go
Figga with jigga figga da jiggamo
Figga jigga bit her cause he didn't know
But when has a jigga decision ever gone gold? (I dunno man)
Let the trumpets blow
Low and behold for those who don't know

Ash Roth in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling nice
You ain't even gotta bring you boyfriend out
We can turn the lights off and play who's in your mouth (whos in ya mouth?)
Better beat since I moved down south
To the A add an S and an H and we out
(we in the south)
Yeah we bounce
Laughing, like yes, that just happened
Now that's what I call rapping

You half ass pass wheres your hallway pass?
You ain't allowed out get back to class!
I'm kickin ass and taking names
This is the same thing that happend on Renegade
I came here to entertain
Cause I ain't never affraid
Say on anything
Oh, I'm a be getting paid
Obama for president, in two thousand and eight, eight

The Roth boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling nice
If you only live once and there's only one life
Then tonight might as well be the night (man)
It might as well be the night
It might as well be the night
It might as well be to-night

Aight that's it
I hate when rappers rap for like 5 minutes
I just, have an attention span of zero
So bring those horns in and let this whole celebration
Mellow out, and we'll take it to the next chapter

Hottest verse of two thousand thousand
How long is that?
Rapper of the year, rapper of the decade, and I anit even a rapper
