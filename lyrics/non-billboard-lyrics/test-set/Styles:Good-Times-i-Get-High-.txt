Styles
A Gangster And A Gentleman
Good Times (i Get High)
I Get High, I Get High
I Get High, I Get High
I Get High, I Get High
I Get High on your memories
High on your memories
High on your memories

I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
Highhhh (In background thoughout song)

[Verse One- Styles]
Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.: the only flow'er that you know with a bounce in a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get, high cuz I'm in the hood, the guns in around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now
And I'd rather roll somethin up
Cuz if I'm sober dogg, I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin up
I get high as a kite
I'm in the zone all alone, muthafucka 'case I'm dyin tonight
So I roll em up back to back, fat as I could
You got beef with Styles P, I come to slide to the hood

[Chorus]
I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high  (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
I Get High, high, high, high
Highhhh

[Verse Two- Styles]
Ayo, I smoke like a chim-in-ney
Matta fact I, smoke like a gun
When a killa see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did
Add to that, that I smoke like the Hippies did back in the 70's
Spit with the finishing touch
Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand
Like the M-5 pedal when its touchin the floor
I get high cuz fuck it, what's better to do
And I'ma neva give a fuck cuz I'm better than you

[Chorus]

[Verse Three- Styles]
I'ma smoke til my lungs collapse
I'm from a era where 
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dolla bill is powerful
I smoke weed cuz time seem precious, and I know what a hour do
High for a livin, gots ta ride for a livin
Wit my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin
Shit I get as high as I could
Cuz if you see things like I see things
Cuz I'ma die in the hood
Muthafucka understand its full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it aint purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die
This is S.P. dump it in, you bitch I get high

[Chorus Til Fade]
