First-Love:Bandit Gang Marco
Damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way
So many broken pieces wish you were to stay
God damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way?
So many broken pieces, damn I wanted you to stay
Oh no, oh no,
You know, I was young, hate to say I was dumb
She was my first love

It was the first time, now I feel like the blame's on me
Damn I miss my baby
Now I lay your tales on me, on me
Damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way
So many broken pieces wish you were to stay
God damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way?
So many broken pieces, damn I wanted you to stay
I thought you would be my hero
Thought you'd be my savior
What we had was so special
Will we meet again later?
When I gave you my heart, I looked in your eyes
Told you hold it tight and wish you replied
You told me you love me, all those beautiful lies
All the tears a shame, you never apologize, never apologize

Damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way
So many broken pieces wish you were to stay
God damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way?
So many broken pieces, damn I wanted you to stay
Oh no, oh no,

Calling on cupid, cause I've been so stupid, fucking with groupies
Now I'm bout to loose it, I tried giving you chances
My failure outstanding, give me one more chance and
To be your man and I heard this before
Baby let's just take a ride and she said no
Baby I'll be by your side, and she said no
Baby I'm about to cry, my heart so broke
It's like it's dead inside, yeah
That's the end of that fairy tale, no more going down that road
And you know it very well, I'll be better by myself
Cause I know I'm independent

Damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way
So many broken pieces wish you were to stay
God damn I miss my first love, how we end up this way?
So many broken pieces, damn I wanted you to stay
Oh no, oh no.
