As-the-World-Turns-feat-Cuban-Link-Prospect-Triple-Seis-Tony-Sunshine-:Terror Squad
Yo no lies
When I was five I arrived in America
Made it alive survived the hell of a trip kid I'm telling ya
Sellin' the freedom town to put my feet on the ground
See whats around, then lock shit down like Nino Brown

I'm bound by hona and down for drama like Tony Man Tana
Y'all clowns don't wanna fuck around pana
Puffin pounds of marijuana wit my entourage
Camouflage in the silent fog getting charged so we'll party dark

Terror Squad my car-tel, we larger, it ain't hard to tell
We more cream then Carvel
For real pockets filled, 1 hundred dollar bills
Probably with the squattin' villains
Knowledge while we holla at the college girls

This how it feels to be on top of the world
Up in the pearl white drop just cruisin' the burrows
Keepin' it through from the beginning to end do for yourself
Ain't no friends in this envious world we livin' in

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo there's only 1 life to live of many ways of livin'
And many crazy feelin' is they see their money so high grazin' cellin'
My heart is so warm but they get cold at times
I might let you know from my oldest rhymes

I poll for shine, hold the nines
When I'm livin' in the streets till we make it and take it
They nuttin' giving 'cuz it ain't sweet, how you think I got nasty?
Fuckin' with older niggas tryin' to pass me
But couldn't out last me

It was a run in a race so disrespect
Will take this gun in your face so I can put my son in your place
Now we can get by and form an ill duo we'll fuck you though
'Cuz I'm the boss like Hugo

You know the name black
My grown-nal bent, turned around and came back
I used to sling crack now I lay back and just play tracks
Make a haystack to get my fam better livin' and never givin' up
You can tell by this letter written

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Yo, yo, yo, I feel like my life in is trouble
Glossy eyes off the lie tryin' to stride to survive the struggle
I can't sleep, yo they cover us deep
Tryin' to puzzle how to smuggle my fam like antiques

Been on the hottest corners in the bronx for weeks
Do I trust you? Do you want this as bad as me?
Do I buss you or let love become my tragedy?
Always swore before I dropped I was goin' shoulder to the top

Everything I got I'm goin' to bring it back to the block
Took a chance, stepped it up a notch in advance
Made the people dance now it's time to really enhance
All the horror it's true you ain't even promise tomorrow

The bullet ripped through his starter, he blew it don't even bother
My main man, me and him had the same plans
Took the same tames, I wrote the rhymes while he weighed grams
Made me understand see the world revolve in the palm of my hand

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals

Aiyyo as the world turns from life we learn
The more money you earn, the more money to burn
Make the sum, 'cuz everything that glitters ain't gold
Get on the road to riches, fulfill all your wishes and goals
