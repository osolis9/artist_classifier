Candle-Light-Champagne:Mercedes
Ain't nothin' wrong with some candlelight
Some chilled champagne and you tonight
All I want to do is make you ohh and ahh
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop

Ain't nothin' wrong with some candlelight
Some chilled champagne and you tonight
All I want to do is make you ohh and ahh
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop

I know you wanna see me in my negligee
So I'll peel my clothes off slowly
You know that I'm ready to play
It's starting to get hot in here

Maybe it's just me, baby
Touch me and see, baby
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Right there

You know I'm ready so you better get ready
Ohh, yah, ohh, ohh, all right
Ohh, ohh, wee
Welcome to your freakiest fantasy

Ain't nothin' wrong with some candlelight
Some chilled champagne and you tonight
All I want to do is make you ohh and ahh
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop

Ohh, don't stop
