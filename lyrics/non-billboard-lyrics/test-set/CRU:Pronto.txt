Pronto:CRU
Tonight, tonight the rhythm blunt is gonna rip the mic
  (Smoke blunts all night long)
Baby, all night long
Daylight, daylight you still be
Rockin' with the rhythm blunt CRU
And we'll rock on and on and on and on

Mic check, 1 to get ready, hon
Peace to the rhythm blunt CRU packin' guns
And give me some funk that's wild and poundin'
And I'll get nastier than Florida Evens doo-doo brownin'

Astoundin' gives the peace up like Jimmy Snooker
And have ya head bobbin' like a hoods point hooker
I'm in there like swim wear, oh yeah, no diggi
And when i shoot my rose
You'd think my name was [Incomprehensible]

Zunga zung, zunga zunga zeng
And my favorite jams Method Man by Wu-Tang
Comin' funkadelik 'cuz I grooves that's my nation
When I grabs the mic I gets the sensation

Flip the script like a angry actor, shake or poke ya
I'll wet ya with my supa-soaka
'Cuz when I display my strong flow
I gotcha in a sleepa life [Incomprehensible] strong bow

Pass the piece of steel to the one Chadio
And let me crush it with a new style few pile pieces and bits
Into hits like this here shit
So calm down, clown when I come around
I'm not happy slappy, walkin' town with a frown

Get down, get down with the rhythm runnin' to your ear
And peep out the sound from here to Zaire
If this don't work, things get steep and deep
I'm runnin' in the streets and I'm playin' for keeps

For now I crack heads, but don't mistake me for a white rock
Keep my jail ceasar, instead of a nasty tight lock
Dread get me fed end up dead 'Cuz I'm psycho
Choppin' you down is the route that I might go
And that goes for all my enemies and my foes, pronto, pronto

Pronto, nigga, gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers

Pronto, nigga, gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers

Pronto, nigga, gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers

Pronto, nigga, gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers

In LIP this is how we be
Snappin' necks, stashin' checks and next on the pussy
Neva with tha hoes 'cuz the hoes is screamin' rape
Buff my nut while I beep on my kalima harmet tapes

Done, now I'm walkin' through her crib in my undies
Honie in the back room screamin' roll bundi
'Cuz when I knock da boots, the horror, the horror
I'm orphan Annie, hon', see ya tomorrow, tomorrow

Time to pick up Chad, Ha and some ism, damn
Oh no, I'm kinda low
Go to Willis Avenue and tell Jamaican J
I'd gladly pay him Tuesday for a bag of boom today

You got the boom, it's over
I'm behind the wheel so Cha's the designated roller
Cha pass to chad pass to the Y O G
We takin' part of this to Dr. Dre on Sista B

It's like that, yo, like that, yo
And if you ask what's in your mouth, it's my fat ballz
Yo, crazy legit the ill shit's necessary
To make you dance ya ass off like Fred "Rerun" Berry
Very much a love bug like Herbie
I got crazy game, kerbie, kerbie

You got crazy game and I got crazy gats
And we slam like a batterin' ram so, nigga, step back
It's the one and only, only one that leaves niggas strung
By the flip of a lip, by the flung of a tongue

Couldn't care less if the world blew up
But I wanna blow up before it blows
Through flows of persistence which make a difference
In my everyday existence 'causin' me to go the long distance

But back to a simple style and type format
As I stomp on comp just like a doormat
This type stuff's under lock and key
Chad is a ruff as ruff can be

Now how ruff can that be? Well, let's go figa
Ruffa than son of Sam with a slam trigga
Ruffa than a criminal, takin' a liquor swigga
Ruffa than the voice on that Kid Lord Jigga
So toodaloo, ta-ta, cheerio, this here shit is type Pronto

Pronto, nigga, gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers

Pronto, nigga, gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers

Pronto, nigga, gimme yours
All a bitch could do for me is
Eat dick and drop her drawers
