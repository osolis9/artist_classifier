[Missy]
There's a party
I'm up in the club and I'm drinking I'm drunk off the Alize
As I hear the record spins it seems to take over me
So I move side to side an it's something inside that controls me
As I walk to the D.J and I say

[1] -  Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy it's gon' be for you and me, you see

[2] -  Mr. D.J., spin it one more time
We gonna play it back to back, we gon' rock it two times
Move your feet with me, move your hands with me
See how easy its gon' be for you..

[Missy]
You say your a baller
Cause you up in the club, fakin like you got dough, with your dollars
To my peoples with me money let me hear you holler
We're gonna party like no other party, don't stop til the morning
but before I go this is what I say

[Chorus]
[Repeat 1, then 2]
