Novacane:Lil Wayne
Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Uh, ooh, girl, I love you so
Good Lord Almighty, I'm in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I'd call her when I need her
And she'd give me good love 'til my nose start bleedin'

Life is just like movin' mountains
And when I can't cope I'm hittin' that slope
That great white hope and there ain't no pressure
I can't feel nothin' but I never felt better

Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin' me softly, that girl is poison, huh
I had to let you go, take things slow
But just so you know

I'll do it all again if I have the chance
Don't feel the pain
(Don't feel the pain)
Like novacane
(Like novacane)

I'll take the whole world on, I'm feelin' so strong
Don't feel the pain
(Don't feel the pain)
Like novacane
(Like novacane)
Like novacane

You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the world
I'm sorry that I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the Doctor preferred

My friends told me leave you alone
And I just told 'em leave me alone
It's sad, our thing had to end
Our relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long

And I see her in the streets but I can't bring her home
Man, I was on her line all day, no phone
Huh, no Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana
And truth is

I'll do it all again if I have the chance
Don't feel the pain
(Don't feel the pain)
Like novacane
(Like novacane)

I'll take the whole world on, I'm feelin' so strong
Don't feel the pain
(Don't feel the pain)
Like novacane
(Like novacane)

Uh, sweet sugar hill
Yeah, I used to climb her
I never imagined she turned out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned sour

She gave me power, the world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flower
But I had to change, yeah, I had to change
So I left her for a bitch named Mary Jane

Now everythang is cool, everythang is fine
Girl, I'm movin' on I done left you behind
But every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time 'cause

I'll do it all again if I have the chance
Don't feel the pain
(Don't feel the pain)
Like novacane
(Like novacane)

I'll take the whole world on, I'm feelin' so strong
Don't feel the pain
(I don't feel the pain)
