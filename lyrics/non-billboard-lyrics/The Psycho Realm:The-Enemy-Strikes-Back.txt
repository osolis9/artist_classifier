The-Enemy-Strikes-Back:The Psycho Realm
The streets are packed with scenes of flash and guns clash
The enemy strikes our camp the fuck back
React like man of action
Bringing them a counter attack in sick fashion
End of the road, my friend
Look alive and you'll be one of the soldiers we'll send
In, to the war were fighting
With the laws kingpins and we run till we win
Rebel bases are scattered, split
And command posts hidden
We live in the dark sitting, hiding
Fighting military titan
Poseidon strikes from subs with powerful missiles direct firing
Stealth birds flying above looking for us
Carrying scuds while the fuzz are patroling the street for thugs
Underground shoved but love
The fact we're dodging bombs and slugs
We come crazily, metal rains fatally
And attacks all of the uniformed infantry
Readily act out our war plan steadily
Deadly actions flood the concrete
Street teams repeat the steps we need
Or defeat is the destiny we see
Don't sleep we run a tight fleet
And smash all the inner leaks and weak links
We come in packs and stay strapped
And run our plans of urban warpath
We load our gear and attack
And the enemy strikes and hits us right back
[2x]We run our plans of attack
And the enemy strikes and hits us right back
17th battalion valiant
Group of troops sent out
To scout and seek violent meetings of action
And back fellow factions
Ambush and double team regime war fashion
Strategic and tactical hits are more practical
Take out sattelites so they can't use galactical forces
Target the ammo resources
Limit the potential attack with crash courses
We leave holes in the uniforms of non-pro's
And show all of those that oppose a good war
Scores of the fight affect foes
And shows who survive in the world of battle
We settle the difference with metal rain
And those who are trained are insane
We trace the places you claim
And make sure your war faces are laced with pain
When you go against the empire
Expect return fire hits by an ex-sire
Legion of doom soon to expire
By the way they come with counter attacks we fight back
Man your battle stations
Prepare for united nations
Making an advance to our location
Set activation ring the alarm
There's no turning back expect harm
When we clash and defend our position with firearms
We come in packs and stay strapped
And run our plans of urban warpath
We load our gear and attack
And the enemy strikes and hits us right back
[2x]We run our plans of attack
And the enemy strikes and hits us right back
