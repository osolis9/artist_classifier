Put your right leg up, left leg up
Sit down like your sitting on the steps
Look to the left, look to the right
Look back at the booty and stare
Now twerk, twerk
Now twerk, twerk
Now twerk, twerk
Now twerk, twerk
I can't take myself when I step up on the scene
And all these haters joking cos' they know my swag be mean
I can do it by myself or I can do it with my team
But when I'm with my brothers we just hit that dream team
Now dream team, dream team, dream team
I'm like what these haters mean
Dream team, dream team, dream team
I'm like what these haters mean
Double tap to the right, double tap to the left
Swing your arms three times
Do your dance, Do your dance
Switch to the other side
Bunny hop to the right, Bunny hop to the left
Pull to the right two times
Look to the left
Feel on your chest
Now gone break it down, aye
Gone break it down, aye
Gone break it down, aye
Gone break it down
I say gone break it down, aye
Gone break it down, aye
Gone break it down, aye
Gone break it down
I say gone break it down
I've been flexing since a youngin'
I keep money in my pocket
I've been all around the world
See them haters they need to stop it
Milly rock my bands
I just put in the coffin
But I don't like to swerve
You can watch me Hit The Dolphin
