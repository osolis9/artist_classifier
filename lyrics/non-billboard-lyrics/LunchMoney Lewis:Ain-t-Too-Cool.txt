Ain-t-Too-Cool:LunchMoney Lewis
Baby why you staring at your cell phone?
Why you got your back against the wall?
What'cha talking 'bout with all your girlfriends?
We need to get your ass out on the floor

I know you want a baller, baby i understand
Who's wearing all that jewellery and expensive name brands
But i can show you something that ain't none of them can

Cuz I, cuz I, cuz I ain't too cool to dance
cuz this right here's my jam
Come on baby take my hand
If you ain't too cool to dance
If you ain't too cool let's

Boogie-oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie
If you ain't too cool to dance

Don't you be afraid to shake your booty
And don't you be afraid to work them hips
Pack it all up and bring it to me
I'm the one you wanna go home with

I know you want a baller, baby i understand
Who's wearing all that jewellery and expensive name brands
But i can show you something that ain't none of them can

Cuz I, cuz I, cuz I ain't too cool to dance
Cuz this right here's my jam
Come on baby take my hand
If you ain't too cool to dance
If you ain't too cool let's

Boogie-oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie
If you ain't too cool to dance

Break it down now, break it down now
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground now
Break it down now, break it down now
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground now
Shake your ass now, shake your ass now,
shake your ass make your boyfriend jealous
Shake your ass now, shake your ass now,
shake your ass make your boyfriend jealous

I know you want a baller, baby i understand
Who's wearing all that jewellery and expensive name brands
But i can show you something that ain't none of them can

Cuz I, cuz I, cuz I ain't too cool to dance
Cuz this right here's my jam
Come on baby take my hand
If you ain't too cool to dance
If you ain't too cool let's

Boogie-oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie, boogie oogie oogie
Boogie oogie
If you ain't too cool to dance

You see I'm cool
But I ain't too cool to dance
With a moonwalk right outta here
If you ain't too cool to dance
