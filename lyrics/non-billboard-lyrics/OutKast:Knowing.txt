(From this point on it only gets rougher)
Teachers at the school knowing

Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high

Well here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly, like in 'Living Color"'s Wanda, word up
Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle
Or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort
So make it last for the risk you took
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels
And a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards

All you got in the refrigerator is Bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge
And enjoy the finer things in life right? yah
Your dignity, your only sacrifice
Slim as your chances of being somebody's wife
They seeing ya butt, booty naked every night
Ain't nothing right or wrong

Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda
Now she's out of a job, she would slob on a knob
For a little less than a yard
A massage you could drill her like a sarge
She would charge and rob
Pick through yo' pockets
She got the tricks watcha and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the night stand fuckin' with this white man

She met in a little red Corvette paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around
Comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously
The was a knock on the sliding glass door
Bitch it's me
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped now I'm getting in your shit
