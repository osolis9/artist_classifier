Dedicated:Rakim
You and me (You and me)
We used to be together (Used to be)
Everyday together (Everyday)
Always (Always)

You was dead from the beginning, all i had to do was survive
In a race against millions where they lose they die
?
?
At the end of the race waiting so I used your guide
I found heaven in you, You shared your light with me
Gave me insight way before the light hit me
It's more than just a bone 'cuz we inseparable
Even when they cut the cord on the ambilocal
Never martyred a moment away
And fix whatever was wrong and always know what to say
The same way to my sisters and brothers
Always honest, and showed me what unconditional love is
The voice of a goddess, the stars twinkle in your eyes
My heaven on Earth or angel in disguise
If you was here I'd just hug and kiss you
'Cuz to me words can't explain how much I miss you

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always

I watched the ladies shine, and stay on their grind
While the world weighed heavy on the lady's mind
It was a crazy time
It's like the world stopped fast with pap's pass in '89
The harder we cry, the harder you cry too
?
It's hard to keep going, the harder you try to
?
You tried to be strong and keep the fam together
?
While you smile with your open arms
?
You said it takes some time, take it slow, but time will take it's toll
And the stakes is high, 'till the day you die
But I refuse to accept eventually that I would have to say goodbye

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
I can't beleive this could be the end

I'm starting to see how short life is
Every second it gets shorter, but your heart get warmer
And you get stronger
Even when they said you need a transplant and dialysis to live longer
?
You still managed to live life to the fullest for years
And then things got complicated
They found a donor so they operated
A gift and a curse, and concern that things took a turn for the worse
And even if I seen the signs I doubt the actions
Nothing had prepared me for what was 'bout to happen
The hospital; the 18th floor, vivid
July 18th, 2005 I can't forget it
It's that day I'll forever know
The end; the day I hope will never come

You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
I can't beleive this could be the end
