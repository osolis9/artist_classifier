Dumb-Dancin-:Will Smith
We gonna do a song, me and my

Me and my crew like to play around
Me like to laugh and joke and have fun while we going down
Born and raised in Philly
We go jam and jam and jam action' silly

We got a dance we do at a party
That we'd like to introduce to everybody
It ain't the Humpty nor the lambada
More party pump than a damn miniature

You may have seen it on my TV show
Yeah, I know, I dance like a pro
'Cause I get busy and I get loose G
On the dance floor cant another brother juice me

'Cause I'm smooth and I move loosely
With a spin or a kick like Bruce Lee
Come on, get on the floor and take the chance
Everybody, it's time to dumb dance

Now what's a dumb dance you might ask
Well, let me take you to my dumb dancing' class
It's called dumb dance 101
It's where we teach smart people how to be dumb

Here's the background and here's what's up
Back in Philly where we grew up
We used to party all the time
Just playing around and make a soul train line

This old train line the concept changed
To put it in joint got flipped and rearranged
The line turned into a contest, yo
To see who could dance not the worst but the best though

So in Philly, the dance caught on fast
People starting challenging me to dance
So I got busy quick as the music was played up
How you gonna beat me at a dance I made up

Now you know that I can throw that
Body of mine fine so I'm about to show that
Guy who thinks he can do it a bit better
I'm the creator originator so go and get a seat to sit down

So I can demonstrate a dance that's easy to do
And you don't have to contemplate a move at all
Just take a bit of a chance
Everybody, it's time to dumb dance

Everybody, in the house just clap your hands
Come on, just clap your hands, everybody
Just clap your hands

Come on, just clap your hands, everybody
Say, clap your hands, say clap your hands
Say, now we come to the real thing

Well, there it is y'all the dumb dance concept
But let me break it down for those of you who haven't got it yet
It's the new craze coming across America

And I really really really don't care if you do it with a partner
Or do it alone, if you do it at a club or you do it at home
If you really cant dance then heres ya chance
Go for yours on the dance floor everybody dumb dance

What does it all mean? I don't know
What does it all mean? I don't know
What does it all mean? I don't know
What does it all mean? I don't know, what?

What does it all mean? I don't know
What does it all mean? I don't know
What does it all mean? I don't know

Now then let us have some fun, what's up, doc?
Chas tea tea, forward back, tea tea tea, back forward

One, two, three now
Everybody reach reach over the top
Everybody reach up don't stop don't stop
Everybody reach reach over the top don't stop

Everybody reach reach over the top
Everybody reach up don't stop don't stop
Everybody reach reach over the top don't stop

Everybody reach reach over the top
