Out-With-the-Old-feat-Black-Planet-:Alley Life
Out with the old in with the new
Mark said keep it clean - do this
Straight from the streets
Run and tell them new kid
B.P. is back with the new...

Who this press don't be a stupid
Useless why you so damn dufus
A. L. K. still be the truest
If you bad mouth me then you gettin' two hits
One to the eye, one to the lip
And all this here comin' straight from the hip
And all I wanna do is just make music and get paid
like the Slim Shady dude did
For the love of the game I'ma - do this
Get rap like sex cause I - move it
And I'ma sit around for the revenue split
When the band altogether takin better new tricks
Cause I...

Being in a band it's hard to survive
When you playin' in the clubs and love to get high

Who was the people screamin' go go
The same one's that was screamin' mo' mo'
The same one's that outside the front do'
And the same one's gettin' high up in the front row

Also I like to blow doj
Get drunk throw up right before shows
Do it in the open or on the lo' lo'
I don't give - the po' po'

Yeah I'm thug and down to throw blows
Cool with it too bound to go go
If I can't get one pound of the dough
blaze and get laid round the whole globe

Yeah I like women we take the whole row
We got bitten at the mo' mo'
Meet us in 212 at 2: 44
Do whatever in the morning and go go go

Being in a band it's hard to survive
When you playin' in the clubs and love to get high

Hold up, now I know you ain't tryin' to be cute
And not salute a soldier
See I expose you, for the dirty rat you are
Found you ain't hard then your life gets scarred
turn around and player hate my. Private attention
Forward march, towards your camp
They'll be coming through the dark
Check my style, watch me now
