MLK:213
You know sometimes in my rhymes I just feel like I has to
Do what? Give ya something to mash to
(Allright)

'Cuz you know I'm the master superb superior
Interior attractions, I'm maxin', relaxin' in penthouse suites
With seven hos at my feet
To dress me, caress me, to lead me, to guide me
Protect me in, perfect be in love, don't stress me

You wanna roll on some jet skis?
You wanna roll up some green weed?
I got the key to whatever you need

As we proceed we a long way from LBC
But that's what you get when you fuck with the P I M P
I came through just to scoop you up, to Snoop you up
And tap that booty up

Taking a ride on the East Side
Made a right on MLK
What a beautiful day, what a day, what a day

Ridin' high on the East Side
Looking for a hood rat today
Don't you wanna come out and play
Come and play, come and play

Nigga please, out on these, I'm a veteran
Who stays on the beach on bicycles pedalin'
Quit meddling in my business I'm a grown man
I leave no witnesses, I'm a known man

I understand reality to the fullest
And plan on duck technicalities with a bullet
I'm full of it, out in public to the max and I like it
These bitches love it I gangsta rap

Perhaps it's an addiction because of the non fiction
Rhymes that get written, I don't know
So when cats is bullshiting and I'm steppin' it up
And if it get hot in here? I'm wetting it up

If I can't enter in with my Chucks I don't need to be going
If you can't make a thousand bucks, you don't need to be ho'ing
I'm showing the real world some 16s
Don't stop, get it girl, you a dick fiend

Taking a ride on the East Side
Made a right on MLK
What a beautiful day, what a day, what a day

Ridin' high on the East Side
Looking for a hood rat today
Don't you wanna come out and play
Come and play, come and play

Pass the pill and holler at Phil
And make a move with Shaquille in my new Snoopdeville
'Cuz I'm a vet with a cool first step
My game guaranteed to bust any bitch

That I want and I need and I have
A lot of y'all wanna come by the pad
And walk on my marble floor
Just to say you blew with the remarkable

Listen to me, baby, doll
I'm hated by many, loved by 213
Respected by all, feared by none
Hon', you stuntin' with a hall

Get involved with me, instantly you become bonded
Then eventually you'll get taught to shoot my time
(So you can hold me down)

Bonnie, daddy need you bad
You konw what you could do with a half a key?
Come on, and smash with me

Taking a ride on the East Side
Made a right on MLK
What a beautiful day, what a day, what a day

Ridin' high on the East Side
Looking for a hood rat today
Don't you wanna come out and play
Come and play, come and play

Where's the Bishop?
Bishop, pick up the phone motherfucker
I know you with Snoop
Probably fucking my old pussy, that's right

I drop pussy on the streets
And then Bishop Don the Magic Juan comes and scoops it up
Pimps it on the ho strole for me

Then sends it back to Rick James
And I make the bitch get in the booth and sing hits
That's right, bitch 'cuz I'm Rick James
