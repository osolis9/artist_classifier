Gunz-Will-Bust:Tech N9Ne
I know you know this is Kansas City where nigga life don't mean shit
So step to and immediately get yo dome split
I pack heat for days run street wit K's and hollows on a concrete crusade
You made the pill now swallow
You never thought tomorrow, you see me beam up all
Strapped down wit a pump, searchin' for the niggas on a hunt
Jerkin' on the trigga when I dump, it's not a game dude my Killaz
Will mangle anything in my range fool, when hatin' get framed moved

We play the same rules bussin' all 32 shot
Lookin' to murder you, glock they never heard of you shocked
That I'm comin' servin' you Snug Brim get flashin'
Innocent till I'm provin' guilty, Snug Brim get to blast in
And fuck the homicide charge I got expazito
A mob figure plus a lawyer and do work for kiloz'
You know the steelo real niggas never talk just listen
This deuce shit comin' wit heat up out the kitchen

Rough niggas in the street will bust for the bread and meat
Deuce 57th Street and 7 deuce be packin' heat
Punks get the fuck away from we
For we buckin' these mutha fuckin' G.U.N.Z.

Dem no won fuck with us, for what I believe I will die
Dem no won fuck with us, if any hataz wanna try
Hands gon' throw gunz with bust
Real niggas run the streets with they gats up
Everything you got and owns getting' snatched up

If you're my enemy, my energy, your rhymes are elementary
Get lost in penitentiaries when I begin this century
So mention me and I'mma heat the track up
If it's a 100 of you demons I suggest you go get back up
Load the mac up don't slack up I'mma act up on
Any mutha fucka that think he got his clown suit on get
Stepped on destroy your mind you're wasting your time
'Cause when I spit a fucking rhyme I got a million in line
To listen to me, a bitch to do me nick naming me hollow tip

With a stand off clip that'll kill your click and will kill your brain
If you can't maintain better slow your roll boy money, hungry
Ain't no ho boy that's for sure boy and you know boy
I'll whip your ass like four boys, you're a decoy I'm the real thang
I'm a genius you're a pea brain get pissed on and whipped on
So who you talkin' shit on I'mma spit on, any negative spirit that step
To me try to take my soul from under me but I got a lifetime warranty

Skatterman cat persistantly dirty from KC
Where in the drought we pay 50 for birdies package short
I call Snug and just give him the word he take you face
Before he tell on me they'll get him for purgery
Hustla's shoot shit, rob shit, loot shit, hard core convicts
Mob shit, if you snitch, killin'em on tech's new shit, new shit
Dude we crossin' the color line, nuff money nuff weed
Make a tuff nigga colorblind

We rap for curb servers that hop in and out of cars
Rep four cats wit 3rd murderers that pop in and out of bars
D12, Strange Music, Rogue Dogs, Regime, Duce Click
Doe Boyz, Yong Gunz same team, same beams
Niggas that a split you're cherries
Vigilanty's mutha fuckas with permits to carry
Bitch you scary, fuck you and that bitch you married
Cross anyone I named that shit will get you buried

Rough niggas in the street will bust for the bread and meat
Deuce 57th Street and 7 deuce be packin' heat
Punks get the fuck away from we
For we buckin' these mutha fuckin' G.U.N.Z.

Dem no won fuck with us, for what I believe I will die
Dem no won fuck with us, if any hataz wanna try
Hands gon' throw gunz with bust
Real niggas run the streets with they gats up
Everything you got and owns getting' snatched up

It's all out war 4 the punks funk finna jump
Chumps get a lump when I dump tonks for the bianks
Gump wanna thump over pumps and a bump
Rumps get it krunk when I skunk runts
I'mma munk what you bunk niggas want
Fuck what you thunk you get sunk in and trunk
Fuck that we done heard and took enough crap

Trust we bust back when muskrats bust caps
I'm tryin' to touch scratch and bring my hell to parties and
For the last time mutha fuck Vell Bakardi
You cannot rap with me scrap with me
Nigga to the back of me catastrophe
Hits you're shits raggedy it had to be this tragedy shit
Suck it up don't be mad at me bitch I'm glad to be rich
You gets none with that fagoty pitch

I'mma ex-poppin' shroom droppin' rock and roll star
You's a no coppin' ho stalkin' drunk and a old fart it's a shame
Think you quick but you heard we flow quicker plus the bitches
Don't wanna fuck a black herpe nose nigga
This is it yaw, dump this pussy off I a pit dog
Doe stackin' and hip hop it must not be his nitch yaw
So take the chicken exit, technina's whassup
Next time grown folks talkin' you shut the fuck up
