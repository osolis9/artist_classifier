She-Got-a-Man-at-Home:Pretty Willie
[humming]
Pretty Willie...
Look, look

[Chorus: Pretty Willie]
She got a man at home (got a man at home)
That playa always gone (that playa always gone)
That's why she ringin' my phone (that's why she
ringin' my phone)
Cause she don't wanna be alone (she don't wanna be
alone)
I'm tryin' to tell her that's a no no no no (no no no
no)
Noooo, nooo ohh (Noooo, nooo ohh)
Nooooooooo, noo oh no no oh no

[Verse: Pretty Willie]
So I hear ya playa gone, so you callin' me
I knew this stuff was going down, when I checked my
caller ID
Caught her crying put your clothes on, and I'm on my
way
Gotta let you know it's going down
She said she was tired of all this lying, tired of all
this cheating
Tired of being lonely, she tired of misdeceiving
I asked her could I hold, she kindly told me yes
She trying to leave her man because I hear ya the
best

[Chorus]

[Verse: Pretty Willie]
Now after all that didn't went down, she didn't even
call
Actin' like I didn't need her, but deep down it was
I knew I had broke her off, but I questioned myself
Next time I seen her we were off by ourselves
She said she was always thinking of me and what was
she to do
I'm chillin' wit my man, and all I want is you
I told her it was over, you don't want to be wrong
Two hours freakin' late and she was ringin' my phone

[Chorus]

[Verse: Omaze]
But each mornin' as the sun crept, we overslept
This ordinary moment that's left while we getting'
dressed
Forget we interrupted by our last goodbyes
I see the worry in your eyes, confusion makin' you
cry
Cause I let you love, but it's him that you wit
No more than lovers we can be and even that's
illegitimate
Damn, where do we go from here
Which way do we turn, your well-being is my only
concern
And I learned to give you your desire
This ecstasy is testin' me got me getting' higher what
I desire
Total dedication but neva neva
Cause every night it's with him that you lay
Yet it's for me that you pray
And they say that's it's all just a part of the game
Everytime you find the right one she's stuck with a
lame
Damn shame we can never be one
And we both know this, but the passion when we
smashin'?
It help to keep them? hopeless

[Chorus]

[Pretty Willie talking]
Yea, uh uh
Suella...
I'm tellin' y'all look...
If y'all ain't gunna take care of your girl
A playa like Pretty Willie will [laughing]
Yea... uh, just keep it real (uh, yea)
Cause a lot a y'all gun neglect her
But it take a pretty boy like me...
To just step into place
So, spend a little time playboy
You'll be all good, don't let a playa like me get her
Fo real... Suella
JL... Frontline
