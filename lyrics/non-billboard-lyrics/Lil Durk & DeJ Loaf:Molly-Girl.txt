Molly-Girl:Lil Durk & DeJ Loaf
[Hook]
I'm in molly world, I need a molly girl
Pineapple swirl, keep me in molly world
Right now because I'm bussin', feel on top of the world
I'm out here off a molly, I need a molly girl
I'm in molly world, I'm in molly world
Bitch I'm out here bussin', I need a molly girl
I'm in molly world, I'm in molly world
Bitch I'm off the shits, I need a molly girl

[Verse 1]
Bitch I need a molly, I'm off one in the party
I just copped me a 'Rari, I'm global like safari
Your bitch she need a molly, she ride me like a Harley
I chop her like a Harley, O.T.F. we are the party
Yeah bitch I'm rolling, all my bottles golden
Got her in here zoning, take one ain't no folding
My dick that bitch be holding, all this money throwing
All this money throwing, all this money throwing
Bitch I'm bout that life, off one ain't no sleep
Bitch you must be scared off a whole fucking piece
Bitch I'm in the streets, fuck nigga don't want no beef
300 that's the team, 300 that's the team

[Verse 2]
Molly girl my supermodel, I don't need my Gucci goggles
Pop one and might rep a viagra , T.R.U. Religion my true religion
Foreign car my roof missing, white on white I'm a fool with it
White on white I’m a fool with it. In that spotlight I’m a fool with it
I'm out here like everyday, I get money in every way
Went to jail for my petty case, molly world that's a better place
L's up for my hater's face, I'm energized like Gatorade
Cooking shit like Rachel Ray, O.T.F. till I die in the grave
Bitch I'm out here rolling, all these bitches going
Kush too strong, that potent, she wetter than an ocean
Molly got her in motion , and lean is what I'm pouring
Molly, where we going
That molly, where we going
