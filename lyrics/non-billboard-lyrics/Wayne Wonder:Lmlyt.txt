Let me love you tonight
As we get closer
Let me love you tonight
I know it's gonna be alright

Let me love you tonight
Baby come over
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you, love you

You're just what I need
You should know
Baby I won't hurt you
Let me rock you and stayed in the snow
Baby got to take slow
Cause I thought that I just wanna make you mine
It's you and me every day until the end of time

I can feel your heart beating
Making pounding sounds
It's sexual healing
Baby let me love you down
And I don't need nobody else
Oh girl, as long as I have you for myself

No, I will never let you go
Never let you go nowhere
You are my little sunshine
Baby and it's all so clear
It feels so good when we are together
Together baby
So let me love you
Way beyond forever
