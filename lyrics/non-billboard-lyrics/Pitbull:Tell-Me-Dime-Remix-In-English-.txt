Mamita why we gotta keep going through this

[Frankie J:]
Just yesterday you said you loved me
That There's nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine that there was no limits to us skys
Then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
Now you telling me to leave I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me it's hurting my soul
Oh baby

[Chorus:]
How am I suppose to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go?
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
Can't you see I'm slowly dying but I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

[PITBULL:]
Let me start by telling you that I love you with all my heart
But I can't understand the reason
When you telling me to leave
Girl me and you were suppose to be for ever and ever
But instead of being in love it's like we're used to each other
How could we do this to each other
We used to ride for each other die for each other cry for each other
But now it's like all we wanna do is say bye to each other
I can't let this happen I refuse to lose you
I love you baby it's the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy girl
It ain't hard to see you mean the world to me
We've been through it all thick and thin right or wrong
I can't let you go cause this love to strong

[Chorus:]
How am I suppose to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go?
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
Can't you see I'm slowly dying but I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

[PITBULL:]
Look baby just tell me what you want
Look baby just tell me what you need
Look baby I know I'm far from perfect
The game and the money they can take cause it's worthless
I know it's hard to deal with my life
I know it's hard to deal with all the gossip
I've seen him with this one I've seen him with that one
But everything that they say is nothing but nonsense
Can you feel it in my voice mami
You're my heart my soul my love and I swear to you baby
I just wanna give you my heart my soul my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can baby let's try
But the one thing I won't do is let this love die

[Chorus:]
How am I suppose to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go?
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
Can't you see I'm slowly dying but I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

[FRANKIE J:]
Don't ever leave me yes I'm dyin to let you go
The only thing I get from it
Is all this crying
Tell me how am
I suppose to let you go (no, no, no)

[Chorus:]
How am I suppose to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go?
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
Can't you see I'm slowly dying but I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go
