So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know

And maybe later on
We can go somewhere

Walkin' right past me in stiletteo shoes,
Hold up,

The type when you see comin
Everybody stop- stops
It's what they doin'
And lil' mama looks like that type
Let me slide a little closer when my time is right
And the way that your movin'
Your movin' draws me in closer into it,

I'm sure ya hear it all the time
But I don't spit lines,
I don't waste my breath shit... on all that mess
If I said it then I meant it
Not to try to get between ya
And I ain't gotta wow you,
To make you a believer
Some like to make it rain, yeah we can make it rain
Like JD once said, shit; money ain't a thang"
I ain't tryin' ta impress ya

Like these champaign bottles
