Uh Uh Oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we're getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter
Let's shut it down

Yo what I gotta do to show these girls that I own them
Some call me Nicki and some call me Roman
Skeezer pleaza I'm in Ibiza (woah)
Giuseppe Zannotti my own sneaker
Sexy, sexy that's all I do
If you need a bad bitch let me call a few
Pumps on and them little mini skirts is out
I see some good girls I'ma turn them out
Okay bottle sip bottle guzzle
I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (what)
Bottle sip bottle guzzle
I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (let's go)

Music makes me high

Uh Uh Oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we're getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter
Let's shut it down

Pound the alarm

So get me now and knock this over
I wanna do it like you like, like
Come get me baby we're not getting younger
I just want you tonight night
Baby we gone do this for life life

Uh Oh

Music makes me high

Uh Uh Oh
Come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we're getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter
Let's shut it down

Pound the alarm

You know we're getting hotter and hotter
