Miscellaneous
Roll Wit MVP
[2x]
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

[Chorus]
[3x in the background]
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

We be like
They be like
And everybody's feelin' right singin'
They singin'
We singin'
That's how we do it all night like
Get 'em like
Feelin' like
And ain't a damn thing wrong baby
Stagga Lee and we up in the zone
Got the keys to the crib
And ain't nobody home

[Verse 1]
Well I'm a sixteen spitter (um hum)
Mr. team hitter spleen splitter with a dream
Flip a scene green getter get 'em
Out in the streets with the 19" spinnin' me
Grinning because every single man on my team is winnin'
We sittin' in your trees reachin' up to the sky singin'
(La la la la la la la la la la la)
Yo, hey yo, we rock illa killa
Scratched off the serial
Brothers sayin' Stagga still ain't on that's a miracle
Fuck chicks in the sixes with their name on the leash
Whole reason why I speak on them beats freak on a leash
Ya, Stag cool like cotton clothes when I droppin' flows
Bros want me to stop and pose when I shop for clothes
And yo, I be lovin' it, just look in my eye, I feel like
(La la la la la la la la la la la)
Cars bumpin', CD pumpin' on your block in the summer
Showin' love for Stag we can get high if you wanna
We singin'

[Chorus]
[3x in the background]
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

We be like
They be like
And everybody's feelin' right singin'
They singin'
We singin'
That's how we do it all night like
Get 'em like
Feelin' like
And ain't damn thing wrong baby
Stagga Lee and we up in the zone
Got the keys to the crib
And ain't nobody home

[Verse 2]
We can get the rims spinnin'
And your team winnin'
And your chick screenin' just like me
We can pull an all nighter
I got my own driver
We can leave but your man might see
This for the fly hunnies with their own money
You just might meet a man like me
We can get the spot droppin'
There will be no stoppin' when you rollin' wit MVP

[Verse 3]
We I roll up they be like (um hum)
What you doin' pa
Brothers be like how you doing bra when I'm cruisin' by
Whenever I'm feelin' lovely I thank the Lord above me
And I be like (la la la la la)
And then we crackin' bubbly
You see me at the bar sittin' with the fine women
Sippin' on that white wine grinnin' while my time tickin'
I think that every girl got a little dime in 'em
Got a little der and shine in 'em.
Take your time get 'em
(La La La La La)
Means they all wrapped in it
Maxin out da cards wit the all plat limit
Built my whole world from nada girls we gotta a lotta that probably wanna be my baby's mama,
Cause I'ma fresh kid hot and got a lot invested,
every lyric I drop ghetto block tested
I wreck cd and cassette decks reckless leave off the last "s" for skills I practiced.

La la la la la

Singin'
They feelin'
And sayin'
You gotta turn it up loud like. 
Pumpin' like
Bumpin' like
I'm 'bout to hit 'em right now wit da
A little 
Some of dat
I got 'em singin' my song baby
Stagga Lee and I'm up in the zone
Got the keys to the crib and ain't nobody home 

They feelin'
And sayin'
You gotta turn it up loud like. 
Pumpin' like
Bumpin' like
I'm 'bout to hit 'em right now wit da
A little 
Some of dat
I got 'em singin' my song baby
Stagga Lee and I'm up in the zone
Got the keys to the crib and ain't nobody home
