So, I told her like oh darliAnnotaten

My friends say Im trippin but baby I dont really give a f*ck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know whats up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

Im like Girl whatcha doin for today?
Im thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I dont believe in love at first sight
But after seein you baby maybe I might
Cause when you walked by. I knew you were my type
The apple of my eye. Youre flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) Im just warmin up

Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin caught up
Goin down, goin down, yeah Im shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up
And If you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but youre so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didnt gimme a glance. Damn

Yeah, yeah, I said Girl whatcha doin on the weekend
And she said I dont even know depends
But youre the one that Ive been seein in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening
I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, Ill put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, Ill be in the deep end

Ha. Your beauty got me sinkin
Got me sayin all this shit without thinkin
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that Im always repeatin

But its the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if youre a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn, she was apparently
