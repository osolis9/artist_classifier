You-re-the-One-feat-Mario-Winans-:Guerilla Black
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh baby
Oh oh oh, oh baby, oh yeah

I remember, when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck and spilled my Hen-Dawg
Yes you, God blessed you
I was trying to get next to you

Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like "Where?"
It was somethin' so different about you
I felt so gifted around you

Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's

You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you how I hugged you
Better yet love you like this thug do

It's official, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feelin'
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
'Cause I know that, baby you're the one

I'm having the time of my life, felt the world on wheels
You and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do or better yet real like you
I messed around and killed dude

I seen homegirly just flossin', we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin', me never
You and B l a c k forever
Tattered on my neck in green letters

Late night eatin' Haagen-Dazs, watchin' Uncut
And me sittin' there, playin' wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the couch
Even though mom's in the house

Nothin' could replace this feelin'
It's like winnin' 2 million, our bond closer than Sicilians
I know old boy won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong

It's official, you're the one, but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feelin'
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one

I couldn't leave well enough alone
Hell, I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this
"I love you, mmmuah!"

I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him

You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin' a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call 'The Beat' and 'The Power'
Dedicate songs every hour

All hell done broke loose
He got your pass code to your cell and my Nextel chirp too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your life?

It's official, you're the one, but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feelin'
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one

It's official, you're the one, but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feelin'
You're the one, I wish I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one
