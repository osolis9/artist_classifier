Bills-Dirty-Version-:LunchMoney Lewis
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'ma gon' work, work, work everyday
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'ma gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills!
All these bills pile up my desk
They looking like a mount' (everest)
All the little kids run around
I can hear their stomachs growl
It's a full moon out
And my girl just keep on howling
she said she gonna leave me
if I don't home with fifty thousand
God damn, god damn, god damn, god damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
God damn, oh man, god damn, oh man
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work everyday
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills
Woke up and I bumped my head
Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
Neighbor damn dog done crapped on my lawn
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
Behind an old lady in the grocery line
Praying that my card don't get declined
God damn, god damn, god damn, god damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
God damn, oh man, god damn, oh man
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got!
And my shoes, my shoes
I said my shoes!
Ain't got no soul
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills.
Mama got bills
Yo daddy got bills
Yo sister got bills
Yo auntie got bills
Uncle got bills
I got bills
Everybody got bills! Everybody got bills!
