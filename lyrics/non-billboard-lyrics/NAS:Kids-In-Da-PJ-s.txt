Kids-In-Da-PJ-s:NAS
To the kids in da PJ's, ghetto children, I know it ain't easy
Y'all wanting millions, sunshine turns to rain
It's ghetto pain when a one time raise
Sometimes, the young is slain

To the kids in da PJ's black babies brought up in this world
Where it's wild and crazy child of the Nile
Future lifestyle looks hazey, dreams to drive a Mercedes
With a pile of ladies

Third grade singing star spangled banner using proper manners
Learnt to handle anger animal behavior
Later on my block rocking with my jocks on
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn, humming a 'KISS' rock song

Socks long to my knees, summer breeze running through the leaves Playing freeze tag, can I stay out please, dad?
Can I hang out with my little gang out? Hearing shots rang out
Heard my moms call my name out, come upstairs run up stairs

Take a bath, shit stained underwear, wipe yourself with paper bad
Little ass in my bed at 8:30 wash my plate, ate dinner up late
Gazing at the wall praying, basketball was my future for this young one
Hoping in the sun, proud to be where I come from
Later shooting guns fantasizing, fascinated by gold rope chains
Looking back at my hood days but things ain't changed

To the kids in da PJ's, ghetto children, I know it ain't easy
Y'all wanting millions, sunshine turns to rain
It's ghetto pain when a one time raise
Sometimes, the young is slain

To the kids in da PJ's black babies brought up in this world
Where it's wild and crazy child of the Nile
Future lifestyle looks hazey, dreams to drive a Mercedes
With a pile of ladies

In my hood niggaz smoke wood, nothing is good
Look at my eyes and see what I could living my life
And feel what I felt the hand that I was dealt
Drama that my uncle Shabazz had, I was a little lad

Niggaz shooting through my Grams window, shattering glass
Had the chicken pox on that toy horse that rocks
My moms grabbed me down to safety
everybody in the crib was going crazy

That was in the 80's and now I'm 17, money cash dreams
Niggaz be slave, I be brave spit like A.K.'s and S.K.'s
Close range niggaz see brains, Millennium Thugs the name
But now it's slash cocaine, blast niggaz in vain, satch yo' chain

Cherish the life, my niggaz got a fetish for ice
Turn out the lights, I bust, so I could spar up the night
Uniting the pipes, Queens bridge niggaz is shiest
Need no price body, y'all dudes on spite

Who knew I would of spazzed out
Little Nay shawn owner of the crack house
Get my papes on
Tired of 'friderators all the steaks gone

Now, picture this shit with six aunts, five uncles
Thugging a double apartment out kids, cousins, and brothers
There I go in the pamper by the radiator, cursing eatin' first
Little nigga with a appetite that got worst first day of school
Ten man cliq, all I'm learning is how to extort shit

'Cuz class I forfeit, graduated on another level
Selling birds busting birds, fuck with the herbs
Never we fuck up the herbs, make 'em pay like you
Stick 'em up get down, since ten, was taught to turn 'em around
Rip they pockets out, bust two the way they run
I ain't give a fuck that's how I was, I was young

To the kids in da PJ's, ghetto children, I know it ain't easy
Y'all wanting millions, sunshine turns to rain
It's ghetto pain when a one time raise
Sometimes, the young is slain

To the kids in da PJ's black babies brought up in this world
Where it's wild and crazy child of the Nile
Future lifestyle looks hazey, dreams to drive a Mercedes
With a pile of ladies

Horse was born as a brave child, big for my size
A bully to little guys, with chocolate milks and apple pies
The playground was mine, I stayed scarred up all the time
From shopping carts flipping, now we race to the finish line

Hated playing cooties 'cuz that shit wasn't fun
All the honey's say I'm it, then they little ass run
I was sweared to put a hickey on the ones that I caught
I was a nasty little nigga, I learned to hump before I walk
Kept a sling shot on my side to shoot squirrels and cats

Wanted to be Captain America with the Shillinger hat
I started getting older, fell more in love with the streets
Infatuated by the ropes and the shiny gold teeth
I was to big to break dance, fuck spinning on my back

My role models now run numbers and sell crack
This project, child blessed, chasing ghetto success
He needs a name for himself to get the same respect
