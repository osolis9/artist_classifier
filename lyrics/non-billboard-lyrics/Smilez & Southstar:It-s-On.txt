It-s-On:Smilez & Southstar
"It's On"

[Intro:]
You think it's a game huh
What you thing it's a game
Smilez, Southstar?

[Smilez]
I know you can't believe how chicks show us love
Meant shit for the night and even with us
All I hear haters yellin' is cuss cuss
Cause every we touch we bust bust
Could it be that truck sittin' on dubs
From the way we VIP it up
Got six fetti girls for the afterclub
You know damn well that's a must
It don't? wrist don't shine, pop cris all the time
With a dime "IS THAT YOUR BITCH?"
Damn right you take a life into this
I got big balls, ya'll?
Please no list, I don't need a gat
I got a song like thunder, Thundercats
Murder cats, rap like anthrax
Me and South is here nigga stand on back

[Southstar]
Don't you like how we flip our style
Doing it for the dirty South
and all the heads in the caddy slowin' it down
Jumpin' it around got ya feelin' it now
O-town we gon' stay throwin it up
If you runnin' outta mo then we fillin' it up
Only rules that we follow not givin' a fuck
Diggin them sluts, it's only 'bout gettin' them bucks
Yeah, here now so we runnin' the state
And ya'll gon' mention us a month?
High school, we done graduate
And the big leagues now steppin' up to the plate
Ya keep on bouncin' spillin your drinks
Keep your chains out swingin' the links
When we hit the tour we makin' everyone sing
Smilez and Southstar making ya sing

[Chorus]
The girls go (Ahh ahh)
My thugs go (Ohh ohh)
The crowd go (Ohh ohh)
Tonight it's on
[2x]

[Smilez]
Who you know spend it quick like son
? right now rip out his tongue
Ya use like styles when you sexin' huh
Smilez? trol your?
You know the block on lock when I pull up in the spot
Your rims get dull when I put up on my watch
Spectators like damn they need to stop
Then they see the truck "OH MY GOSH!"
When i'm in the club, we livin' it up
Thugs wanna act up then send me and?
Chicks always wanna fuck and they givin' it up
You gotta see the way we tossin' it up
You ain't ready for war ready for dogs
Smilez get it on man with the best of ya
So bring your whole crew set,? and all
I make? tenders underdogs

[Southstar]
Ya wanna brag when i'm better than ya
I even get your girl wetter than ya
It don't take me mugh to get in the draws
So let me know when you ready to start
Why ya frontin' ya know who we are
Got more props or ya hatin' more
What happen dog we was cool before
Sitll mad at me cause I was hittin' yours
Cause she hop in the whip hill back to top
Cruise the strip, damn it started gettin' hot
When we step on the gas man fuck the cops
Once we got to the telley she was like "Don't stop"
Yeah, that's how players do
We'll steal your chicks and slay your crew
Never lie, always speak the truth
If you still not sure we'll show and prove

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Pump, pump let me see that?
Come on now drop, drop
Baby girl don't quit, quit
[2x]

[Smilez]
Smilez get'em out of their seats
Out of their clothes, sex is all repeat
Me fallin' out nigga that's blast is me
The only way i'm Fallin' is Alicia Keys
There a lot of millions ya'll gon' stop us
Ya scared of heights, how ya gon' top us
This an? that's your only option
Get your glasses stupid to watchin'

[Southstar]
So the freaks is talkin' out
Made it to the top and they wonderin' how
Stay lookin' down like we sittin' on clowds
Stay on tour while rippin' the crowds
And we keep ya singin' along
Keep all the DJ's droppin' the bombs
Team is strong money is long
So, tonight it's on

[Chorus 4x]
