Head-Bobs:The Black Eyed Peas
I'm hard to handle like bikes with no bars<br />
We excite stores that got even doors<br />
Unlock the heated 'cause they know when I sex well<br />
Left them breathless now they're waiting to exhale<br />
Waiting to exhale with some competition<br />
<br />
So come in and test well<br />
The next one gets hung and chip of a chisel<br />
I'm making chicks sizzle<br />
There's no question to the way I rip the riddle<br />
I'm awesome, I bring on monsoon when I bloom and blossom<br />
<br />
And run over like opossums<br />
Froze on the road with my bike on they cornea<br />
Man I'm warning ya, look, the black eyed peas is formin' up<br />
Ring around your throat that's made up of razor blades<br />
Put the slice and let nice and easy humble days<br />
<br />
On out, over, well known casanova<br />
Can I put on an army, quick to take it over<br />
Nine on my, count all my figures<br />
Money on the street went entertainment<br />
Nowadays brothers are getting paid doing nothing<br />
<br />
Reciting the same line with the lame rhymes<br />
Frontin' rappers actin' like their pops' was orville Redenbacher<br />
They quick to go pop<br />
But when it's time to fiend for the green they flop<br />
We do it from the heart like blood<br />
Create rhymes that flood, and blow up like the Scud missile<br />
Miss out, ha<br />
<br />
You can bop your head like this, ha<br />
When we're dropping bombs like this, ha<br />
You can bop your head to this, ha<br />

My probation over tracks smacks like no other disciples<br />
Riddle the action of satisfaction brought to you be apple<br />
Alligator now, 'bout to take you on a lyrical voyage<br />
And bend your sure form I would saturated fat<br />
The alligat is on the move<br />
<br />
I rhyme to be exact, not exactly on the groove<br />
Several, wopplers, kinetic<br />
My beat's energetic when reseted<br />
You wonder why, we put our friend who caligetic<br />
So check out the fiery, I'm livin' not misery<br />
<br />
Supply you with remedies for all these sick whack MC's<br />
That this is song lurks now, time to go to work<br />
To senegrate the ignorant, or shall I say the jerk<br />
Time to contradict now, dig deep to the core<br />
All I sick can be, but I still rip it raw<br />
<br />
With the composition, with the position on steady<br />
I'm ready for the mission of freestylin' acting shitty<br />
Converse you with the energy enemy I focus on ya<br />
Every styles you make I will take and break in front of ya<br />
Irratic gets your presence you've been replaced by my essence<br />
<br />
The sunshine survive, 'cause that's what we produce<br />
Refuse to take our ability I use<br />
To bruise up your brain with lyrics<br />
Like this, ha<br />

This is who we is a 3 D, can he get back from where we enter<br />
Lovely entertainment's what we enter<br />
Feel the force, where we enter like splinter<br />
Black eyed peas be the fools that'll injure<br />
Whole career and your body will be injured<br />
<br />
Get dealt quick, and I got one for, uh<br />
How you like me now<br />
W I double l rippin' up a style<br />
That's cool and calm, we droppin' a bomb<br />
And you can nod your head to the rhythm where we are<br />
<br />
Some whole new, uh that's well improved<br />
When I'm over 'cause you know I'ma relax in a rule<br />
That soothes your body, really really hardcore<br />
Double, double ta, ta for a while or for raw<br />
Tap,a, tap a skill, it's the whip appeal then<br />
<br />
Apple, Apple comin', comin' in with the gill<br />
Let's rock this set exceed to terminate<br />
Time to eliminate the whack that you create<br />
Arm atticulate, when I circulate over tracks<br />
Let me get down and just relax<br />
<br />
We gettin' down y'all<br />
We gettin' down y'all<br />
We gettin' down like this<br />
We gettin' down y'all<br />
