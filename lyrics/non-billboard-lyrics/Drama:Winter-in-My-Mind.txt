Winter-in-My-Mind:Drama
Remember how
The way we were
The way we used to be
So hot to trot
I thought we could not stop
We would rock constantly baby

I know the clothes you wear
And every car you drive
All the people in your life
That whole vibe baby
But where I lost my way
I shoulda spent the time
With your soul and in your mind getting it right baby

And I wish that I had known this before
Instead of opening I closed every door
Shoulda known that I had lost you for sure
Wherever you are now
You must have so much more

I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah

Now understand
I recognise that I'm a better man
'Cause of you baby
Let me take your hand
Oh I see you want it back
I guess that I'm too late baby

I know the grass is greener on the other side
Maybe someone's in your life
That's ok by me
Yeah girl you taught me that
There's so much more inside
It's so sad I've seen the light
In some bad time

And I wish that I had known this before
Instead of opening I closed every door
Shoulda known that I had lost you for sure
Wherever you are now
You must have so much more

I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
I know its summer where you are
But you left me here alone
Now it's winter in my mind yeah
