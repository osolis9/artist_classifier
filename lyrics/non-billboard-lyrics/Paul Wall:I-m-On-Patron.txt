I-m-On-Patron:Paul Wall
I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home?
I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home?

Hey wat it do, I'm on like a light switch
My wrist well froze up like a computer glitch
I'm drinkin' 151 karaboolu, take nine gone get it jumpin'
Like a kangaroo is it cho birthday, let's go on have

A shot or two, my partner Glu, you put me on to somethin' new
Snuck in a gallon of lemonade from chic-fil-a
Mix it up with this a rokin', we gona party
I'm lookin' for a hot girl that like ta ay bay, bay, bay

Come out and play let's see ya shake it this way
That Patron clear as day, I'm on that hard
I'm getting' lit wit my dawgs havin' a party with
Their brods

I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home?
I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home?

Gone and poppin' another bottle, get this party to crakin'
All these barby doll models make the champs start backin'
550's everywhere nothing can't depend it, he's on his fifth premiere
At seven, it ain't even eleven

Thug boss slim thug drikin' GPO
Greygoose, Patron and orange juice, po' me som mo'
Now box and poppy Joe just ordered the rose mo
Drunkin' duces to my partner, how I see him big go

I'm loaded like a full clip, leanin' like a sinkin' ship
Lit up like a Christmas tree, how much throwd up can I get
C Stone and Lil' C bringin' out the eager bomb
If I get pulled over, DJ Jonny can pay my bond off

I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home?
I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome

I keep bumpin' into people, say man my bad
I'm intoxicated a tad and the DJ had to be
Miskin' Mike and Scad, my family gettin' slammed
Needs a cool wages bought around another damn grand

Man I'm so throwed, I can't think
Who the hell been puttin' they lips on my drink
What the hell the waitress doin' wit my change
Maybe some Red Bull will help you sober up

Matter fact, mix it wit this Greygoose in my cup
I can barely stand up, I'm about to throw up
If you can't roll with the big dawgz go hang wit the pups

I'm on Patron, I just took some shots to tha dome
I'm gone, so gone, so yo, can I get a ride home?
