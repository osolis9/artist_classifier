Dem-Days:Dae Dae
Intro:
Uh huh
Birthdays
Sometimes the worst days
Sometimes we, we celebrate, right?
This the celebration

Chorus:
Birthday was the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day were them latewood days
I remember like it was motherfuckin' Tuesday
Sign a deal that's that Diddy Hollywood
I kept it real with my partner in the hood
Money comin' I'm just stackin' on them gifts
I ain't dodgin' I ain't runnin' from no nigga

Verse #1:
Latewood get a hoe down on ?
I was sellin' dope my daddy had the soda
Yeah that trap was bangin' hard it was rollin'
I was 14, everything I had was stolen
I remember dark nights I had in that backway
Couldn't nothing come through when I be in that backway (I remember)
Young nigga walkin' with that fire on me (Glock)
Only other thing he love to do is shoot dice
Made my nigga got up on that brickwalk
Ou don't make him mad don't get him pissed off
I remember the day they were them good days
I can never get them latewood days homie

Chorus:
Birthday was the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day were them latewood days
I remember like it was motherfuckin' Tuesday
Sign a deal that's that dirty Hollywood
I kept it real with my partner in the hood
Money comin' I'm just stackin' on them gifts
I ain't dodgin' I ain't runnin' from no nigga

Verse #2:
I remember hard days in that latewood
I remember dark days n' they feel good
Ain't no time to part late my shit don't kiss good
Know some niggas that'll ride for me on Boom street
Know some niggas that'll die for me and lose for me
Know some niggas that'll split the pie and shoot for me
L-O-V-E, L-I-F-E, know we love life, over everything
Nigga no jewelry on Im'ma still bling
Bitch nigga turn that oven off, we got it hot up in this bitch
Free Kant, Free Lil Dida they got him ridin' in that bitch
15 years of his birthdays, them the worst days

Chorus:
Birthday was the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day were them latewood days
I remember like it was motherfuckin' Tuesday
Sign a deal that's that dirty Hollywood
I kept it real with my partner in the hood
Money comin' I'm just stackin' on them gifts
I ain't dodgin' I ain't runnin' from no nigga

Outro:
Birthdays were the worst days
Still ride with my shooters
Hard day with them latewood days
