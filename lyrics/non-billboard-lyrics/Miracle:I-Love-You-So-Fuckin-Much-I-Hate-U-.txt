I-Love-You-So-Fuckin-Much-I-Hate-U-:Miracle
I thought you told me that you'd never fuckin' leave me
You would be by my side
For you, I lay down my pride, confess the feelings inside
Normally, I wouldn't sigh, if a bitch chose to ride

But you don't find too many hoes that are down to die
And are down to ride or look a cop up in the eye
Tell that pussy motherfucker she don't know who, where, or why
A perfect fuckin' liar, and in the bed a live-wire

She suck so fucking fire, make a nigga balls tired
Never left me astray, cooked a hot plate everyday
And when them cops locked me up, she kept a smile on her face
And even though her fuckin' friends told her she should leave me

'Cause all I did was fuck her, smoke weed, and then I split
She said, "I won't leave my nigga, I'd take a bullet for my niggaâ€
Say, "Fuck the house up, nigga, go home make that nigga dinnerâ€

Appetizer, big fat blunt, for desert, my cunt
Sunny-side fuckin' up, face down, booty up
Even take it up the butt, deep throat his fuckin' nuts
I don't give a flying fuck, shit that's my nigga, what

Sometimes, I think I love you bitch so fuckin' much
I'd fuckin' lie for you and die for you and wouldn't give a fuck
I put my pistol in your hand 'cause I know you would bust
And wouldn't close my eyes at night, if I had no trust

I fuckin' hate you, I hate you, I hate you
(I love you)
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
(Because I love you)

I love you so fuckin' much, bitch that I hate you
(I fuckin' love you)
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
(Because I love you)

I hate you, I hate you
(I love you so fuckin' much, I fuckin' hate you)
I fuckin' love you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
(Because I love you)

I hate you, I hate you
(I love you so fuckin' much, I fuckin' hate you)
I love you

I remember the first time that I told you I smoked
I remember the first time that I stopped slangin' dope
I remember the first time that we ever fucked
I remember the first time that I had to bust

You was right by my side the night the pussy niggas tried
To take me for my car and probably try to take my life
Looked 'em dead in the eye and I didn't even know why
You told them coward motherfuckers you wasn't afraid to die

You pulled your pistol out and bust, I was like, what the fuck?
I pulled my pistol out too so I could blast with you boo
We were like Bonnie and Clyde, as I speed off in the ride
After liquor and some blunts that shit had left out my mind

You never told a fuckin' soul that them bitches had died
Since neither had I, the DA had to let it ride
When put up under pressure you showed you would not fold
You do exactly what you're told and thats exactly what you showed
Got a heart straight from heaven and a pussy straight from hell
Definition of a thug bitch, you define it well

Sometimes I think I love you bitch, so fuckin' much
I'd fuckin' lie for you, die for you and wouldn't give a fuck
I put my pistol in your hand, 'cause I know you would bust
And wouldn't close my eyes at night if I had no trust

I fuckin' hate you, I hate you, I hate you
I love you so fuckin' much, bitch that I hate you, I hate you
I hate you, I love you so fuckin' much, bitch that I hate you
I hate you, I hate you, I love you so fuckin' much, bitch that I hate you

I hate you, I fuckin' hate you, I fuckin' hate you
Now what, what
(I fuckin' hate you, that's why I love you)
What, what
(I fuckin' hate you, that's why I love you)

(I fuckin' hate you, that's why I love you)
What, what
(I fuckin' hate you, that's why I love you)
What, what, what
