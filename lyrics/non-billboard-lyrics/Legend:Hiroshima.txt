Hiroshima:Legend
Third degree burns and twisted limbs
Men can't repents such evil sins
Cities leveled, molecular pain
The rising sun won't rise again

But it had to be done, the pigs all cried
We tried to warn them, the pigs all lied

Children born within it's cloud
Genetic disease the eternal shroud
The water boiled the sky turned black
Time zero was the final attack

But it had to be done, the pigs all cried
We tried to warn them, the pigs all lied

Hiroshima!
Hiroshima!
Hiroshima!
Hiroshima!

Oh rising sun your children weep
Will your memories of pain ever sleep
Will the book of life explain the cause
As the only way to stop all wars?

But it had to be done, the pigs all cried
We tried to warn them, the pigs all lied
