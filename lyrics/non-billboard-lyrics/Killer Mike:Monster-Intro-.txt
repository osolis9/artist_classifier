Monster-Intro-:Killer Mike
[** feat. Big Rube:]


Peace will never tame the hatred in me*
I'm too restricted
Seperated from your society
I'm a new breed of species
A curse to lips that speak my name
I'm different, twisted
My mind is not the same
For those who deny the truth
But seek to try to find it
You my friend are blind to the truth
For you are simple minded
My ways are called abnormal
They treat me as if forsaken
But all shall fear the Wrath
Just like when my heart was taken
And if these words fail to reach the ears of the limited few
You won't know but when I strike you'll wish that you would have knew
This beast is on the loose if you treasure life then destroy it
For it is too realistic to simply ignore it
I've given a fair warning now beware because I'm cutting loose
And new terror walks the Earth
And now it's all up to you
If all hope should fair and you should sit an ponder
You fate has been decided by one dangerous monster
