Day-Dreaming:DJ Drama
Shirley Temple on ice, she makes it just right
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her body's so tight, up under that light
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer?
She got me windin' up
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer?
Yeah, she got me day dreamin'

Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe
  (Yes, I'm day dreamin')
Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe
  (She got me day dreamin')

Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe
  (Yes, I'm day dreamin')

  (Yeah)

Five foot eight on the late, what a date
She fell for the hook and the bait
I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape

What a night, no more drama, just late night thrills
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz
Fillin' out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville
Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill

Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer?
She got me windin' up
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer?
Yeah, she got me day dreamin'

I'm looking at the most beautiful thang in the world
Her body's so perfect and spinin' like a cinnamon swirl
She looks like a fairy tale but yet feels so natural
This one's a beast but way too wonderful to be compared to an animal
She's like what I'm sippin' on

Shirley Temple on ice, she makes it just right
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her body's so tight, up under that light
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

Hey, I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream
Her and her girls on the stage doin' they thing
Double D's full of silicon and saline
She thirty but look only a day over eighteen

Her booty big enough to swallow up a g-string
Hey, gon' put that ass on me like a bee sting
Hey, let the king on, beat it like a tambourine
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine

Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer?
