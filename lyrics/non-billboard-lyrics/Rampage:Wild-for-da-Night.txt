Wild-for-da-Night:Rampage
It's Atiya, Richard of Flatbush
Speak up
The word on the street is the Rampage return

One time, two times, three times, four times
All my real live soldiers throw your hands up
All my real live women throw your hands up
All my real strong bustas throw your hands up
All my real live players throw your hands up

Check it out, like this y'all
The heavyweight Brooklyn Bomber that can't rest
Love success, I'm gettin' money progress
Travellin' for free from state to state
That's how I get my idea to create
I'm live motivate, I keep on movin', it's been Fubu
I make Def Jams like Rick Rubin
I stay on my tippy toes wreckin' shows, I'm too slow

You can't peep my ill flow in this Burning Zone
Keep low like an Eskimo
Askin' people, still carry my flow, open the do'
It's the real outlaw, from Flatbush to South Shore
Givin' you more and more
I just came home from tour
It's my time to burn to explore
I'm comin' through the floor with Low X

I'm fully gassed to the max movin' stacks, no fakin' jacks
I'm the baddest man on the wax
Messin' around with my Squad, you get taxed
Shittin' Ex-Lax, on hot tracks, I can't relax
Breakin' backs, with my NFL Quarterbacks
Flipmode deep we bring good things to light
Put down your gun and light
I'm in it to win it, plus I'm wildin' for da night

All my muthafuckas in the place to be

I can't help the way I'm feelin'
Caps is fillin', drugs is dealin'
My thug niggas keep illin'
Rampage is higher than the ceiling
Mad appealing brothers who dealin' from Brownsville and
I'm ready and willing I'm playin' lock and chase

You can get my black race
Bet I, hesitates, I'm movin' cash like Chase
You about to get laced fifteen across your face
You at the wrong place, you at the wrong time
You didn't use your third vision mind, you sippin' wine
Your vision is blind, no you can't see the victory
You in the street it's gettin' deep
You rolled up with the wrong peeps, you're the black sheep

You won't protest, drop when your little brother got shot
It's gettin' hot, now you back around the way
With the same clothes, plus your bum hoes that you chose
They gave up your whereabouts, where you hang out
Who you hang wit', now you gotta get your dome split
You wildin' for da night
