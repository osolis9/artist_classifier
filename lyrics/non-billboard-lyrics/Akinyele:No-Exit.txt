No-Exit:Akinyele
I wanna get out this relationship
But I'm scared that my man will flip
He always swears how he's gonna kill me
And fill me with the bullets from his clip

I met her in Queens, her personality was erotic
She asked me where I come from and I just replied, "The projects"
Love at first sight as she was staring
Checking me up and down, yeah, at the gear that I was wearing

I had an office jacket, Polo shirt, diamond on my hand
Stonewashed pants ticked inside of some Timberlands
Her eyes just stayed on my face
She threw her hand on my hip and felt the four-fifths on my waist

Yo, my name is AK
The hard rock shit that shot a cop with a Glock
'Cause he tried to make the money stop
She didn't speak, she didn't start, she didn't talk
All of the sudden, "Let's take a walk through the park"

But it was dark, she didn't bother
She probably thought I was trying to play her out
Like a Central Park jogger
But that's not my style that's what I'm telling ya
Give me your number and I'll probably call you up on my cellular

At night we spoke for hours and hours and hours and hours
Hot convo turned into cold showers
Monogamy, yo, increased to pornography
Miss Astrologist because she looked like a star to me

But I be dressing sharper than those brothers with Farrakahan
Throwing a lucky charm without a leprachaun's arm
Out on the streets dealing and sticking up
I try to make her look appealing, I went out and started tricking bucks

I got her all dressed up, she used to look messed up
Now all of her friends can't wait to be next up
I need to get her thoughts fixed up
She fell into a blender, she got the stuff all mixed up

She caught me talking about a quits
But that's that old bullshit, it's ain't over 'til I say it's over, miss
So if you wanna catch a fit, you catch a melon split
Once you in there, ain't no exit

I wanna get out this relationship
But I'm scared that my man will flip
He always swears how he's gonna kill me
And fill me with the bullets from his clip

I talk a good game of pain
Put it in your ear and let it rain
Benadryl can't stop the migraine
Once my voice touch your brain

So you can talk that fast slang dialect
But I got a tech to keep you in check
Other words make you come correct
Think that to stop giving the loving
You must be smoking pesticide
Because you're damn sure bugging

After one hit, you're ready to split
What, are you test crashing cars?
That's that ol' dum dum shit
You don't flatter me trying to sign off
You best to take the batteries out your watch
If you want some time off

I write my name on your street curb
So you can scratch my letters, girl
If you wanna mark my words
I got the Calimyne beside me

In case you wanna try me
And break out on my ass like poison ivy
You better take it or ease, roll up you sleeves
And prepare to go all out like New Year's Eve

Trying to take my dough like a Swaggart
Girl, I have to bag ya and fall on your head like Niagara
Shit, you're bound to catch it once I start flexing
Ayo bum, bitch, there ain't no exit

I wanna get out this relationship
But I'm scared that my man will flip
He always swears how he's gonna kill me
And fill me with the bullets from his clip
