Say, my jam knocks
We knockin' motherfuckers out they damn socks
Remastered it's the S of the pad lock
Been makin' money, I been had a fat knot

Been loopin' up the shit to make ya head nod
You say my jam knocks
You can hear me coming off the damn blocks
Since a kid I ain't never played wit damn blocks

And I was never ever known to cock block
Like jealous niggas that must wanna get socked
Them niggas make me wanna cop a damn glock
You say, say, say my jam knocks

These ladies know, Jay, can make the bed rock
Be hittin' like bam bam, in bed rock
Compare the S to gators we them big blocks
We stir fry mutherfuckers like a damn wop

Rock and rule niggas like my man mop
So when my band rocks, watch the bands flop
You say my jam knocks
You can say the S is the soul shock

The soul shot known to make 'em shell shocked
When devinous cats used to pop locks
I steal earls, when I used to pop locks
The S twist shit up like a dread lock
You say my jam knocks, you say my jam knocks

So keep ya eyes up
Where you at, where you at, where you at
[Incomprehensible]
Eyes up

Some emcees will never know what we keep on giving and

Makin' music beautiful and we keep delivering y'all niggas to the fall
And I ain't forgivin' it, I should do some ill sh, like, like
Break your ligaments, then you would be feelin' shit
Known to be doing shit and if you do some shit
