'Cause I'm a warrior!
And this is my battle cry
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!

'Cause I'm a warrior!
And this is my battle cry
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!
Warrior!

No horse I'm in the Cadillac
No spur I got a black bat
No cryin' I got my hat back
No job, I got my rat pack and it's like that, yeah

I ain't ask you for your feedback
Or your comments, you hatin' and makin', I don't need that
I see your chest, where that beat at?
No heart, no soul, no gold, believe that

You ain't ready, I can see that
If I have to take the stand, yo', the fifth, I'ma plead that
But for now, mayne, I ain't sayin' nothin'
You wanna keep frontin'? Then I'ma show 'em somethin'

'Cause I'm a warrior!
And this is my battle cry
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!

See I'm a warrior!
And this is my battle cry
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!

See on the real, I think my jewelry's racist
My earrings don't get along and they both hate the bracelet
My chain say my charm be actin' heavy sometimes
They call my watch a mama's boy 'cause it constantly whines

If I told you record sales you would think I was lyin'
Derrty, barely thirty, talkin' 'bout early retirin'
I used to be for real, now I'm just dirty
I just wanted to sell a mil', whoever thought I'd do thirty? Hey

Well maybe I did, but never this early
Every time they doubted me like Tiger Woods
But I kept comin' back like Tiger would
Bangin' them like rival hoods

'Cause I'm a warrior!
And this is my battle cry
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!

'Cause I'm a warrior!
And this is my battle cry
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!
Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, hey!

'Cause I'm a warrior!
