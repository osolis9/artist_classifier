Look-At-Him:Cassidy
I only wear my clothes once. Same day I get some more
Had Nike semi snickers way before they hit the store
(Look at him) Nothing less, nothing more
I'm hopin' out the coup I spent about a hundred for
(Look at him) I've got a house by the shore
And a condo on the tip of the 11th floor
(Look at him) Niggas look up to the bul
And chicks wanna hook up with the bul, look at the bul (Look at him)

I had to switch my language
Robin Lichstal cause I'm rich and famous
People keep tellin' me the streets is dangerous
It is what it is, man I keep mine stainless
My new Ranger's awfly gorgeous
I'm your damn landlord, you payin' the mortgage
The ball rich, you point like a sawfish
Just (look at him) the bul is bullshit
Yea, I had to switch my accent
I'm rich like the late great Mr. Jackson
And I don't think the police could stop me from trappin'
I'm getting rich on the strip making tris actions
Selling crack, that's what's cracking
That's why pockets' fat like rerunning that's what's happening
Real crap, I speak the truth when I'm rappin'
These other cats killers in the booth but they bangin'

I only wear my clothes once. Same day I get some more
Had Nike semi snickers way before they hit the store
(Look at him) Nothing less, nothing more
I'm hopin' out the coup I spent about a hundred for
(Look at him) I've got a house by the shore
And a condo on the tip of the 11th floor
(Look at him) Niggas look up to the bul
And chicks wanna hook up with the bul, look at the bul (Look at him)

I had to switch my slang up
Sign a new record deal, step my game up
It's like the media be tryna fuck my name up
But I remain famous, ain't shit gon change us
I just got the new watch and step my chain up
Swampin' in the rain, tryna step my aim up
Lost any family, we fuckin' the game up
Yup (look at him) that may give him chame up
Yea, I had to switch my style up
You want a hot verse then I'm the person to dial up
Your ringtone rappers ain't hot enough or got enough
Plus, you might've got shot before but ain't get shot enough
At times you ain't got enough rhymes so you out of luck
My money but I still grind like I ain't got a buck
Ridin' in a coup but your roof ain't got a cut
My hand mark, yea I'm raw start cockin' up

I only wear my clothes once. Same day I get some more
Had Nike semi snickers way before they hit the store
(Look at him) Nothing less, nothing more
I'm hopin' out the coup I spent about a hundred for
(Look at him) I've got a house by the shore
And a condo on the tip of the 11th floor
(Look at him) Niggas look up to the bul
And chicks wanna hook up with the bul, look at the bul (Look at him)
