The-Jackal-feat-Dana-Bryant-:Ronny Jordan
Did I ever tell you about that man who changed my life?
The one I thought, oh my Lord, when I saw him walk in the back of that bar
All tall and lean with them broad shoulders, sweeeet lips, I knew
That I had died and gone to Chocolate Heaven

He had a real deep voice, and white pearly teeth
And his shoe was always shining
Long slender fingers manicured perfectly
The man wore 800-dollar Italian suits, straight from
I dunno, what would they call it
Milan or Rome or someplace like that?
I knew it wasn't local
I said, I got to get next to that
I haven't seen him in a long time
My man was so fine
He could get any good girl into trouble
You asked me me what his name was?
Well. . . 'The Jackal'. . . 'The Jackal'. Say. 'The Jackal'. .

He was fat back cat cool
Like a Friday afternoon martini
Chillin' at a quarter after 5
Twist of lime, Coke on the side
The brother loved the high life
Had a Ph.D. in street stride
They called him 'The Jackal'

He was big Mack daddy super black stylin'
A diamonds in the back Cadillac
Fur-lined boards, white wall wheels
Cruise control, built for speed, chrome on evray-thang
And the stereophonic speakers, though he really didn't need them
When they called him. . . 'The Jackal'. Say. 'The Jackal'. .

Fly boy was in the buttermilk, hard
Livin' fast, livin' large, 6 foot 4 and not an ounce of fat!
When women asked, 'is you a frown Cat?'
He said 'My dear, I'm more that that, I'm the frownest of the frown
And in case you hadn't known, they call me 'The Jackal'

Served an 18-year bid
First Riker's Island
Then they hid him in the state penitentiary
Said the charge was Grand Larceny
That was 1975, and today, if he's still alive
He'd be living in the park
Hm. The brother whose claim to fame was that they called him 'The Jackal'
