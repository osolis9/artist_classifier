End-Connection:Jailbird
What is your relation with ones and zeros?
What can we do
when everything is a lie,
an illusion?
Part human,
part machine
the evolution of our mind,
of our dreams has become reality.
Cyberland is nothing more than a collection of fear,
hope and perception.
We don't exist,
we simply denied our existence by connecting to a machine.
Don't look for an answer
simply find a way out
from our addiction
end connection!
