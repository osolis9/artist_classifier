If-We-Give-You-a-Chance:Warren G
Well, kinda hungry, have you eaten? Hardly any
Walking down sunset boulevard's
I had this miner on the lock
She said, that muthafucker look finer than a fuck
But he's an east coast cat, pure jelly ass

Nigga kick a rap that can impress my L.A. ass
Disrespect, when I didn't deserve it
Hey, you acting like earning the best rapper walk the earth yet
(No)

I guess some big tymer tapping her, I huff and puff
Blew her fat rat ass off, blaze her shit, in the face
The most rapper, why she acting like it didn't know
While I pulls up on her Rolls

I gets in it, I'm like bitch it's
Best you write down your number this minute
Catching her going just sparking off
And she came to her sister before the car took off

We know what to do
If we give you the chance you'll fall in love
And all the time won't remain
The way you look your touch is fine
But I won't let you blow my mind

Lodi Dodi, we like to party
My nigga Slick Rick can still rock a party
It was 12:15 when I hit the scene
Fresh out from L.A. touching J.F.K.
I was on my way to go get my bays

I'm a real one from L.A. so I gots to say
I hit my nigga Slick Rick and said I'm in town
Get some Puerto Rican freaks 'cause it's got to go down
So we hit every girl in the N Y C

I'm rush associated so what's up with me
We fucked and flee off the Hennessey
Girl just for me hit 'em all for free
Beyatch

We know what to do
If we give you the chance you'll fall in love
And all the time won't remain
The way you look your touch is fine
But I won't let you blow my mind

What? Fast as suave boss will flip the script
The number one draft pick so the G's is thick
Roll with Rick nigga that'll roll with me
Every man feel free when he making a G

Is money constant? And money all that I see?
I'ma breath this shit money coming with me
What you want with it the boss stay committed
To drunk trying to pive it still I bust the sickest

Check it, reckless major carrots in my necklace
Black lance and go kill 'em with [unverified] shit
Perfect it now the game's obtain and this don pieces eyes
Peel jocking the ring trade the sex face

Baby keep the pace lots to do little time
And is love to make promise you my pearl
Baby this my world and even broke without a dime
You still be my girl, what

We know what to do
If we give you the chance you'll fall in love
And all the time won't remain
The way you look your touch is fine
But I won't let you blow my mind
