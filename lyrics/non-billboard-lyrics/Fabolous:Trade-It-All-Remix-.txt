Fabolous: 
I assumed im so into you 
cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends with you 
when they ask I aint gotta say whom in them interviews 
my sweetthing never believe them rumors that been the truth 
like I had numerous friends its true 
but you was wifey can chase me to a room in a minute boo 
maybe, my sense of humer gets into you 
but girl they can make a perfume from the scent of you 
I wanna take you away for like june and december to 
so what you think about cancun till the winter through 
I dont know what the other consumers you been with do 
I put a days decide to go to blooms and just spend with you 
like any other man I would of zoomed to the clinic to 
now I wanna see if me and my juniors identical 
a dude put a wound on the skin of you 
I swear that everything, that same afternoon he'll be in the news 
feel me? 

(Chorus - Jagged Edge) 
Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything 
All, even give up my street dream 
All, anything to have you on my team 
All, baby girl I'd trade it all 
Even give up my good green 
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring 
All, anything to have you on my team 
All, baby girl I'd trade it all

im there for every eww um and moan 
and make sure when the new hummer roam, the shoes coming chrome 
I aint going buying white yellow and cucumber stones 
that same shit the sewer woman bones 
but life gets gruesome alone 
even though I got that kinda bread that wont matter if a few crumbs are blown 
lights out I flew some alone 
now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone 
mamamia, its you ima phone 
just to erase, all the negative views from your dome 
and I promise this fellas G 
and so can stay in the calm over jealous and drama you telling me 
so mama come yell at me 
so i can put the top down and we can cruise like tom and Penelope 
my charm is a felony 

(Chorus)
