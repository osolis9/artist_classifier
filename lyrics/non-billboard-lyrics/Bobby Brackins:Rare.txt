Rare:Bobby Brackins
[Bobby Brackins:]
All dimes in my celly from Keisha to kelly
Best time on the belly, go dumb make the telly
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready 
All in the fashion, getting lit with lil' Debbie
Alexander McQueen in a bitter machine 
If they purchase like me, then i might just eat it
they say i'm too conceited, i just know that i'm rare 
make them craziest slaps, bitch i go dumb every year 
Gold grill, gold jewels, bitch im stuntin'
shine bright in the light ? dozen
Didn't know me then, then I bet you know me now 
All these motherfuckers wanna be my homie now
Drop top whip, couple new rollies now
real true clique and my niggas hold me down
i need five for a show, i need five for a verse 
and if she choose up i need five out her purse
real thang

Hook:
Too rare don't talk to me 
Too rare bring guap to me 
Too rare don't talk to me
Too rare bring guap to me

[lil'Debbie:]
all main all black
i seen you at the mall at the half off rack
blunt full of OG and a cup full of yak
Don't need a house for less than a stack
Gold teeth gold hair
You ain't from the town then don't go there 
Basic ass bitches ya'll going nowhere 
shinning on you haters with game so rare 
40 in my hand pass a homie the bottle
Do my own thing so I bet yo hoe follow
Mobbin' in the whip and we goin' full throttle 
lean in my cup lookin' like i hit the lotto
They call me Debbie hoe, lil debbie hoe
If you a hating' ass bitch you a petty hoe 
Hot boxin' choppas with my bruh kool john 
fur coat with long nails that glue on

Hook:
Too rare don't talk to me
Too rare bring guap to me 
Too rare don't talk to me
Too rare bring guap to me 

Outro:
Mobbin' in the whip and we going' full throttle 
Full Full, Full throttle 
All in the fashion getting lit with lil debbie

Shinning on you haters with game so rare
