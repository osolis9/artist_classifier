In-Your-Eyes:Phenomenon
If you like us, calling all riders
Roll up beside us, no place to hide us
All freedom fighters, let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous and let's go

Destination for navigation
Man up your stations, feel the sensation
Surround invasion with communication
Move quick, we might avoid contamination

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet
To this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud
Let me show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon

Whoa, open you're soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
and let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Don't let these spiders crawl up beside us
They want to bite us, inject the virus
Raise up your lighters, praise to the righteous
Need you to guide us, get prepared to go

If you like us, calling all riders
Roll up beside us, no place to hide us
All freedom fighters, let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous and let's go

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet
To this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud
and show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon

Whoa, open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
and let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Can't take it anymore
Shake until we move the floor
What are we waiting for? Let's go
Tired of being ordinary
Don't care if there's people starring
I know you said you'd carry me on

I'm not invisible like you
Next time things get a little messed up
I'll shine but I'll never be seen through
I'm fine just trying to wake the rest up

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet
To this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud
and we'll show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon

Whoa, open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
and let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

You move to this phenomenon
You move to this phenomenon
