She-Know-It:Paul Wall
I am not gonna tell you 
You are the baddest girl
You already show it
I am not gonna tell you 
You can get it
You already know it
I am not gonna tell you
You are the one
You already blow it
I am like damn shorty can’t get …
Backing up like that was your man shout it
Drop it low
.. take it back to the ..
Man yeah she knows she is bad
All these hoes be mad
.. her Louis Bag brown she …
The baddest chick .. I eat it in the morning like …
She turn me on the top .. she worked hard
For what she got she earned everything she has
.. she got the bomb and the … that grass is cut
I am ready to get low I ain’t even got …

Chorus
I am not gonna tell you 
You are the baddest girl
You already show it
I am not gonna tell you 
You can get it
You already know it
I am not gonna tell you
You are the one
You already blow it

Shorty I am just saying I admire how you move it
I would be staring when you are moving to the music
Side to side .. all these … you can do the same
If you like it .. show paper I will be … on the free way
Straight to the bed .. boys ain’t tripping

Chorus
I am not gonna tell you 
You are the baddest girl
You already show it
I am not gonna tell you 
You can get it
You already know it
I am not gonna tell you
You are the one
You already blow it
