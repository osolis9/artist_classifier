Broke-the-Rim:Soulja Boy
mixing margiela and some mcm
standin' in the trap jumpin' out the gym
in the kitchen whip my wrist then I swim
fifty bricks later soulja broke the rim

ballin' so hard i done broke the rim
broke the rim, broke the rim
slam dunk, alley oop, broke the rim

mixing margiela and some mcm

mixing margiela and some mcm
standin' in the trap jumpin' out the gym
in the kitchen whip my wrist then I swim
