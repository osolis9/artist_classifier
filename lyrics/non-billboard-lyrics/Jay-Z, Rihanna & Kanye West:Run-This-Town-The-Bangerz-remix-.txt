Run-This-Town-The-Bangerz-remix-:Jay-Z, Rihanna & Kanye West
Feel it comin' in the air
And the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight

We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are

who's gonna run this town tonight

We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
We are, ya I said it, we are
