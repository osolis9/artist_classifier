Real-Thing:LunchMoney Lewis
Oh yeah
When she walked out the door
And you don't see her no more
You know why?
She found the real thing
When she go like the wind
And never call you again
You know why?
She found the real thing
I'ma laugh with her, I'ma cry with her
Grow old with her, prolly die with her
Getting dressed up, getting fly with her
Take her back home, lay by the fire with her
I'll be touching, I'll be hugging, I'll be kissing out in public
Have amazing conversations and I let her pick the subject
Cause she know I got bills, so we born on the budget
Homie I'm in love with her
Uh aha, I'm turning your girl to mine
I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning
I'm turning your girl to mine
Uh aha, I'm feeling on her behind
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
I'm feeling on her behind
When she walked out the door and you don't see her no more
You know why?
She found the real thing
When she go like the wind and never call you again
You know why?
She found the real thing
She need somebody who gon' treat her right
Give her good loving in the middle of the night
You had your chance, but you just ain't her type
You know why?
She want the real thing
You got dreadlocks, I got a fake man
I'm getting laid man, you getting played fam
You got John Lennon, you got Raybans
I'm a superstar, you a superfan
I got satellite, you got basic cable
When your girl in the car she get iced cable
She keep your head in them high notes
That might sound hard to my record label
Uh aha, I'm turning your girl to mine
I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning
I'm turning your girl to mine
Uh aha, I'm feeling on her behind
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
I'm feeling on her behind
When she walked out the door and you don't see her no more
You know why?
She found the real thing
When she go like the wind and never call you again
You know why?
She found the real thing
She need somebody who gon' treat her right
Give her good loving in the middle of the night
You had your chance, but you just ain't her type
You know why?
