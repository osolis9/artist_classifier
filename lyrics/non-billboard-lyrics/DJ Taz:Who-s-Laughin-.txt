Who's Laughin'?
Intro:
Yo, brother Taurius let me get some of that guitar bass, mayn
Yo, and look who's laughin, Ha Ha-ha, Ooh

Verse 1:
Now look who's laughin 
Just another way you braggin
Tatoos like a dragon
Put it all in a little red wagon  
Little Black Riding Hood
Up to no good
Never been no good, this is straight hood
Though, used to sell or make a drug 
Till I fell in love
With my music 
God gave me the talent so I sure wont abuse it (Abuse it?)
Yeah, abuse it
But don't worry it's all for the sake of good
Step up, well I wish you would
Get broke down like a ol' horse
Well a horse is a horse, of course
Feel the treble in my voice
Ping, ping, ping I'm starting to ricochet
Shaking my traps and I'm still getting pizz-ayed
Perhaps, I will come on up
When all them busta ass niggaz will take a nap

Chorus, repeat 2X:
Now look who's laughin
Look who's laughin
With the tatoos like a dragon
Look who's laughin
Look who's laughin
Look who's ha ha ha ha ha

Verse 2:
They call me Taz, and that's my name
I be true to the game
Leavin all hizz-eyes drivin in the rizz-ain
And I told ya, I hold, hold you
Shape you, and I mold you
I be laughin like a hyena
Leave you feelin stupid, all in my arena
Now, I be comin around the mountain, when I come, when I come
Make you feel dumb, when you hear the drums
What was simple, I make it complicated, and  you hate it
Cause, uh, the nigga named Taz made it
And it strictly goes out to the niggaz with the animosity
You can't get rid of me, oh can't you see?
I pledge to listen to the DJ Taz
You better think quizzen, you better think pizzaz
Ain't no man on earth that can discourage me
Handle me, physically, mother fucker can you follow me?

Chorus

Verse 3:
Call me, if you need something to bump to, ooh
This shit is new, just like my shoes
But I can get loose, to break you up
When you come with the cuts
Shake your duff, don't stop till you get enough
Now here I am, the realest man in the flesh
It's no joke, you caught me here with some guests, oh yes
And I come to play, now thank God
I ain't got to kill nobody
I came to get loose, I came to get loose
It's that nigga Taz, who you listenin to
Now who got the scoop, nah, who got the butt
The nigga named Taz, and I'm all in your trunk
Ha ha ha, hee hee hee hee hee
Fly ass nigga, you can't fuck with me

Chorus
