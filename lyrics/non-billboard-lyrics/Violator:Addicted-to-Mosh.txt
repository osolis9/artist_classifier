Addicted-to-Mosh:Violator
Attack!
Thrashers return to this city
To bring back all the insanity
That has been lost through the time
But now is time to remember

Raise your fist and destroy your neck
Against the stage
A feeling inside drives you
fuckin' mad
Dive in the crowd and slam
All around
Adrenalin explodes. Take your life back
In the pit

We Thrash to Live
Addicted to Mosh
We Bang 'til Death
With no remorse
If mania boils in your blood
Then you know it's for real!

Thrash!
Tight pants, denims with patches
Our way, the underground!
We are in league, and we won't admit
Anyone say it as a trend

Raise your fist and destroy your neck
Against the stage
A feeling inside drives you
fuckin' mad
Dive in the crowd and slam
All around
Adrenalin explodes. Take your life back
In the pit

We Thrash to Live
Addicted to Mosh
We Bang 'til Death
With no remorse
If mania boils in your blood
Then you know it's for real!

No breakdowns and no pretensions.
All we want is the Thrashbanger beat
Unstoppable head banging
We're obsessed by old school spirit

Addicted to Mosh!
