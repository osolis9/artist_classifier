Me-U-Hennessy:DeJ Loaf
Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
U, Me, & Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin', my legs keep on shakin'
But my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind lets keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies, and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside, you got me screamin'
You got me, yellin' out yo name oooh I need you
You kiss on my thighs, and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a beamer
Smooth like that henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not going to lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons

Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
U, Me & Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy & U
Aye, this what happens when we drinkin'
Me, Hennessy & U
Me, Hennessy & U
