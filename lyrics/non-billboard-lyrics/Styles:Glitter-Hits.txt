Glitter-Hits:Styles
mama said be nice with cops and policemen be nice with all those kids you hate
your life is not too complicated
you and my guitar too there's nothing to do I wouldn't dare to kiss you, sorry
I just use pick up lines I’m almost divine I never had a look such starry tough decision

YEAH THEY MADE YOU WANT TO LIVE IN HELL
THEY MADE YOU WANT TO HATE YOUR HEAD
THEY MADE YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF
AND IT'S A TOUGH DECISION

Frankenstein around with someone else's mind
he moves and talks just like a tree
don’t you think that he's just like me?
flow as I never grow why can't you be low? I won't jump if I see blurry
now away from the crowd the music is loud I just wanna fuck you birdie tough decision
