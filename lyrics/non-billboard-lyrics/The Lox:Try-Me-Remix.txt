Try-Me-Remix:The Lox
[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body (X2)

[Jadakiss]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I ain't got a problem lettin' bullets fly B
And if you lookin' you know where to find me
Probably on Dyckman with a mami
I don't use them chrome thangs cuz they too shinny
Uh, fuck around and identify me
Need cash up front i don't do consignment
Nah, killin' shit since them niggas signed me
It'll be 10 murda or a yommy
If you motherfuckers try to line me
Calming my self so you can't calm me
More guns than the fuckin' army
When i used to have the BMX with the Knobbies
Selling Coke Just became a hobby
And i ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and have them killers spray you with the shotty
I wish a nigga would

[Sheek Louch]
You don't really want to try me, try me
You ain't see these big gorilla niggas right behind me
Run up on you leave your body layin' in the lobby
Im a rapper but the burner nigga thats my hobby
And i ain't falling for the talking nigga we gone pop it
We gone clap it till the blue shirts try to come and stop it
Where the drugs and all the money that you rap about bro
What models all i'm seeing is a hood rat ho
And i ain't scared i'm a thug until my fuckin' day come
Lox i keep it real with my fuckin' day ones
New York City fuck where all these other rappers come from
Line them up and hit they body with a big chain gun
Ignorant but yeah i'm lovin' all this fucking gun play
Mr.Chow leave your brain all on your chicken satay
D Block you should know them yonkers niggas don't play
It is on until you cowards listen to what the hook say
You don't really want to

Try me
Its mommy and daddy
Getting hommies i be doin' it gladly
Riding in that caddie or that navi
Pop him in the head then i make it my avi
Stompin' on my Nikes like some bruno maglis
First you get the work then you get you the baggies
Try me, I body your auntie
Its Murder Inc. like Ja Rule, Ashanti
Fly me like Gotti Teflon
Lambo 2 Ferarri Its stepped on
Im grimmey its a hommie D Block
They all slump, new pump call Reebok
They know me at the coke spot and weed spot
Get your little cousin killed
Give your uncle some knee shots
So try me, try me
I'll see you be the next dead nigga i throw in my diary
