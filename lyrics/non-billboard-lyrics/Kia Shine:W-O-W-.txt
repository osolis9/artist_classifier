W-O-W-:Kia Shine
Look at my hair, look at my shoes
Look at my jeans, look at my jewels
All you can say is wow, wow
All they can say is wow, wow

Look at my car, look at my style
When I pull up I drive the girls wild
All they can say is wow, wow
All they can say is wow, wow

I ain't playin' dead, it live in the south
It gotta be a lie 'cause it just bought me a house
It just gave me a deal, I'm just 'bout to come out
Shit, I just got my budget and I don't know what they talkin' 'bout

Hip hop bought me this chain, it just bought frosted rings
Shit Memphis, they don't fucked up and let us in the game
Kia Shine, that's my name but you can call me Kinfolk
If it's your first time herein' it, man, this is what you're in for

A laid back flow with a whole lotta' swag
A lot a folks don't wanna see it a whole lotta niggas mad
And I'm just like wow, that's too bad
But now that I'm here y'all can kiss my ass

Look at my hair, look at my shoes
Look at my jeans, look at my jewels
All you can say is wow, wow
All they can say is wow, wow

Look at my car, look at my style
When I pull up I drive the girls wild
All they can say is wow, wow
All they can say is wow, wow

Man, hip hop, I'm trippin', he came to dry snitchin'
He workin' with them people 'cause he see his sale slippin'
He used to watch the Feds, just as you was flippin' weight
Now you can catch a Fed case flippin' mix tapes

Man, I'm just like wow, that shit ain't even straight
I was gone drop mine but I think that I'ma wait
I think I'd rather switch my hustle and flip some real estate
While hip hop trying to hate, I'ma make some realacake

I'ma flip a couple houses, make a couple hundred thousand
Plus to me the mix tape, game too overcrowded
And nothing they can do about it, give my tapes away for free
And put it in your face on my kush DVD
So you can

Look at my hair, look at my shoes
Look at my jeans, look at my jewels
All you can say is wow, wow
All they can say is wow, wow

Look at my car, look at my style
When I pull up I drive the girls wild
All they can say is wow, wow
All they can say is wow, wow

Me and my woman go stunna Louis Vuittonin'
When they come to being fly I ain't talking about nothing
I stay rockin' the best shit, all of the fresh shit
By the time you get on it, I'll be on the next shit

This ain't about hip hop, this about me
Look at my dreads, look at my fresh, look at my mouthpiece
Look at my car, look at my rims
If girls saying shit, cool but she ain't like him

I start a new trend every time I get dress
I write a new hit every time I get fresh
I'm so right now, you so yesterday
Look at me right now, man, I'm so fresh today

Look at my hair, look at my shoes
Look at my jeans, look at my jewels
All you can say is wow, wow
