Black-Dress:New Boyz
[Verse 1 - Ben J]
He wouldn't let her breath
She had to let him go
She was a free spirit
She had to let him know
Her friends were relieved that she was finally free
There were so many things that she could finally see
She ain't know where to start
But knew she start tonight
Her girls said the club
She said she probably might
She always knew she had sex appeal
So tonight she about to dress to kill
Im feelin good, hey

[Chorus]
She finally dropped her man
First night going out without a ring upon her hand
The drinks just kicking in and she feelin good
Especially cuz how she not alone
She spent hours in the bathroom
Just making she tat her hair all good
She can finally show her tattoo
Tonight she don't gotta hide, she's getting excited
Cuz she,
The way you walk in with that black dress [x4]
She finally got it on [x2]

[Verse 2 - Legacy]

She headed back to the mirror
Head over her shoulder and her confidence on 10
Any girl try to step in, it'd be over
She just like a model
Dress from the bottom up
And she feel like the dress too long so she lifted the bottom up
Show them legs girl
You ain't commited now
Them niggas that used to be on you is your victims now
Her ex does not approve
But she always right
She on that weezy shit
Single friday night

Chorus
She finally drpped her man
First night going out without a ring upon her hand
The drinks just kicking in and she feelin good
Especially cuz how she not alone
She spent hours in the bathroom
Just making she tat her hair all good
She can finally show her tattoo
Tonight she don't gotta hide, she's getting excited
Cuz she,
The way you walk in with that black dress [x4]
She finally got it on [x2]
