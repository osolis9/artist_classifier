Peace-of-Mind-Remix-:Darkside Ballaz
i thank god that i found my piece of mind, one more time
since i'm dyin', i'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in
line
repeat
play with mine you'll find that it's the wrong-wrong move
i was the wrong-wrong fool
gino told me do the usual, leave him in critical
my brother bruce told me that he didn't pay dues
you snooze and lose
so what i'd do is make this man take a bath in his shoes
and it was all on the news
see i knew that it would be that me or him gonna bleed
and it wasn't gonna be me
so what i did was popped one up in my (gun click) and i sent 3
no women, no kids
and i'ma shine like mop 'n glo
you think he stopped and load
he jumped down
but he didn't have to be so bold
he rushed the mob like a blob with the -- and more
and even called the cops on score
he be -- with the diamond in the watch in the coat
the medallion to match with the rope
no? in trucks in the cars that he ride
lookin' like a star when he glide
i swear to god when he hear the bullet fall through the sky
he be jackin' like a rabbit tryin' to hide
kinda hard to catch a nigga who be gone in the wind
purple navigator and a benz
a new??, the old niggaz that he used to f**k with
took a fall for??? man
I thank god that i found my piece of mind, one more time
since i'm dyin', i'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in
line
(sko get it) before i step outside and do my job for allah
pray to allah,?? allah
anythang go wrong, i pray to allah
anythang go right, i give my praise to allah
anythang in sight, i'ma bless for allah
everythang tonight, i'ma test for allah
everythang you write, i'ma erase yo bar
if you ridin' tonight, you better hop out yo car
cause the moon tonight is traced in 5-star
i feel for? my sistaz at the bar
y'all be aight, just keep yo self to yo self
y'all can see aight, out on the streets it's double dare

over there it's the end of the road east 99, find my kind
still blind to the times and the signs
all these trick niggaz killin' these?
killin'???
killin' the chief
5 stars in the club with?
everybody gettin' covered up
wrapped up in some bloody sheets
i came off the deep saw throw my heart
niggaz slangin' a v with the l's on the? all the time
since i'm dyin' then i'd rather go right now
than to be waitin' in line
I thank god that i found my piece of mind, one more time
since i'm dyin', i'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in
line
i know who i really need to thank, i knew
for knowledge in this lyrical thang
and my ghetto spiritual brain
and the tv's with the wood-grain frame?? legit ballaz, mobstaz, heavy, and white boy james
really tryin' to do my thang
from how i'm poppin' the flow
i know you know i been smokin' dro
but god knows
that i'm cryin' inside
my daughter almost died and grandmomma done had three strokes
gotta see them both a lil' mo'
but steadily hope is within
i feel the blessin's, lessons of work
demons keep testin' but i'ma keep stressin'
need no heat, the voice is the weapon
for confessions that save me from the hurt
but what if i gotta just put in some work
them desert eagles .30 calibers got us fillin' bodies with
ciphers
nobody don't like us
that's them murderers on 26th and california
and stand out there all the way out to rikers
can't say it ain't righteous, we handle our business
some got away and some die, some caught up in the system
and my lil' brother's just a young and innocent victim
if i depict, i'm on a mission and i miss him
sto said it'll be aight
and lo told me to get a piece of mind
so i broke off a lil' piece of mine
together we become at peace with the rhymes
get in the way????
we live in a world where the haters think they hard
i thank god
I thank god that i found my piece of mind, one more time
since i'm dyin', i'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in
