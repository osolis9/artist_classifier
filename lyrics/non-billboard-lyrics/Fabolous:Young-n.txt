Young-n:Fabolous
Brooklyn, uh uh uh uh
Huh huh uh huh, do it yea
Right now, come on
Uh uh do it huh huh what ya'll want huh

Rollin', gold two seater
Stash in the dash, hole through heaters
Block ah, put holes through beaters
Ghetto fab stroll through cheetahs

Ballin', Brooklyn dawn
Addicted to Cris hooked on Don
15 G's, hookers on
Ma, I wanna see how you look in thongs

Hustlin', guys that send po's
'Cause I chop rocks the size of Mentos
Blame me, I tried to hint those
Look at the hurt in your eyes, they squint closed

Pimpin', here's a new way to flirt
Ya listen to the two way alert
It goes
Let's go VIP boo, raise your skirt

I'm gangsta, ya'll just wannabe's
Federal agents on their P's
30 grand, 28 on the keys
Gotta good lawyer, I'm gonna squeeze

Thuggin' jeans and timb's
Fitted to the front, lean the brim
Ride but never on teenage rims
And I keep a chick's face between my limbs

Stylin' ya'll heard about my kick game
I'm on the park where you see me at the Knick game
Probably seen this tatted on your chick frame
F A B O L O U S

Ridin', ya'll know as well I do
That's the way you can tell I'm blue
So I got a deal, I sell pot too
'Cause before I hit the pens, I'm gettin' bailed by Clue

Cruisin' top down Mercedes low
Turn this up when you hear this on the radio
Blastin' with the nineteen eighty flow
Make the necks on the ladies go
(Woo whoop)

Holla, that's what a pretty thug will do
Hit Branson, get a fifty jug or two
Ya'll throwin' on them gritty mugs for who
Like ya'll don't know what fifty slugs will do

Hatin', I just bought the booze
I put ya'll in the front page articles
I got 'em lookin' at the Billboard charts confused
And I still freestyle just to start the clue's

Rappin' I'm that kid about the dough
I done copped coke and started droughts before
Ship platinum out the door
Now I drop the top down just to shout to hoes

Holla back young'n
