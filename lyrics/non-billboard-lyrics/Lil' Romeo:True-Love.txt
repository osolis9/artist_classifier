True-Love:Lil' Romeo
My heart won't let you go
(Okay, okay)
I love you, Romeo
You my Juliet girl, come on

Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day or memory
I've had since you come my way
I hope you know I'll gladly go
Anywhere you take me it ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

The first time I met you, I didn't sweat you
My Juliet I knew that I catch you
Gave you the key to my heart you unlocked it
A perfect match you the plug I'm the socket
As time moved on we became friends
I knew was love at first sight and it wasn't about the dividends

You was there when I needed you
I remember writing letters on the road I wanna be wit you
I know we young and we got time
Little soldiers need love, so girl, I wanna make you mine
We could row together, go to shows together
My best friend, girl, let's grow together

Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day or memory
I've had since you come my way
I hope you know I'll gladly go
Anywhere you take me it ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

We could walk together rode buses together
Ya mom call us killer bees we stuck together
We at parks play hide-go-seek
I find you or you find me
(You, me)
This was meant to be they call us little one and shawty
Find us hugged up at every school party

We study together, ball together
Somebody said cupid must have brought us together
I love yo cute eyes and you love my tight braids
Play video games almost everyday
And when we not together we on the phone
Talkin' 'bout our first kiss and we don't wanna be alone

Love has truly been good to me
(The way you make me feel has gotta be true love)
Not even one sad day
(The way you make me feel has gotta be true)
Or memory I've had since you come my way
I hope you know
(The way you make me feel has gotta be true love)

I'll gladly go anywhere you take
(Come on)
Me
(The way you make me feel has gotta be true love)
It ain't no limit to this love
(Come on, come on)
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

And I remember so well
How your smile made me feel bright
Like the sun shine I'm so glad that you mine
You my Juliet, I never let the jealous ones
Between and that's a safe bet

And we could get the study in after school
Is over homework is a must
So we can come over and have the words we could
Hit the mall zip ices and cotton candy
And after that come chill wit the family

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm so happy that you came in here and changed my world
Bye bye sadness hello Romeo
Your the only boy that's why solonge is so in love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

Romeo
Romeo
