Word up
New shit, Raekwon, Ghostface
Cream 2001
Fetch out, my nigga RZA
What?

That's right my nigga Clueminatti fuckin' wit the intro
To murder somebody we check-cash niggas wit four fingers on 'em
Callin the Lord, help me, that's us, thrustin' through ya hood wit the dust
Lord have mercy, niggas look thirsty, yo

End the swine, meet the inventor, plus the winter it's mine
Gasoline jump, just spiked gloves, nines
Watch my wave push, one chain faded out
Racin' to Spain, half a million dollars in Boyd

Willy Aims, slap bop top of ya glocks, plus black Reebok
Rockin' real nigga shit, callin' me Pops
Golden pro', kitchen designer shit
Chinchilla blankets, H. Winston anklets on

Drug dealer banquets, hands out, fire when we spit
The position is lit, drop fifty out a blimp
Roast ya ornaments, Super Bowl ring on each finger
Gettin' fly, might linger, those of you ride so let the lye sprinkle yo

Yo, we put together like cream
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler stats, hatin' like Mitch Green
Off the wall auction that dumb out
We organize extortions
Burn niggas labels down, frostin' 'em

Yo we put together like cream

Eh yo, how you like two AC's?
Max in the trunk, lookin' real dumb
Eighty-eight paper and our nose is numb
Prayed over Marvin Gaye's grave
He said ghost, pop merked me at an early age
Hit ninety in the back of me days

There's supreme fingers all on my dick
Loved the way I sung the Cherells
Mercy, mercy, son, made 'em cum
I wrote songs for the people
Verses that'll make Nixon resign
You can do the same thing with rhymes

I swear Ghost is doobie, just imagine, check out what I started
Who's the first to rock 'fros with out a part in it?
Feather hats partin' it, Gladys was the baddest, she wore a six
Pretty-ass foot with an arch in it

Big cars, slammin' eight-tracks, slammin' tracks
King died in sixty-five, Motown cried
Saw a tear drop from Stevie's eyes, fogged out glasses
The plan was to bring together all the masses

Yo, we put together like cream
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler stats, hatin' like Mitch Green
Off the wall auction that dumb out
We organize extortions
Burn niggas labels down, frostin' 'em

Yo we put together like cream
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler stats, hatin' like Mitch Green
Off the wall auction that dumb out

Burn niggas labels down, frostin' 'em

Money Mohamed Ali, niggas who keep clean sneakers on
Beef and take niggas eats, streets brought all my features
Temped to clog bed rallies, imagine only seventeen wildin'
Who spent thousand on 'em Ballies?

Now I'm just lampin', just stylin' out in Cali
Actin' like raw is the mission, mission is to slap 'em
Bang jars, movin' in psalms, manipulatin' my accountant
Relaxin' like blacks get jobs

Slangin' in bangles y'all, chillin' from all angles
Don rock more thank you's, gettin' my shit washed
Elevator music, Rolex doors with thirty-seven whores
Countin the paper, takin y'all to walls

Yo we put together like cream
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler stats, hatin' like Mitch Green
Off the wall auction that dumb out
We organize extortions
Burn niggas labels down, frostin' 'em

We put together like cream
Matter of fact like a Jamaican team
Sprangler stats, hatin' like Mitch Green
Off the wall auction that dumb out
We organize extortions
Burn niggas labels down, frostin' 'em
