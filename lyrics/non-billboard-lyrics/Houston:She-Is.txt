She-Is:Houston
Yeah, you are my love
Check it out

Yeah, baby, whoa, ooh
Baby, only you can touch my soul
To feel a feelin' that words cannot express
Lost in deepest of love like Heaven above

She is
(The moon, the stars, the light, the dark I see when she is here)
She is
(The air I breathe, the one I need in order to proceed)
She is
(The wind that blows, my heart that beats in her body, you know)
She is
(The moon, the stars, the light, the dark I see when she is with me)

My love, feel me

Emotions make me love you
Got to let yourself go, lose all control
Look into your eyes, make sure you're alright
Tears cry likewise tonight

She is
(The moon, the stars, the light, the dark I see when she is here)
She is
(The air I breathe, the one I need in order to proceed)
She is
(The wind that blows, my heart that beats in her body, you know)
She is
(The moon, the stars, the light, the dark I see when she is with me)

Baby

Girl, I live for you, I'd be there for you, I would die for you
I'll fight for you, don't wanna lose you 'cause my love is true

Baby

Girl, you don't know what you mean to me
This is where you oughtta be, yeah

Don't know, whoa, oh

She is

She is
(The moon, the stars, the light, the dark I see when she is with me)
