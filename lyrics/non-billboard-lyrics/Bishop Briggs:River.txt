River:Bishop Briggs
Like a river, like a river, sh
Like a river, like a river, sh
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

How do we fall in love
Harder than a bullet could hit ya?
How do we fall apart
Faster than a hair pin trigger?

Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, dont't you say it
One breath, it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river

Shut your mouth, baby stand and deliver
Holy hands, oh they make me sinner
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Chuck this love till the veins start to shiver
One last breath till the tears start to wither
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Tales of an endless heart
Curses is the fool who's willing
Can't change the way we are
One kiss away from killing

Don't you say, don't you say it
Don't say, don't you say it
One breath it'll just break it
So shut your mouth and run me like a river

Shut your mouth, baby stand and deliver
Holy hands oh they make me a sinner
like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Choke this love till the veins start to shiver
One last breath to the tears start wither
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river

Like a river, like a river, (oh oh oh)
Like a river, like a river, (ooh-oh-oh)
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and ride me like a river

Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh oh oh
(like a river)
Hey, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
(like a river)

Like a river

Shut your mouth baby stand and deliver
(stand and deliver)(
like a river, like a river)
Holy hands oh they make me a sinner
(make me a sinner)
(like a river, like a river)
Like a river, like a river (like a river)
Shut your mouth and ride me like a river
(and run me like a river)

Choke this love till the veins start to shiver
(start to shiver) (like a river, like a river)
One last breath to the tears start wither (oh oh)
Like a river, like a river
Shut your mouth and run me like a river
