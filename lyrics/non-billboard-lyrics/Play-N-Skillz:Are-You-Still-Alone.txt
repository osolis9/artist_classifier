Are-You-Still-Alone:Play-N-Skillz
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Call me a playa 'cuz I crush a lot
And I make that money, 'cuz I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda neva stop

Girl you know what's up
'Cuz I'm still after ya
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone, alone, alone, alone, alone?

So how you doin', how you been and how you livin'?
You know baby girl, your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man wit a game plan
Wit a wedding plan

But you know I'm not the man, I had a different plan
For me and you to follow, a runway model
With a self made balla
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life

You did'nt want no fast life, poppin' bottles err nite
So I get the movin' just like a G should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I cant fuck baby girl, yea, I'm missing times

Creepin' on the low, you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good, we use to freak
And fuck late night in the bak seat
Same number u can call me when u get that urge
Still got 25 cars, money to splurge
(Holler at me)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Call me a playa 'cuz I crush a lot
And I make that money, 'cuz I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda neva stop

Girl you know what's up
'Cuz I'm still after ya
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone, alone, alone, alone, alone?

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin' to figure out who you with, hopefully alone
If thats the case you still got the number to my phone

It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got, I can get that fast
It was something that we had, and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me, let me know I'm on it

I'm still after ya, I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man, understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track, but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was and if your feeling love

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Call me a playa 'cuz I crush a lot
And I make that money, 'cuz I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda neva stop

Girl you know what's up
'Cuz I'm still after ya
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone, alone, alone, alone, alone?

I'm still here, right here, if you wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95
With no strings attached
I'll put you on your back

Do those freaky things, make you always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man, you cant say that your mine
'Cuz I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign

I'm not a ball player
But I'm a balla, playa
And if your still alone
I'll be callin' lata

Call me a playa 'cuz I crush a lot
And I make that money 'cuz I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda neva stop

Girl you know what's up
'Cuz I'm still after ya
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone, alone, alone, alone, alone?

Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not a playa, I just crush a lot
I'm not a playa, I just crush a lot
Girl you know whats up, you know whats up

I'm not a playa, I just crush a lot
Not a playa, I just crush a lot
Are you still alone, are you still alone girl?
