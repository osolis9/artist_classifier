All-My:Buddha Monk
[Chorus (2x): ~Buddha Monk~]
All my niggas, if you with me, with me, with me*
All my honeys, can we get it, get it, get it

[Buddha Monk:]
Where the mami's who don't mind, giving loving anytime
Hit me, hit me, if you with it, with it
Daddy Daddy Warbucks, top dog of this game
Want the, good loving, don't forget the brain
Now scream my name, as the sex enter ya frame
It's the pump to the pump, the pump, the love gang
Get ya head right, Henny and Ali', all night
Bring Sally, it's alright, the more, my dogs bite
I don't care, you got a man, he can join the party too
Two on one, baby, this thug's for you
Now whoa lady, ain't yo man, cause we did the wild thing
Talking styles and dreams and diamond rings
Niggas, I'm bugged out, only wanna chill and bug out
Push in and push out, come in and get out
Respect my game, it's just sex with me and my mans
Ain't no need for holding hand, names ain't calling again
Let's keep it friends, niggas

[Chorus x4]

[Buddha Monk:]
You been warned, baby, hot love in a hot tub
Just five of your broads and five of my Gods
Now let's get it on, take off them thong-thong-thong-thongs
And let Daddy Warbucks proceed to get it on
If getting on is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I want you to, feel good, by the end of the night
I'm a dog by call, not by love at all
These pictures tricks paint, they done paint it in red
Ain't that the nerve of a chick, wanna call you a trick
But she done slept around with Tom, Harry and Dick
Duck down in the car when she saw her man Rob
Ask you to push the six, at an easy hundred clip
She want to be waterbed fed, spread across the bed
With Hot 97 station tuned in the air
Drink the Crystal, so she can sex the extra mile
And give this love with a golden shower now

[Chorus x4]

[Hook: Buddha Monk]
All my niggas, don't tell if you hit it
Oh my goodness, run away if it's kicking
All my niggas, don't be mad if black hit it
All my niggas, hit that ass right with 'em

[Chorus x4]
