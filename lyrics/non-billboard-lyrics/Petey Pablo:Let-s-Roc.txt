This is a Petey Pizzle productshizzle
Thank you, man

Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, squad up
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there

Dawg, you ain't had to worry 'bout us, we wasn't even thinkin' 'bout ya
'Til you went to flyin' out the mouth all cattacornered
Where the fuck did Petey go, one-hit wonder, hell naw
I just been out here up on this horse that I done jumped on

Enjoyin' myself a little bit 'cause I deserve it
Before Saddam and ol' Sadonna Jones supposed to
Get my ass in the Taliban bad ass it's over
Fuckin' up some more planes my taxes pay for

Let me break it down for ya, everythang 'round here
Got Carolina on it bitch, I'm in charge of it
I don't care what shwaty said, security handle that
Before we start to rearrangin' shit up here with his ass

Oh yeah, we can go there, I'm qualified for this here
And certified, downtown, ready to stir it
So before you start to, ease up a little on this here
You gone hate it when I do that right there, right there

Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, squad up
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, squad up
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there

Still off the chain, still in the game
I gotta hear you say it Petey Pab motherfucka
That's right baby, two scoops of raisin'
Half man and half amazin'

This time I got that purple in my haze, candy on my paint
Rocks a little larger on the side of my face
I'm the Mr.Carolina, chair board spokesman
Hail to the King, thanks for your support

If any nigga out there feel that they just wanna kill they self
To run up here and try to take what's mine, let 'em help they self
I ain't got no greaps or gripes, you choose how you lose your life
Gun bustin', knife cuttin', motherfucker fist fight me

Watch how Carolina wild out for they homeboy
Some of them don't like me but they ain't gone let you hurt me
You can bet that there on the left cheek of yo', ass
I'm the fuckin' man 'round here, sound off

Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, squad up
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, squad up
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there

I rep for the prisons, I rap for the block
All my nine to fivers out there workin' jobs
I rep for single parents that don't need they baby daddy
To buy them not nan pamper, show them punk bitches you can handle it

Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Hispanic
Philippine, Dime piece, the white ones and the black ones
Cherokee, Mix Breeds, over here to cross seas
If y'all don't sound off I'm leavin', sweet Jesus

Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, squad up
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, squad up
Let's roc, let's roll, squad up, knock that outta there
