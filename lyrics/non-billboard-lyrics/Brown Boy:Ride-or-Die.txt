Ride-or-Die:Brown Boy
Ride Or Die
(feat.

Nikki Flores)

Baby I'm a be your ride or die
I promise I'm a be there

by your side forever and ever
we will be together

together cause you make me better
I'm gonna ride for you,
I'm a ride for you.

You have been there for me baby throughout the years
all the ups and downs

the blood sweat and tears

you have always been there

right by my side the one and only girl

that's been there to ride
never once baby did you ever say goodbye
not even through the times

when I made you cry
you took it all in stride and
kept your spirits high
that's the reason why I'm gonna love you till I die
till the wheels fall off
until the curtains close
I put it on my life
I will never let you go
you're my angel from above
amor me vida
the one that I love that
I'm always thinking of
me and you girl we can make it through whatever
no matter how rainy or stormy the weather
till death do us part
we gonna stay together
I swear on my life I'm yours forever.

Baby I'm a be your ride or die
I promise I'm a be there
by your side forever and ever
we will be together
together cause you make me better
I'm gonna ride for you,
I'm a ride for you.

I'm sorry baby girl
I done put you through it all;
all them lonely nights
without a phone call
I know it's kind of hard
and your trying to cope
but I can see it in your eyes
you ain't giving up hope
you always kept your head up
and always stood strong
even through them times
when I did you wrong
you're my inspiration
when I can't go on
that's the reason why
I dedicate you this song
when the times get rough
you take the weight up off my shoulders
I salute you girl
you're my ride or die soldier
the air in my lungs
that helps me breathe
I'm gonna love you girl until I D.
I.E.
no matter if the world's coming down on me
I know you will be there to
fight the war with me
I swear to god baby
I'm a always have your back
if my life was a movie
and this the soundtrack

Baby I'm a be your ride or die
I promise I'm a be there
by your side forever and ever
we will be together
together cause you make me better
I'm gonna ride for you,
I'm a ride for you.
Your always gonna be the one for me
I promise to love you for eternity
I give you my heart
I give you my soul
promise me baby
you'll never let me go
cause I need you by my side
I need you here to ride
if I didn't have you I'd probably die.
Baby I'm a be your ride or die
I promise I'm a be there
by your side forever and ever
we will be together
together cause you make me better
I'm gonna ride for you,
I'm a ride for you
