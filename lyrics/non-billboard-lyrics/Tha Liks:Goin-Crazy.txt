Goin-Crazy:Tha Liks
Smokin'
Hey

I'm a lik, your a lik
Everybody on that shit
Everybody wanna get
All fucked up

I'm a lik, your a lik
Everybody on that shit
Everybody wanna get
All fucked up

Ladies shake it up, Mackin'-Ro shakedown
I shake the ground when I roll through your town
I shake my glass of cognac with ice, I shake dice
I shake niggaz with bad advice

Bullet comin' at ya like rice at a wedding
Lace you with a fresh white hospital bedding
Liks are west coast veterans you weak like the Bengals
Soft like mangos and rainbows

I train hos to love me only gotta rub me
I make the whole world wanna pop that bubbly
And by the way, I'm al alcoholic
I act a fool and frolic till I hurl in the toilet

J-Ro dangerously givin' you brain surgery
Like a drunken doctor, drunken mic-rocker
The hos mouth smell like cock, uh
I should sock ya and lock ya in a room with nothing but bread and vodka

Ha can't you see
I'm losing my mind, goin' crazy
Over this hip-hop, hey
Can't you see that
I'm losing my mind, again
Say what?
Over this hip-hop, hey

I'm back at ya, Catashtra
Spy master with a deuce,deuce
I bump heads with rappers tryin' to knock them niggaz screws lose
So come watch the fireworks, believe me it's a trip
While Tash will fry ya extra crispy, like Stevie's on the strip

I never rap typical, I might change the topic, though
Rap about the ghetto then I switch to something tropical
Fuckin' wit ya opticals I jump right out ya screen
Make your woman do the splits, put a rip up in the jeans

'Cuz Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
But I be fuckin' with his dimes on the billboard signs
Rhymes shine like spotlights on inmates at San Quentin
E-Swift bang the tracks, make the hottest jams written

Sittin' in the dark flows spark the light
If you drunk while you rappin' time to park your mic
It's like this, muthafuckers time for all y'all to peep the flow
Y'all goin' crazy now I lost my mind like 3 weeks ago

Feelin' like a UFO everybody stop and stare
Fresh out the chair on 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'
Time for us to take it there peep what we showing you
You goin' crazy now we know what the fuck you goin' through

Can't you see
I'm losing my mind, goin' crazy
Over this hip-hop, hey
Can't you see that
I'm losing my mind, again
Yo
Over this hip-hop, hey

Yo, Swift twist the beat that hit hard like Tyson squabbles
Ain't a drunk, my motto rowdy as the game module
Me and my apostles, puff and breathe through nostrils
Honeys peel Milano wanna ride this colossal

Might find me and Tash, in a green El Dorado
With some models that gobble, south-side Chicago
Might be poppin' bottles Rocky Mountains, Colorado
Or Harlem world poppin' collars up in the Apollo

Goin' crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Them niggaz lookin' jealous 'cuz y'all niggaz can't blaze me
Page me on battle night we'll do it via satellite
Channel 2, pay per view, I'll serve you without a mic

Leave your eyes without a face, disappear without a trace
Last seen in outer-space, you all in court without a case
Don't fight it the Liks is united
They say we broke up but every story's two-sided

Can't you see
I'm losing my mind, goin' crazy
Over this hip-hop, hey
Can't you see that
I'm losing my mind, again
Over this hip-hop, hey

Niggaz goin' berserk
Yeah, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh-huh
Niggaz need, niggaz need a new drug
One that don't make ya sick
One that don't make ya throw-up
One that don't make ya sleepy
One that don't make ya beat up on your kids
