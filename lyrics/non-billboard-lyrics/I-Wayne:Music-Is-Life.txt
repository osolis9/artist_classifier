Living In Love

I wayne

I love to see my people living in love
I hate to see them fighting and swimming in blood
Nuff neglect the farming, the scorn in the mud
Yet they want to be the first to reap the fruit as it buds
Oh, they fill the earth with prison, church, and whore house
Love the rum bar, yet they hate the pure house
Dem take the microchip and override the poor out
Less food, more shout and more mouth

Rasta tell dem all the while
Stop war and the killocide
Stop fighting for land and oil
Fi be kind so many go to?
Take master spit inna dem face take back dem teet and smile
Da bounce of the nile so mile and so fertile acres more than ah zillion mile
People acting vile pick up cannibal style
wan devour mama, papa, and child, oh

So life see it and mek it buss har
dem sey dem ting dem tek too long fi grow and start to cuss har
I couldnt trust him and those as how I trust har
Such is life, dem say ah just her
I see Kosha hide so dem call di spot Iran
Some sey fi government, some sey fi matter land
Still no wan share although dem gotta lot ah land
Dem wan fi turn ah gun range and shot Iran.

Rasta tell dem all the while
Stop war and the killocide
Stop fighting for land and oil
Fi be kind so many go to?
Take master spit inna dem face take back dem teet and smile
Da bounce of the nile so mile and so fertile acres more than ah zillion mile
People acting vile pick up cannibal style
wan devour mama, papa, and child

Politician ah talk certain tings dem nah mention
Sey ah drugs and gun people tax money spend pon
Come wit plastic smile and dem wicked intention
Inna ya hand, is where dem put dem evil invention
Turn gun model seeking attention
See it deh now ya dead and it is no redemption
Parents ah wonder where to get the first cent from
To bury the dirt dem not even got pension

Rasta tell dem all the while
Stop war and the killocide
Stop fighting for land and oil
Fi be kind so many go to?
Take master spit inna dem face take back dem teet and smile
Da bounce of the nile so mile and so fertile acres more than ah zillion mile
People acting vile pick up cannibal style
wan devour mama, papa, and child

Rasta tell dem all the while

Da bounce of the nile so mile and so fertile measures more than ah zillion mile
