Keep-On-Dreaming:Heat
Every time I think of all those days we could have had
I get that feeling that its time to leave this town
words makes no difference you can never reach the past
dare brake the silence I'm a generation lost
Give me the lust and fire
give me the strength of desire
show me the way

I always say keep on dreaming
someday you will find out
Maybe today you'll get that feeling
and you will know what it's about

Every time I dream about those gleaming glory days
I really overload and push my limits free
I feel the hunger for the legacy of vengeance
the sound that brakes the silence
is the answer to my prayers
