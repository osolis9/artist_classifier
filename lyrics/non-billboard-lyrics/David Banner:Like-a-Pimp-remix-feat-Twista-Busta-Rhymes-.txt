[David Banner]
Make them girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (3x)
[Lil Flip]
Like a Pimp
[David Banner]
Make them girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (2x)
[Lil Flip]
Like a pimp
[David Banner]
Make them girls get down on the flo', on the flo' (2x)

[Lil Flip]
By the time I hit the door
I saw hoes on the flo'
Niggas dressed in suits
Tricking all they dough
Me I'm a pimp
I ain't paying for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car
Or a new Rolex
Cause I got street fame
So hoes flock like birds
I got one hoe in the range
And another in the surbs'
When I hit the club
Imma be wit David Banner
A thug ass nigga
Wit bad table manners
We act bad (my nigga what is y'all saying)
Like when we walk inside clubs
Niggas hold they gal's hand
Cause they know we run trains (choo choo) all night
How could yo gal leave me
And be wit you all night
But it's all right
Cause you know we don't kiss
Like Too $hort said
Bitches ain't shit
I tried to told ya
That most girls really freaks
And dis is how they gotta
Make they money every week

(Chorus: repeat 4x)
Real girls get down on the flo' on the flo' (2x)
Like a pimp

[David Banner]
Step into club looking just like a pimp
We got cash so we screaming out "shake something bitch"
This is your song
Tell the DJ put it on
Micheal Tyler made you shake
Sisqo made you show your thong
Bitch I'm dead wrong
The playa from the crib
So get out on the flo'
And girl get it how you live
And since you so hot (hot)
Then show yo pussy lips
You go to Tugallo, but I know you still flip
Bitch don't trip
Ain't a damn thang changed
I still love my queen
But bitches keep me to the game
So if you gotta hoe
Shake 'em up and let em go uhh
And let them girls get down on the flo' on the flo'
Like a Pimp

(Chorus)

[Lil Flip]
Now don't you hate them ole'
Lying ass hoes
Smiling in your face
Wearing her best friends clothes
I suppose
They like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Poppa Do's
Eating steak and shrimp

[David Banner]
Or you can catch us at E&J;'s pouring it up
Flip whipping Cali trucks
Guls licking my nuts
We some south side pimps
And we ain't giving a fuck
Fuck yo gul up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut

[Lil Flip]
We make em
Swallow the nut so
Follow the truck
Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks and
All of they sluts and
All of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot girl
Touch yo fucking toes
Oohh

[David Banner]
Gone touch yo toes and
Make me a roll and
Gone hit the mall
And buy me some clothes mayne
And if yo boy trip
Imma bust a clip
Y'all bitches can't fuck wit me
And

[Lil Flip]
