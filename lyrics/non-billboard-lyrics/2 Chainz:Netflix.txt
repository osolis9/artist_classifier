Netflix:2 Chainz
feat. Fergie


[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I smoked a blunt for dinner, another blunt for breakfast
2 Chainz! Got 'em staring at my necklace
Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix
Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix
She got it, I want it, I want it, she got it
I'm dodging paparazzi, my outfit from Versace
Copy, copy, all these niggas just copy
I just bought me a new watch and these new niggas just watchin'

[Hook x2: 2 Chainz & Fergie]
I know you had the time of your life
I know you had the time of your life
You know I'm gettin' money, ten, twenty, thirty, forty
I'll be countin' this shit all night

[Verse 2: Fergie]
When I die, bury me inside the liquor store
Cause when I die, Fergie still gon' be gettin' dough
You do what you can, I do what you can't
You smoke that Bobby Brown, we on that Shabba Ranks
I got it, you want it, you want it, I got it
My girls go shopping, that ain't a mall, that's my closet
So copy, copy, all these bitches just copy
Honor student wit' double Ds, that ain't the bra, that's my ta-tas

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'm gettin' to the monies with an apostrophe
Fucked her on a pile of clothes now she a closet freak
Yeah I bear arms, I got something up my sleeve
And when she wit' me, she don't wanna leave
She just wanna freak, she don't wanna sleep
Put it in her mouth now she don't wanna speak
Yeah I'm at the club, I got strippers at my table
I call doin' the 69 a favor for a favor
From the cradle to the grave, shoot a nigga from his ankle to his waist
You can tell that I'm paid cause I'm high-class
Fucked a bitch in her eyelashes, we in a jet, who gon' fly past us?
Tint all on my eyeglasses, I don't see ya hater
And bitch I don't get dropped, bitch I drop the label
Goddamn!
