Check-On-Me-Feat-Future-:DJ ESCO
[Intro: Future]
I'ma tell y'all how serious it's gettin'
Super mothafuckin' Future
DJ Escomoecity, the coolest DJ on the mothafuckin' planet

[Hook: Future]
Audemars the whip when I ride through
And I had snatched two Rollies
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high and I'm rollin'
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high, no focus
I got a check on me right now
And all my cards loaded
I got a check on me right now
See my watch is loaded
I got a check on me right now
All these hoes bogus
I got a check on me right now
I got a check on me, nigga
I got a check on me right now
I got a check
[Verse 1: Future]
They tryna tell me to turn down, I refuse to do it
They tryna tell me I'ma lose, I'm the undisputed
I just did a walkthrough and I bought a Cuban
Bunch of fake lawsuits, my attorney Jewish
I just bought a Benz with a walkthrough
And I had snatched two Presis
I'ma floss so you can see it, make your ass regret it
I'ma hit the pussy on the first night
Then I'm gonna snatch that Rollie
I got the streets on dynamite
I'm 'bout to cause an explosion
I'm 'bout to flex on 'em soon as I see 'em
They better know that I'm chosen
You see my watch and my chain and rings
Everything frozen
You see my face on the magazine
I'm gettin' global exposure
I count it up like a money machine
Then I get ready to blow it

[Hook: Future]
I done bought a whip with a walk through, hold up
And I had snatched two Rollies
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high and I'm rollin'
I got a check on me right now
Bitch I'm high, no focus
I got a check on me right now
And all my cars loaded
I got a check on me right now
See my watch is loaded
I got a check on me right now
All these hoes bogus
I got a check on me right now
I got a check on me, nigga
I got a check on me right now
I got a check

[Verse 2: Future]
I might just post in the projects
Then I go hop on a private
We doin' this like a drug deal
Baby we gotta be private
I'll let you play with a couple mil'
Baby you gotta be silent
I know the streets like the back of my hand
Finessin' in violence
We see a half a mil' a show
Soon as a quarter deposit
I sent ya Rollie for me and my hoe
Then I went copped the Ferrari
I bought a A.P. for me and my brothers
Them lil niggas the Maserati
I gave the chain to somebody dame
The killers they gotta be quiet
I hit the stage, they feelin' my rage
And it's causin' a riot
I got a four door, Mercedes, a Maybach
And I don't get to drive it
See where I'm from, you know what I been through?
It's very surprisin'
We get money comin' in like this
It's hard to hide it
