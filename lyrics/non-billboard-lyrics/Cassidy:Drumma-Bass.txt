you can hate it so good in the hood im great
i was never fake
early like ive never been late
im never sober. smoking marijuana to the face
sippin some champagne you probly never get to taste
cuz you cant afford it. if you order by the case
for the watch i paid a quarter
frozen water in the face

i know its a recession and a lot of people down
but imma keep to pushin
i aint got a bush to beat around
im with some freak i found,
dancin with my hands on her hips
imma take her home and let her dance up on my dick



Listen Im on a mission to get richer and richer
my life like a movie
but you aint getin the picture

cuz when you gone god aint lettin you bring it with ya
i wish i could rewind time and be young again
take it back to when cats was dancin havin fun again
and get it jumpin like house party one again
if u aint dancin U aint comin in.
