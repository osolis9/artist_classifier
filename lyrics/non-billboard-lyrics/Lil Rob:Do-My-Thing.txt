Do My Thing



This is Lil' Rob
Lil' Rob comin at you with my own style
You wanna know about me look me up in the gang file
And you will see just how I'm living
I didn't choose nothing because the choice wasn't given to
A little vato going a little fuckin loco
Was just out of hand, not poco
Because all these vatos talkin shit about a homey
When they don't even fuckin know me
They said they kicked my ass, they say I got shot
But when I heard that I started laughing on the spot
Cause what the fuck is that all bout
They say I'm dead so I had to put this tape out
To let these levas know they're all about bullshit
And that these vatos got to quit while they're ahead
Before they look stupid
You say you don't talk shit but I know you did
So you put a filero to my neck you fuckin LEVA
What the fuck's next? A cuete to my head did I cry?
I'm not afraid to die and when I do I die with Brown Pride
I got a pussy ass voice so you say
But you listen to it anyway
You say I can't rap but where the fuck are you
Just keep talking shit cause that's what little kids do
So remember this line for the first time
You do your thing holmes, but I'ma do mine
Now fuck that shit up

{Chorus)
"Doo Wah Ditty"

Lil' Rob not even puttin' in one hundred percent
But if I did you know that no one could get close
Because I'm the man with the most
Don't brag or boast but I'm a vato from the West Coast
Southern Califa's down for the Brown thing
And San Diego is the name of the city that I was brought up in
But the gang life I was caught up in
Started backin' little levas every weekend 
Yeah I know I'm skinny but I ain't down for the tweakin'
Go off smoke marijuana; si mon the Mary Jane
God damn but I don't use God's name in vain
So I take that back ese con respecto
Cause I got respect, something you'll never get though
A little vato now seventeen with a glock
I got my finger on the trigger, not afraid to pull it ese
So don't tempt the man behind the gun
Because this vato might have you on the run
And at the same time cryin, shoot down your legs
but holmes is still tryin to get away
But hell ya gotta pay
Pump the fucker back and let the shotgun spray
Until you lie there dead
Just for talkin shit you got a bullet in your head
So if you persist to go on with the shit talkin
You best keep walking cause this vato's gonna be stalking your ass
Harassing it more than the hura
Or maybe not the hura pero homey keep trucha
Or better yet just don't fuck around ese
Cause I don't like killing off the Brown ese
So remember this line for the second time
You do your thing holmes but I'ma do mine
