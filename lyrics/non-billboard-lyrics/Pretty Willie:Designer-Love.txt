Designer-Love:Pretty Willie
[Chorus x2]
She want a lot of love
But his ballin' got your hand with that designer love
And I wanna change your world
But you're such a material girl

Now I done seen so many girls
Let a man come in and change their whole world
Okay I know you like nice things
But there's more to life than cars and bling bling
Oh yes I know he gives you cash
But without the love this thing won't last
Oh he okay when you let him smack
But when you ain't in the mood he treats you like
trash
First date, fancy places to eat
Second date, he took you on a shopping spree
Third date, you realized you wanted me
Ninth minute after six your body's calling me

[Chorus x2]
She want a lot of love
But his ballin' got your hand with that designer love
And I wanna change your world
But you're such a material girl

She want a
Designer Love
She want a
Designer love

Now I recall meeting you
While you were down and out and feeling so blue
So I listened to you
As you explained the things your man won't do
But I didn't have much cash
For the Gucci clothes and the Coach bags
But I did more for you
I mean I held you close and talked to you
First date, we got some fast food to eat
Second date, I listened while you talked to me
Third date, you realized you wanted me
It's best if you envy nothing if you're there for me
(There for me)

[Chorus x2]
She want a lot of love
But his ballin' got your hand with that designer love
And I wanna change your world
But you're such a material girl

[Omaze]
Dressed to impress
But she had to confess
The simple ways that we kicked it
Relieved our stress
Oh yes, I brought you joy
Laughed and took your hand
While he, he ignored you
Gave your love the name brand Prada and Gucci
Don't forget about Chanell Armani to Versace
Covered her body so well
True enough she from the block, past life, was slum
Bad hair, high school days a tireless bum
Swooped after graduation
By a big time hustler
And it was no more days of cold wings and brussels
It's like, no finance and no romance
But see, deep in her heart a hood realla still stood a
chance

[Chorus x2]
She want a lot of love
But his ballin' got your hand with that designer love
And I wanna change your world
But you're such a material girl

She want a
Designer Love
She want a
Designer love

[Chorus x2]
She want a lot of love
But his ballin' got your hand with that designer love
And I wanna change your world
But you're such a material girl
