Box-of-Money:Mavado
Pounds and US no pense
Spend a couple Jeeze
Mi money tall like trees
Rims dem chrome pon di benz

Weh mi say?
Box a money, box a money
Julian with the white sox a money
Yuh si mi natty tall
You know mi lox a money
If you trail mi, mi traxx a money
Every ghetto yute
Box a money, box a money
Every year how mi pay mi tax a money
So mi pree before mi stocks a money
And a say mi have docs a money

When you si mi old then you si yuh rich a show
Pure don inna di dance and have money a dash out
check mi bank account dem you know mi nuh crack out
The amount can't count

Mi haffi rich before mi reach sixty
Sixty, mistake mi mean fifty
when mi reach eighty young gal a date mi
Why?, mi bank account weighty

Ehhh, a every ghetto yute idol
So mi money bank more then the Brink arrival
Without the money there is no survial
So mi say...

Box a money, box a money
Julian with the white sox a money
Yuh si mi natty tall
You know mi lox a money
If you trail mi, mi traxx a money
Every ghetto yute
Box a money, box a money
Every year how mi pay mi tax a money
So mi pree before mi stocks a money
And a say mi have docs a money

Everything concrete show money mek mi see it
Money stick on like bong-crete
Half a mill inna di street
Toppa Geeze ask fi it
Ghetto yute, spread off like white sheet
First wi make the paper fi own the acres
Money mek some tun shake
Anyway tell you bout that later

So mi say...
Box a money, box a money
Julian with the white sox a money
Yuh si mi natty tall
You know mi lox a money
If you trail mi, mi traxx a money
Every ghetto yute
Box a money, box a money
Every year how mi pay mi tax a money
So mi pree before mi stocks a money
And a say mi have docs a money

yuh see it dutty
Box a money
