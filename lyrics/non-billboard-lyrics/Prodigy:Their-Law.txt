Their Law
(Featuring Pop Will Eat Itself)

What we're dealing with here is a total lack of respect for the law.
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck 'em, and their law.

Halt!
Halt!

Crack down at sundown.
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck 'em, and their law.

Crack down at sundown.
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck 'em, and their law.

Halt!
Crack down at sundown.
Halt!

Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck the law, but you can't beat the law,
Fuck 'em, and their law.
