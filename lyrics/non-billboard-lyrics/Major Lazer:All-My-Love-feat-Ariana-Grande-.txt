All-My-Love-feat-Ariana-Grande-:Major Lazer
Ariana:
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

ALL YOUR LOVE will make us ache
ALL YOUR LOVE is worth the chase
ALL YOUR LOVE I know we're waitin' for this
ALL YOUR LOVE's up on the mountain top!
ALL YOUR LOVE
ALL YOUR LOVE
ALL YOUR LOVE
Up on the mountain top!

Ariana:

We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

ALL MY LOVE will make us ache
ALL MY LOVE is worth the chase
ALL MY LOVE I know we're waitin' for this
ALL MY LOVE's up on the mountain top!
ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
Up on the mountain top!

ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
Up on the mountain top!

You're always on my mind,
Oh, there'll come a day,
Day where we can fly,
Reach the glory gaze
High, up in the sun and brighter the sky,
Sun and brighter the sky

ALL MY LOVE will make us ache
ALL MY LOVE is worth the chase
ALL MY LOVE I know we're waitin' for this
ALL MY LOVE's up on the mountain top!
ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
Up on the mountain top!

ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
ALL MY LOVE
Up on the mountain top!
