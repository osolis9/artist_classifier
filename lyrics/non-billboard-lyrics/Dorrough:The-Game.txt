The-Game:Dorrough
Now I came in this game without nothing to lose
Nothing to worry bout, nothing to prove
Currently, permanently, paying my dues
And continued this path I decided to choose
From this moment on I’ll be changing the rules
Fuck what you heard, I didn’t come here to lose
Hungry as fuck and I see you as food
I will make you a victim as soon as you snooze

[Hook:]
Bang, bang, this is the game
Here to contest you and put you to shame
Bang, bang, this is the game
Before you can shine, you must go through the rain

The mountains I climbed, the water I coast
No sympathy I got the heart of a ghost
It’s easy to brag, but it’s harder to boast
Don’t be fooled by the hype cause I’m smarter than most
Of y’all
Way up there ain’t nowhere close
To y’all
Made it this far I was s’posed
To fall
That’s what they told me but yet no one showed me
Now I realized that I am the one with the…

Bang, bang, this is the game
Here to contest you and put you to shame
Bang, bang, this is the game
Before you can shine, you must go through the rain

So…
That’s why niggas be fadin’ on me
Why so many be hatin’ on me?
You just mad that I made it homie
I can tell that you hatin’ homie
You ain’t goin’ nowhere and you wonder why
I’m on I got the heart of a summer (ride?) Ha.

And that’s why…
Niggas be fadin’ on me
Why so many be hatin’ on me?
You just mad that I made it homie
I can tell that you hatin’ homie

See the light girl? Believe no mistake it
Don’t take it for granted and never forsake it
You ain’t got the patience to make it and take it you won’t

Now I'm ‘bout to take off like I’m boardin’ a plane
And I don’t give a fuck if you feelin’ me
All I know is I'm runnin’ this game
Get me stronger, whatever ain't killin’ me
Best believe that I'm killin’ my enemies
Fuck you haters you niggas ain't kin to me
Don’t know why I be wastin’ my energy
But I do know you finna see me…

[Hook:]
Bang, bang, this is the game
Here to contest you and put you to shame
Bang, bang, this is the game
Before you can shine, you must go through the rain

Now, don’t nobody be holdin’ me, I
Call my shots and I do what I wanna do
Ain't nobody controllin’ me, No
I was put here to do what I come to do
Don’t know what this hip hop game is comin’ to
But I'm one of the ones that it’s running to

Go ‘head and envy me, this is the industry)
