[Verse 1: George Maple]
Touch of your skin
Blurring my vision
Seeing the same film again
Closer you pull me
Under the table
Sign of how this might end

[Pre-Chorus: George Maple]
But if you don't want to hold me
Maybe I can change your mind
Cause I'm waitin', hesitatin'
And it's other ways to leave it
But I've only asked for you
As you move your body next to me
There's so much more to lose
[Chorus: George Maple]
When you talk, talk
All you wanna do is talk, talk
All I wanted was, all I wanted was
All I wanted was your reckless heart

[Breakdown: George Maple]
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
Tal-al-al-al-al-al
