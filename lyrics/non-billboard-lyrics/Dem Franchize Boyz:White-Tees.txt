White-Tees:Dem Franchize Boyz
I slang in my white tee
I bang in my white tee
All in the club spitting game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee serve feigns in my white tee
Fuck a throwback i look clean in my white tee
[Verse 1]
Step on the scene with some green and some hard white work
Real clean fresh jeans and a all white shirt
We all get money and we all smoke purp
Hit the dirt one squirt will leave all yall murk
Cause im fresh in my white tee they glance at my white tee and i
Got the hat that match my pants and my white tee
Whoever that you might see

Uncle, brother, sister, mother, dad or ur wifey
Hanes or fruit of the loom be the
Name of my white tee

Lames in a white tee i bring the pain in my white tee
Hispanic cracka nigga even yangs wearin white tee
Hit the club deep and we all got a white tee
A throw back no that hell naw it dont excite me

Tee you can get a circle or a v neck on ur white tee
