High-Off-Life-:Kid Cudi
[Verse 1]
New York loft to the condo in Chicago
Out in LA I got the house in the hills
Hand out the window feel the wind on my fingertips
Cruisin' cruisin' I'm on my way
Searchin' searchin' I need to find some more of it
New things and new places to go
Fiendin' fiendin' oh I want another hit
It takes me up and I never come down

[Hook x2]
I never ever thought it could be
Never thought the day would come for me
When I would be high off life
Oh there's so much I haven't seen

[Verse 2]
Hey mama I'm livin' la vida
No need to worry bout' your baby no more
I am feelin' the rush, takin' hits up off of experience
Floatin' floatin' I am on my way
Searchin' searchin' I need to find some more of it
New things and new places to go
Fiendin' fiendin' oh I want another hit
It takes me up and I never come down

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Help me (x6)
I'm OD'in off the life
Say it
Help me (x6)
I'm OD'in off the life
Say it
Help me (x6)
I'm OD'in off the life
Say it
Help me (x6)
I'm OD'in off the life

[Hook x4]
