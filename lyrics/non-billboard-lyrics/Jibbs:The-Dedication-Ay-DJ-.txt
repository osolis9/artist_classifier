It ain't nothin' like the old days
Listenin' to them old days
Then while you roller bladin'
While listenin' to O.J's

I remember that night in prom
When they played our favorite song
In the back of my jeep first time
You told me you wanted to bum, bum, bum

Foggin' up the windows, writin' my name in it
Now the days passed, it ain't the same, is it?
Do you remember that, yeah, I remember too
So turn your speakers up, this next one's for you

My shawty's on her way home from work soon
And I'mma do it like we did it in high school
And send my dedication on my favorite station
