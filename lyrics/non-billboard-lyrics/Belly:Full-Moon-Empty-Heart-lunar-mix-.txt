Sleep in now now
Sleep in now now now
It's still night out
Sleeping

Don't look at me, looking back at you
Out the window backwards
Out the window backwards
Sleep...

See this child twisted over from me
At the window backwards...
At the window backwards...

Sleep in now now
Sleep in now now now
Sleep now

Now fall to the bed
Put your hand in your hair
Then now fall to the tile
Stick your finger in your eye
(That's the only way you cry)
Now, now

Full moon pass the wind outside waves
Hee now, hee hee now
Sleep in now now
Sleep in now now
Sleep in now now
Sleep, sleep, sleep...
