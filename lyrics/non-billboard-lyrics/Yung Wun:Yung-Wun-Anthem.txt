Yung-Wun-Anthem:Yung Wun
Callin' all cars, callin' all cars, uh uh, Yung Wun in here
Callin' all cars, callin' all cars, back up, back up, back up
(We gotta problem)

Time and time again, I try to be on the good foot
But ladies don't be given me good look
It's hard when you livin' like us, I started the good book
It's just what I see that got me shook

Mean mugs and cold stance take a nigga down
And to make him fail, I'mma take it to you how
Lights out, closed casket, murder warn
Yung Wun come through with the under grudge

And live the life, Yung talk about it
Don't make beef, come walk about it
Everybody know my name because I play in the street
Not because I say I'm street, mutha fucker

All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
Now I don't give a fuck, if ya'll don't give a fuck
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
All my niggas is star [unverified]
Well, I don't give a fuck if ya'll don't give a fuck

They all try to sound like Pac, I don't know why, hoe
Sounding like Pac is a position you shouldn't try, fool
They don't understand what they die for
And tell lies about black folk, and take from they own folk

That type of shit heavy poppin' through the stove
'Cause you don't wanna show your face 'cause it's a known place
And I don't love her face when she take from me man
And I don't give a fuck what you think of me

'Cause what you think of me is nothin' but a mere decision
And they shipped my ass off ta prison
If I die than death is a given and if I live let me enjoy living
That's a wonderful feeling

All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
Now I don't give a fuck, if ya'll don't give a fuck
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
All my niggas is star [unverified]
Well, I don't give a fuck if ya'll don't give a fuck

All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
Now I don't give a fuck, if ya'll don't give a fuck
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
All my niggas is star [unverified]
Well, I don't give a fuck if ya'll don't give a fuck

As a kid I had no love for life
Everything I've done [unverified] they said it wasn't right
It doesn't matter hustlers scatter, everyday from 12 in the A T L
So love is like the wind blowing cold off the scale

Tell me what's going on, two wrongs don't make it right
But I know two holes in your dome will take your life
I'm on the precious shorty, they coming after what I treasure
It's time we start renting out yachts

Yung Wun yacht masters ship out blocks
Hold my block why'll I hand out glocks
Send the niggas over the hill
When they done, go pop somebody for show

All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
Now I don't give a fuck, if ya'll don't give a fuck
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
All my niggas is star [unverified]
Well, I don't give a fuck if ya'll don't give a fuck

All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
Now I don't give a fuck, if ya'll don't give a fuck
All my niggas is dirty, niggas is dirty
All my niggas is thirsty, thirsty thirsty
All my niggas is star [unverified]
Well, I don't give a fuck if ya'll don't give a fuck
