Peso-Single-:A$AP Rocky
[Verse 1]
I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell my nigga quit the bitching and we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Rolling blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't round my clique for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

[Hook]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause everyday we oughta have pesos
(Gun cock, gun shot, gonna lick a boy)
Cause everyday we oughta have pesos

[Verse 2]
Your bitches said that I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She going really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch double D
Popping E I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga this is what I breath
Inhale, exhale, cocaine X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching wrecks still
So mami show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

[Hook]
