I-Come-Apart:A$AP Rocky
(ASAP Rocky)

I thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave?
Always come back, cause you wanna fuck
Always come back, cause you wanna fuss
Holding back, ain’t no turning back when you fall in love
Know it happens everytime you speak
Always fall flat cause you on the rush
Uh, so you can take it slow
Separate the highs from the low
Separate the evens from the odds
Like something pull me back together when I come apart

(Florence Welch)

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

(ASAP Rocky)

I woke up today, I felt a little less pressure for me
And I mean to say I, may you even learn the lesson for me
If you find the way to fight the pain,
If you fly away, you rest assure

(Florence Welch)

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

(ASAP Rocky)

You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on the left titty

(Florence Welch)

I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the ṗressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
I come apart
