Love:Wayne Wonder
Wake the town
And tell it to the people
Love is what we need
L.O.V.E.

We need more love love love
We need it desperately
We need more love love love
For humanity
We need more love love love
We need it desperately
We need more love love love
L.O.V.E.

Can't you see we're running out the time
And still they're out in light they're blind
Di town they know it's not right
Where is your pride
Can't make life go to a waste
Cause emptiness will take the place
Yes
In these trouble days

We need more love love love
We need it desperately(desperately)
We need more love love love
For humanity(for humanity)
We need more love love love
We need it desperately(desperately)
We need more love love love
L.O.V.E.

From you sincere push up your lighters
We know that we don't have to fight
We are of one blood so let's rise
Don't deny boom
We can't takin over we can't working out
We carry some tings without di guns broke out
I want it to be known
Inna di east a inna di west a inna di north a inna di south

We need more love love love
We need it desperately
We need more love love love
For humanity
We need more love love love
We need it desperately
We need more love love love
L.O.V.E.

Can't you see we're running out the time
And still they're out in light they're blind
Di town they know it's not right
Where is your pride
Can't make life go to a waste
Cause emptiness will take the place
Yes
In these trouble days

We need more love love love
We need it desperately
We need more love love love
For humanity
We need more love love love
We need it desperately
We need more love love love
L.O.V.E.
