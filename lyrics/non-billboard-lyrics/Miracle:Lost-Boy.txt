Lost-Boy:Miracle
Uhh, Vibe with me, look
This is my story, this is my song
Once upon a time I was live for wrong?
In a world where I thought that I didn't belong, I got buzzed to infinity and beyond
Listen, can you hear my vision, living life on a mission, that's why back in school I couldn't afford to pay no attention
Soon to be a legend, the son of a Reprence? see I come up from the bottom so that's my only direction
Pockets on 0 fighting like sub-zero, alienated just like my favorite superhero
Yeah, this is my moment of greatness, been patiently waiting, since my immigration
They say happiness is made, not found, so I'mma go ahead and make mine now
Hope I can make my mother smile, make my brother proud, never let em down ever since I was a child I knew that I was a lost boy

I feel like Jordan before he got drafted, or Mike Jackson before he went platinum
Dedicated to my passion educating the masses praying for answers
Went from sleeping at the airport high on jetfuels to living in a house with my own bedroom
Turn broken pieces into masterpieces, my mother would teach us to have faith in Jesus
I made a promise that rap would never change me
I put a cable on and hope that I can change keys
From this Toyota now I'm feeling like Yoda cause I'll take it by force if they don't wanna play me

Cause I know that this life ain't fair, I'm well aware that the world don't care
Do they see your tears? Why the devil only see your fears? People ask if god hear your prayers but all I know is I'm a lost boy
The sky is not the limit
When you reach it make it your platform
And I pray that platform takes you to the highest of heights
May your dreams become your reality
Triumph over tragedy
And nothing over family, lessons.
