Soldiers-Gone-Psyco:Heltah Skeltah
Straight from the under, I make niggaz wonder
Why, I tap jaws, rock black eyes
See I, know nothing about things I be doing
Lives I ruin, in this here shit we pursuing

My parabellum means swelling, cerebellum when we dwelling
The Caucasoids, you void, my niggaz rebellin'
Who in the hell ever, said you can dwell whether
Or not, I sever your knot, with the shots so whatever I

What, you don't wanna battle me, battle me, that'll be
The day my whole posse rushes your monkey ass like Cato G
True warrior, conquerer, takin' flights, yo
Watch a nugget, I love it when niggaz on sight

Will all true warriors in the house say, "I"
Say, "I", if you not scared to die
You can look a nightmare square in the eye, say, "I"
Soldiers gone psyco, why?

I be your boot camp, veteran, faggots know better than
To test me, see I gets nasty like hedicin'
So who say, not me or Ruck gon' be Saddam
Boy, you moms should of warned you about a walking time bomb
I breaks arms and legs and straight up I bend that ass

So semi in that Henny, and we punk for me to bash 'em
Then ask Ruck, the irrational, here to bash a few
To, after who, you, whose your face to crack the brew
Then laugh at you, what's the, matter, dudes

Walking through my avenue, flappin' about
You wanna battle, dude, have a capitol
That'll do that ass a little justice
Don't fuck with the mothafuckin' Rock and the Ruckness

Will all true warriors in the house say, "I"
Say, "I", if you not scared to die
You can look a nightmare square in the eye, say, "I"
Soldiers gone psycho, why?

So all true warriors in the house say "I"
If you scared to die, then punk, don't reply
The year born copper, I sworn to devour
The injustice crush the ones who are cowards, so act like it can't happen

Act like the Originoo Gunn's don't be Clappin'
When the bitch ruckus reacting
I slap fools, relax with tools in my presence
'Cause that ain't shit, because your murder is the essence

So who wanna come test this champion sound?
Can't go underground, with the lyrics that pound
Profound is the way that I talk, plus
Muthafuckin' stoned is the way of my walk, what

Your jaw's up for grabs, beef, I'm bringin'
Swingin', right to left, side, gets wrecked
You think I'ma ass, money, don't hold ya breath
Let's, take this move, the dungeon to darkness
When guns bark, it's war for real, kid, don't start this

Rockness, Monsta, stomp ya, braids in
Never changing, forever face rearrangin'
Your gamin', the game, kid, you know that shit don't work
So bring ya game here and get ya stupid ass hurt

No under dirt, we won't lay that, don't say jack
I can get ya back sprayed, or ya face smacked
And my black Smif-N-Wessun, that'll show me foldin'
Now who want come and test the champion, boot camp'ion' soldier

Will all true warriors in the house say, "I"
Say, "I", if you not scared to die
You can look a nightmare square in the eye, say, "I"
Soldiers gone psycho, why?

Will all true warriors in the house say, "I"
Say, "I", if you not scared to die
You can look a nightmare square in the eye, say, "I"
Soldiers gone psycho, why?
