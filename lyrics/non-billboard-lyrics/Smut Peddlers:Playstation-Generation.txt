Playstation-Generation:Smut Peddlers
I tell you man I ain't no jiver
I never saw an episode of Survivor
Is there any hope for me
In global corporate society?
Top ten bullshit radio
Tells you to like Slim Shady-o
You're a victim of a media blitz
Sucking on electronic tits
Playstation generation
Target of manipulation
Multinational corporations
Formulate your education
Locked in an internet chat room
Being pumped with gloom and doom
Listening to mad rap rock
Sucking on Rosie O'Donnel's cock
It wouldn't be the end-o
If you smashed up your Nintendo
For once in your life make a sound decision
Kill your fucking television
Playstation generation
Target of manipulation
Multinational corporations
Send your brain on a long vacation
