Huh! I'm the narcotic king, call me sire
Night after night light the club on fire
I'm gettin a lil' tipsy anybody seen Mya?
I'm a have her screamin for her back like Khia
Now we in the penthouse they in the lobby
Gucci frames on I don't see nobody
Damn lil' mama I'm a need yo' body
Up against mine new Armani
I blend with the money, like a good fade (WHAT ELSE!)
I'm a Knick fan we need a good trade (WHAT ELSE!)
Tattoos make your dude feel gnarly
We pop bottles waitress can't call you
Ask about me got it cheaper than Jeezy
Red Cafe money taller than Weezy
Fix all fights shorty I ain't losin

Huh, the Cafe's back, wake the haters
System in the big wheels wake the neighbors
Sellin eight bars, might as well be boostin
That's a +Lil' Flip+, like a rapper from Houston
Ladies you could ride in the Mercedes
And play with Ross Fortune if you born in the 80s'
Uptown niggas say that boy is wavy
But I keep it simple like "fuck you, pay me"
Damn, it feel good to see people up on it
Since I delivered every pie that was ordered (WHAT ELSE!)
Hood favorite, King iz-Arthur
Home with housewives like Tony Piz-arker
Ask Dave Stern I'm a biz-aller
I make the money spin like a revolver
We just gettin warm, the next one is a doozy
Get your popcorn, tonight's the movie

And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
