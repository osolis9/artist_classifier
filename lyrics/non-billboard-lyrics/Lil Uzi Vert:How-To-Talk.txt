How-To-Talk:Lil Uzi Vert
And you didn't come here for me let's talk about it
'Cause if you would have came here for me that would of been planned
You would've put me on
You ain't say oh I'm coming this I'm coming that
You tell me one thing and always do another
'Cause let me know, 'cause you not a man of your word
That's the reason why. So let's talk about it
Oh, you come here for nothing
No, you came here for what?
Whatever you came here for
So, whatever
You have no type of communication at all
So get up out my comments

Talk to me nice, talk to me nice, talk to me nice
You know I'm gon' ball yeah
No way I could fall yeah
They predicted next fall yeah
Look at them like aw yeah
Talk to me, talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
Or dont talk to me at all yeah
On the way one call yeah
Count it up and its all there
Water hittin' look like small tears

Told her talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I say it once, I won't say it twice
Okay might say it twice, because I'm kinda high
Even though I'm so evil, I still look at the sky
And I ask why
Why I treat her like my dog, yeah
We supposed to be all here
She got different color long hair
Pull up coupe two small chairs
Took That girl right in the club
Felt the booty and its all there
So smooth so its all nair
Heard she talk to a ball player (what?) its cool
Heard she talk to a ball player but you know I keep it all player
And I heard he ain't a star player
I'm not worried I'm a heartbreaker
I'm in outer space on Mars faded
I'm not tryna make it R Rated
But my niggas look like Darth Vader

Talk to me nice, talk to me nice, talk to me nice
You know I'm gon' ball yeah
No way I could fall yeah
They predicted next fall yeah
Look at them like aw yeah

Or dont talk to me at all yeah
On the way, one call yeah
Count it up and it's all there
Water hittin' look like small tears

I was in a dream, yeah I used to dream
I was all a dream
Now I'm in reality, don't need those
It's fantasy, what I see, sleep when I'm woke
Real ones can't die, only multiply
I know something it ain't right, how you put me to the side
When I called your phone, you said I was lying
How am I lying? I just pulled up to my show
I'm still on the grind
Heard you got a chauffeur (woo)
Talk to me nice, Talk to me nice
Heard she a doll when she mad, why I flood her all in ice
Ride it like a bike, bust me like a Sprite
Load up the jet for New York tonight

Talk to me nice, talk to me nice, talk to me nice
You know I'm gon' ball yeah
No way I could fall yeah
They predicted next fall yeah
Look at them like aw yeah
Talk to me, talk to me nice

Or dont talk to me at all yeah
On the way, one call yeah
Count it up and it's all there
Water hittin' look like small tears
