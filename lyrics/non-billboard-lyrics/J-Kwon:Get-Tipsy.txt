Get-Tipsy:J-Kwon
Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
2 step with me, 2 step with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
2 step with me, 2 step with me

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Babygirl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour

Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th in the series gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next floor

Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop man we do this for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run

Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hunz
While she goin' down I'm breakin' down what I done
She smokin' my stuff, snashing havin' fun
Geez, give it back now you don't get none

Everybody in the club get tips
Everybody in the club get tipsy
Everybody in the club get tips
Everybody in the club get tipsy

Everybody in the club get tips
Everybody in the club get tipsy
Everybody in the club get tips
Everybody in the club get tipsy

2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in the eye
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy

Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin' with them fries
If so baby, can I get 'em super sized?

Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin' on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's kool
Bit instead of 1 lifestlye I need 2

Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
And she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess why I gotta do

3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Nigga waste it on me man son of a bitch

Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Grisa orange juice man this some goodish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique

Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set Kwon cut out them trees
Dude, I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P
