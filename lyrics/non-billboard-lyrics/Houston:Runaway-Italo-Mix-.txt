Runaway-Italo-Mix-:Houston
Well, I can see that you're running faster
Running from some kind of disaster in your heart
They say you're too young to know the feeling
But still your head is reeling from the pain
Where you gonna run to, where you gonna hide?
Yeah, your momma and daddy don't know you,
While everybody's trying to show you
Why you're wrong
So you're packing your bags and leaving
Thinking some day you'll get even with them all
Then you're out on your own for the first time,
Looking back for the last time, how do you feel?
Where you gonna run to, where you gonna hide?
What'll you do just to keep you alive?

Where you going to my runaway?
Where you gonna run to, where you gonna run and hide
Will you find the answers, runaway?
In the dark of the night
Where there's no one to hold your hand

Out in the streets, all alone and feeling
Just like you're never going home
Then it makes you start remembering,
Who you are and where you've been my friend
Then you watch your sweet-talking Johnny dance
He'll give you the world just to get in your pants
You think he's in love
Where you gonna run to, where you gonna hide?
What'll you do just to keep you alive?

Where you going to my runaway?
Where you gonna run to, where you gonna run and hide
Will you find the answers, runaway?
In the dark of the night
Where there's no one to hold your hand

Where you going to my runaway?
Where you gonna run to, where you run and hide
Will you find the answers, runaway?
In the dark of the night
Where there's no one to hold your hand
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night
