A thirty minute vid, I'm who you're obsessed with
You look like your sister is the girl that you have s*x with
Uh, yeah, do you get the message?
On Twitter threaten rape, we should get this guy arrested
Can you get these sheep out my mentions?
How can I be mad? B*tch, I sleep in a mansion
Try to hold me back but I keep on advancing
When I'm looking at his head, oou, that sh*t so gigantic
I'm coming still, b*tch, my pocket's full of hunnid' bills
I'm in the hills, b*tch, my song just did a hunnid' mil'
They tellin' me to stop flexing but I'm stuntin' still
I ran it up, all of the sudden b*tches wanna chill
Ayy, you done crawled out your little cave
You got a girl but I can tell that you a little gay
Somebody stop the school shooter, he look filled with rage
Speak on my name, little b*tch, I'll put you in the grave
In the Wraith, I see stars like I'm K.O.'d
b*tches chase me, I don't got no time to chase hs
For this song, I was gonna make y'all wait though
But like H3 I had to let the weight go
I remember I was broke, I couldn't dress a lot
Came up from nothing, little b*tch, that's why I flex a lot
How much money did this cost you? Better guess, a lot
Is this nerd ever getting py? sh*t, I'm guessing not
Yeah, he used to get picked on, he a big nerd
He don't got no points, he confuses you with big words
He said he study me for months like a mid-term
Ayy, Content Cop, can you get up off my dick sir?
Yeah, I'm yellow and I'm fly, call me Big Bird
They tryna see me start to fall like September
Try to roast me in the comments but remember
How you gon' support a guy who proudly says the N-word?

I ran it up fast, I feel like The Flash
You can see I'm getting mad, bringing up the past
H3 stop eating snacks, b*tch you getting fat
Flew out PewDiePie just to f*ck him in the a*s
I ran it up fast, I feel like The Flash
You can see I'm getting mad, bringing up the past
H3 stop eating snacks, b*tch you getting fat
Flew out PewDiePie just to f*ck him in the a*s.
