Like-We-Never-Never-Listen-Interlude-:YFN Lucci
I just brought my bitch home a new bitch
Guess that's why I'm so in love, I had to make her my bitch
Lastnight I met a plug, look like we gonna be rich
See we use to have dreams but now we living this shit
I just bought my bitch a Persian Rug, I'ma fuck her on the floor as soon as I hit the door
Like I ain't never made love
But I ain't never made love
But we gone do it like we done this shit before

See she like to explore
I call her little Dora
She keep that pussy on Florida, Florida water
I got on water, water
All these bitches with me came from cross the border
All these bitches with me that's allot of foreigns
Hoppin' out foreigns, this a California
We in California, smokin' California
All these damn ghosts this shit shit paranormal
And my wrist this shit ain't normal
I just bought my bitch home a new bitch and she ain't bitchin' no more
Have fun when I'm on the road
Gotta get the money and go
Gotta get the money and go
I swear this Rose Gold presidential glow
Built a residence for my hoe
Put my hoe in Valentino
I got the recipe and you know
I'm all over the radio
Champagne shower
I fucked that hoe for a hour
We got the money and power
Pull up in Maserati
See we ain't just talkin' about it
We really livin' we ain't just talkin' bout it

I just brought my bitch home a new bitch
Guess that's why I'm so in love, I had to make her my bitch
Lastnight I met a plug, look like we gonna be rich
See we use to have dreams but now we living this shit
I just bought my bitch a Persian Rug, I'ma fuck her on the floor as soon as I hit the door
Like I ain't never made love
But I ain't never made love
But we gone do it like we done this shit before

(Never Listen Interlube)

Steady long, steady wrong
Lately I been goin' home all alone
Lately I been bringin' commas home
Yesterday I smashed a couple hoes
Another day another episode
Y'all better tell them hoes
See you know we get them by the load
I'm talkin' a bail or more
See they wouldn't never know
But we gone get everyone sold
Everyone sold for the whole, nothing low
Everyone out of that boat
Everyone know not to fold
Not to fold, not to fold everyone should know
Pressure bust pipes nigga
The reason ion't like niggas
Fuck her then eat her all night nigga
Then leave her with all my niggas
Even all my niggas know they my niggas
And I'm still screamin' free all my niggas til they free all my niggas
Born to lose swear I hate to lose
Hate the rules so we break the rules
Built to win
Everyday tryin' not to sin
So much smoke need oxygen
Fuckin' up mama pots a pans
This is not pretend
Plus yo bitch load I'm hoppin' in
She told me I'm the fliest nigga she ever saw
That she ever saw, starring at my Audemar
Audemar on Audemar
Just bought my bitch a new Audemar

I had to tell them bitches
I had to tell them bitches
But they didn't never listen
They didn't never listen
But you know we ain't never trippin'
All you gotta do is listen
You got to play yo position
Girl they didn't never listen
