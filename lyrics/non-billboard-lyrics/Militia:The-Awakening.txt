The-Awakening:Militia
through eyes of melted vision 
one sees only twisted images
distorted endlessly an interpretation of reality
on a cold december's eve
black four walls surround cold sweat beads on my brow-deranged i'll wait
and wait i will for the time i know you'll feel my steel
remembering a cold december's eve
i'm no criminal i am the man you fear
the one who lives within your mirror
and when you turn i wont be there
just a shadow to your cold empty stare
on the edge of it all i've lived a lie
and the many times i've wandered
into your world i've died and so i hide inside my own four walls
now time to walk along the path and follow without a sound
as i awaken inside of my cell
a dream again taken a new twisted tale
they kill as i feel and feel as i kill
watching i see i know them too well
my state of confusion drifts into illusion as i fade into the truth
remembering a cold december's eve
