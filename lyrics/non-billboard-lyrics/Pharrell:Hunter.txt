Hunter:Pharrell
[Pre-Chorus:]
Just because it's the middle of night
That don't mean I won't hunt you down
Cause up, in, deep inside
It's pullin' me and I want your love
You and I should be gettin' it right
Ain't no sense in you holdin' on down
If I can't have you, nobody can
This an animal singin' that'll hunt you down

[Chorus:]
So baby, ooh-ooh
My love is kung fu-uuh
And baby, ooh-ooh
My love is kung fu-uuh
Hey baby, ooh-ooh
Sex is kung fu-uuh
Hey baby, ooh-ooh
My love is kung fu-uuh

[Verse 1:]
I show my teeth
And I hope you know that look in my eyes
I got lightnin' speed
I won't hesitate to rescue what is mine

[Bridge:]
Well, hold up baby, what's goin' on?
Tell the truth, I wanna know
What you're doin' when you're gone
Somethin' say you ain't alone
You say, "Baby keep holdin' on"
What you mean? I've been holdin' on
I ain't ever smelled this before
Somethin' say it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Taxidermy is on my walls
With the full description of the killin' calls
I'm a hunter
Cupid, thank you for what you did
But you can't aim and get what I get
I'm a hunter

[Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Duck Dynasty's cool and all
But they got nothin' on a female's call
I'm a hunter
Is that a tree? Is that camouflage?
Come get eaten by the dam mirage
I'm a hunter

[Bridge]

You [?]
[?]
You can't be serious
You know what's in my blood

[Chorus]
