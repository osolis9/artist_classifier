no need to ask why
and u know that I wont desert ya
never hurt ya cuz thats not in my blood
me hurtin u is like a sin
and I got much love
do u really think that I would do u like that
after all we been together
me n your love thats a fact
I know u aint trippin about last night
u dont believe me
im not gonna say anotha word cuz j n mackady

its 2 oclock in the morning
and im tryin to be descret
pickin up the telephone because we have to speak
and even though u made it clear that never in your life
did u wanna have association with a low life
but im sorry what else can I say
u pushed me away and every man needs affection
but hey when u lose the only thing that matters in your life
its hard to breathe hard to think and hard to hold the tears inside
so have compassion give us another try
ill be by your side till I die

lemme take you home everybody gone
me n you alone baby dont worry knock off the phone
makin your body moan makin sure im hittin every spot
makin u hot im hittin the preasure point with all I got
sweatin makin sure that bookie lows not lettin
your fantasy weaken u can call me the human weapon
so baby dont be scared just let me go a little deeper
let me explore that hot love and makin u much weaker
if u wanna do whateva u want then baby im your man
got the latte n the kids so keep it if u can
cuz this is all night
1 or 2 minutes of passion
hours n hours of hot lovin to have u passin out
makin u scream n shout takin another route
believe im gonna give u the definition of what loves about

mama used to tell me theyre be gurls like this
being a playa neva thought I would feel like this
cuz aint nothin like the feelin that you give when the lights is dim
satin bed material all I wanna get in like a rush takin over
maybe this can be addicting and I can be your puppetier
for the fantasy u kinky some of sexaholic
got my fiendin 4 the flesh
now it really dosnt matter all the chatter going round
when it comes to satisfaction cant be wastin time with clowns
cause its all about the choices
sexy voices on the lobes of the ears of the hunnies so real
so tell me how u feel

and baby u know that were gonna keep it on the real
so what u wanna do now
we know abotu each others past
seein each other butt naked and even t0ok a bath with each other
u say I love u down like no other
made it clear as a picture when we was sweatin up under the covers
now look me n my eye and remember
that the only one that gave u all the lovin that u needed was this guy
so when u need that passion that your body lackin
make sure u call on bookie low the one thats packin
