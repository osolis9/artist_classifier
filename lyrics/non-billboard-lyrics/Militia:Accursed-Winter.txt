Accursed-Winter:Militia
i sit alone and watch the rising sun
and the waiting seems to be so long
i see her face in my dreams in a bed of agony she waits to see the mystery of pain
look beyond your world of make believe
for now what's left behind the tears
the battered flesh a world of fear
so look beyond your world of make believe
cos' there's a life filled with pain and misery
another accursed winter
they said i'd find you waiting here
bearing scars from winter
staring endlessly remembering
