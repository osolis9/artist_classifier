The name is Krayzie "Big Bad Ass" Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, along
With some cash, even took the mayor's daughter

Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it so I brought her
Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble, double-crossed by the law
So there's nobody to run to, yeah, it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
Outlaw--call him Leather Face

I'm headed for the West, heard they got
A couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown

So, I continue my mission it's gettin' dark
So I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns
They like to catch ya, then they rob and split
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips

All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse"Whoa, Nellie! Who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out"
Who is this? I hope this ain't the law
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun

"C'mon out, right now, I'm gettin' angry"
Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous
Thug Queen, "the horse stealer"
"Please don't shoot it's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer"

"Then, why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes?"
"I'm wanted in four counties for armed robbery
Killed to two sheriffs, six of his best men with my hand, stole two horses
Thought you was the law, that's why I jumped in the bushes"
"Goodness", now, she was hotter than the barrel on fire
But I could use her for the job, so I told her to ride, "C'mon"

"May I ask you what you headed to the West for?"
"I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you're down, you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
â€½Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you're with it"

"We out before the sun rise, gotta stallion for your partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine, down for whatever, let's ride, let's rideâ€
"These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive, we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the mornin' for details and hook-up"

"Rise and shine! Good mornin', howdy
Nine o'clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now, I done came a long way, and I don't wanna be late"
"Tell him I make ya [Unverified] 'cause you know we ain't"
"Move out! Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup"

I'm peepin' Krayzie's wanted poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble around here pretty soon
Glance across the room, I see this youngster getting ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life

So, I approach him, and I pause "Look, man, I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws come messin' up this master plan?"
Since he already rowdy, I just asked the man, "Hey, you want some work?
Well, partner, put in your bid, and by the way, now what's your name?â€
â€½They call me Layzie the Kid"

"The name's Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw, everyday on the front page Mister Kid
If you give me the lowdown, me and Black Jack
Be ready for the showdown with two double-barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together I'm purty clever"
"So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon, because it's all goin' down"
I heard a guy run in the bar screamin', "Krayzie's in town"

"Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside, and don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses"
Step inside the bar, "Lay the Kid, you son of a gun"
"Hey, man, I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun"

"Howdy"
"Mighty glad to meet ya, son, oh yeah
You know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen, the horse peddler, straggler, just met her"
"Howdy, partner, already got the horses saddled up"
"I hope you good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up"

"Now, y'all, it's gon' be gettin' dark real soon"
"I think you're right, I say we move, c'mon, let's move out
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup, move out"
