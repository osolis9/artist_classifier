It's just one of those days when ya don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why
But you wanna justify rippin' someone's head off

No human contact
And if you interact your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, talkin' that shit

It's just one of those days, feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain, leaves with a blood stain
Damn right I'm a maniac, you better watch your back
'Cuz I'm fuckin' up your program

And if you're stuck up, you just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, talkin' that shit
Punk, so come and get it

I feel like shit, my suggestion is to keep your distance
'Cuz right now I'm dangerous, right now I'm dangerous
Right now I'm dangerous, right now I'm dangerous
Right now I'm dangerous

And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break your fuckin' face tonight
Give me somethin' to break, give me somethin' to break

I hope ya know, I pack a chainsaw
A chainsaw, a motherfuckin' chainsaw
So come and get it, right now I'm dangerous
Right now I'm dangerous, right now I'm dangerous
Right now I'm dangerous

It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, talkin' that shit
So come and get it
