Dream-On-Me:Belly
Hey bitchery, you stole enough from me
I gotta go, I gotta go home now
In this misery, you've had enough of me
I gotta go, I gotta go home now

Where there's easy love and there's easy life
Dream on me when you sleep
Keep your head where you said it would be
Dream on me when you sleep
Keep your head like you said

Hey bitchery, you stole enough from me
I gotta go, I gotta go home now
In this misery, I've had enough of me
I gotta go, I gotta go home now

Where there's easy love and there's easy life
Dream on me when you sleep
Keep your head where you said it would be
Dream on me when you sleep
Keep your head like you said
And you said, like you said, like you said

Dream on me
Dream on me
Dream on me
