Diamonds:Slim Thug
Diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel

I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
That's right, diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel

Now who other than Slim Thugga still tippin' on fo's
Wrapped up in 'gator bo's closin' them candy do's
Drank poe, music slow, how I roll when I'm flossin'
Trunk cracked in the back, I'm in my lack big bossin'

I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a playa' shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
I'm tryin' to chill 'cause pussy niggaz ain't real
Gon' make me drop 'em with the hands or pop 'em with the steel

I'm the Dirty South boss, them other suckas is clones
Misrepresentin' Texas with them weak ass songs
My screens showin', trunk glowin' while I flip through the hood
Big diamonds, shinin', blindin' while I'm grippin' my wood

I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel

I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
That's right, diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel

I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
Butter top droppin' on the candy Coupe de Ville
Cup full of drank, man, we poppin' pint seals
The candy trunk bangin' while I drop the fifth wheel

Ridin' so low, I got my hand up on the steel
Them jackers tryna plot, I bet the glock'll make 'em chill
I'm straight up outta Texas, yeah, the land of the trill
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel

Had to bring back the foe's, made them put away the choppers
Got the candy blue shinin' while I'm swangin' on the boppers
Keep straight through stop signs, fuck if the law stop us
Screamin', â€½Free Pimp Câ€ to the motherfuckin' coppers

I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel

That's right, diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shinin', bitch, tell me how you feel
