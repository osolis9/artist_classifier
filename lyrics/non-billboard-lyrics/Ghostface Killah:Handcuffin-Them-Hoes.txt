Handcuffin-Them-Hoes:Ghostface Killah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I cheat and I fuck other bitches
Y'all just lame sucker for love ass niggaz
Su.F.L.A.N, go ahead and spell it out
I gets my love game on without a doubt

My girl know I'm live, point blank period
Handcuffin' them hoes, y'all can't be serious
You ain't cut from the right cloth, fuck your rag
One word in your bitch ear, she all in the bag

Give a fuck if that's your broad, she shouldn't be out
We in the club lookin' to put somethin' fat in her mouth
Easy, hold on, I see a fox comin'
Between now and a few hours I'll be up in her stomach

And I ain't even gotta be dipped
I pull out my pocket too Sloppy Joe, mixed this thick
You ever try foldin' a brick?
Tryin' to shove hundred dollar bills in your jeans and half of it rip?

We them Staten Island boys, intelligent thugs
9 out of 10 times, yeah, we lookin to fuck
And y'all already word know what it is
On some Teena Marie shit, nucca, I'm talkin' square biz
What?

Y'all need to stop, handcuffin' them hoes
  (Stop cuffin' these hoes)
Comin' in the club, handcuffin' them hoes
  (Westhaven)
You don't even know 'em, handcuffin' them hoes
  (Sucker)
Cuffin' them hoes, cuffin' them hoes
  (I hear you Ghost, Jones)

F-E-M-L, Fuck 'em and we leave 'em
P-I-M-P, treat 'em like we great 'em
Shit, treat 'em like we don't need 'em
'Cause after we fuck 'em, out the phone, we delete 'em

Leave 'em for them suckers, let them other niggaz keep 'em
They keep 'em to the point that we don't see 'em
Shit, but the bitches need freedom
They wanna come outside and start freakin'

Jumpin' on dick like they leapin', it's leap year
She disappearin' for the weekend
So hell yeah she starts creepin'
You had her locked up like she was livin' in precinct

She want a gangster, nigga yous a weakling
She wanna ride fast in the cars while we chiefin'
Just cause you was cuffin' the hoe
I had fucked her one time now I'm duckin' this hoe

Please in your mind, never drop a dime but
Damn, ain't that some shit?
And I just wanted to have a good time
Now I got a hoe on my line, buggin', slow down

Y'all need to stop, handcuffin' them hoes
Comin' in the club, handcuffin' them hoes
You don't even know 'em, handcuffin' them hoes
  (Stop cuffin' these hoes)
Cuffin' them hoes, cuffin' them hoes
  (Stop cuffin' these hoes)

Y'all need to stop, handcuffin' them hoes
  (Stop cuffin' these hoes)
Comin' in the club, handcuffin' them hoes
You don't even know 'em, handcuffin' them hoes
  (Stop cuffin' these hoes)
Cuffin' them hoes, cuffin' them hoes
  (Stop cuffin' these hoes)
