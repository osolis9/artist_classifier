Do-Or-Die:Do Or Die
Do or dieLike our livesNo trunin' backIt's our prideA second family, takin' care of each othersWe are more than friends, we call them brotherAs a circle of friends, no beginning no endWe can't leave our common past behind usAll these years, we've invested in the same wayIn a total devotion in what we stand forDays after days, years after yearsReeping intact our rage to overcomDo or dieLike our livesNo turnin' backI'ts our prideDo or die
