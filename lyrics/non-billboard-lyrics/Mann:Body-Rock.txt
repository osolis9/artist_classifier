Body-Rock:Mann
[**feat. Audio Push**]



[Intro:]
 Now baby hop up in your way
 Push that automatic stop car park
 Get that tell the dj turn this up
 Go and let it bang see this for ma ladies
 Where they ladies I know they're hitin to the club

 Uh I'm so in the house swagger so similar
 Blow fly hot hot temperature skin color
 Mocha body like a bottle coca cola
 No joke a need her on my side
 So I say aloha hey let me know your name
 Do you need a man I'm in the club
 Watch you do your thing
 You think I' m a fan so join my team
 Or I'll go insane cause every
 Superman needs a Luis Lane

[Chorus:]
 Go and wave your hand girl now wave your
 Hands girls now lay your hands girl
 If your love it do your dance girl
 Cause it's that body body rock
 Do your dance girl cause it's your body body rock

 I see you and your girls pull up in the 7
 And quick question
 Did it hurt when you dropped down from heaven
 Baby cause you're a blessing and your body's fire
 Got that boy feelin so obsessed no Mariah
 Don't give him lies what they say
 They was no classroom but I'm gonna give you
 Great A love I see you poppin in your jeans
 You rockin it insane so move your favorite girl
 And don't complain

[Chorus:]
 Go and wave your hand girl now wave your
 Hands girls now lay your hands girl
 If your love it do your dance girl
 Cause it's that body body rock
 Do your dance girl cause it's your body body rock

 I'm feelin your vibe can I get witched or what
 Feelin your thighs and I picture me lifting
 Them up feelin your eyes mesmerizing
 When I'm lookin into them what do I have to do
 Do the phiscally get you come with me
 The man in my city the one you lose hate on
 And the one in my city to take from L.A. to Panama City
 I'm gonna need you to be...

[Chorus:]
 Go and wave your hand girl now wave your
 Hands girls now lay your hands girl
 If your love it do your dance girl
 Cause it's that body body rock
 Do your dance girl cause it's your body body rock
