Hi-Lo-Hollow-:Bishop Briggs
Killing me slowly, holding me close
Begging for mercy, forgiving the ghost
Say that you love me, lay me to waist
We've build a fire and you put out the flames

You're so hi-lo, hi-lo
Hi-lo, hi-lo
You're so hi-lo, hi-lo
Hollow, hollow

And I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow, oh

I'm so hollow, hollow, oh
I'm so hollow, hollow, oh

The safety is broken, intentions are numb
Whispers and daggers, we're losing our tongue
Tracing the stitches, searching for grace
Say that you love me but you faded to gray

You're so hi-lo, hi-lo
Hi-lo, hi-lo
You're so hi-lo, hi-lo
Hollow, hollow

And I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow, oh

I'm so hollow, hollow, oh
I'm so hollow, hollow

Foster my heart, foster my pain
Bring me to life, kill me for game
Oh I, idle is the devil's hand when you're waiting for change
Strike me down, lift me up, my love remains

But you're so hi-lo, hi-lo
Hi-lo, hi-lo
You're so hi-lo, hi-lo
Hollow, hollow

And I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow

I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow
I'm so hollow, hollow
Hollow, hollow, oh
Hollow, hollow, oh
Hollow, hollow, oh
