Fuck-Um-All:Chris Brown
[** feat. Kevin McCall, Diesel:]


You know, this shit is really a hard work, you know?*
Shit, who am I kidding, man?
Go easy!
I'm in my zone man!
Fuck them all like an orgy,
Don't remember their name if ain't important,
Fuck um!
Fuck um!
You know it sucks to be hated!
But it feels great to be loved!

Fuck them all like an orgy,
Don't remember their name if ain't important,
Haters better stay in L.A. I'm...
Niggers I've been flat, you're all just boring.
Fuck them all like an orgy,
Don't remember their name if ain't important!
Yeah, how much...
Fucking over niggers like a lady in a...
And I'm on the top now,..
Hope you brought your optimism
Cause my ship is fucked
How the fuck I end up here?
Better yet,
How the fuck I do it in the... make them feel good?
Music like a fuck into the ears, palls.
No homo, no... that is weird,
Now tell me who the fuck...
If it's not love, cause Judgment Day is near,
I wish I knew then,
What I know now,
Cause nobody can judge me,
Not even...

[Chorus:]
... fuck them all
All these niggers ain't no me,
Cause I'm the man of the hour,
Yeah!

Fuck them out like a...
Can't say shit cause you know what...
Do it like Gwen Stefani, give them no doubt,
Call me commando, I'm going... out, palls,
So the defense is gonna blow,
Never take a break so I'm always on...
My duty is to do best, what I'm doing I've been killing,
The sickest so, I shit on everybody, I've been...
Now nigger, I'm cold, but that don't mean I'm chilling,
I got some bad,.. and they're already willing,

Shit,..
Like a tiger in the freezer I'm a cool cat,
I'm the reason why V.I.P on this club cracked.
I know you... at, so bring more bottles,
And don't worry about the tip,
I've got them!

[Chorus]

Fuck them all, haters talk a lot,
Voices in my head tell me...

I swear I... like monopoly,
And this whole tale... to your property,
Nothing in my wallet,.. a shit on the lottery,
Ain't talking... when I say to a girl follow me.
Give me your patrol...
Got me... and so smooth,
I'm gonna call it and drink Vermont.
I'm all right now, the ladies are with me,
Acting like they love me, so I'm getting this house an image.
Fuck them all cause I know they all will let me

[Chorus]
