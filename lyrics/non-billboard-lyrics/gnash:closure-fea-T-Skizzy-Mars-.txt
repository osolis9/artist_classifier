Closure
I just wanna give you closure
So maybe I can find some closure
To start over
So now I'm reaching out for closure
I just wanted to come over
And tell you everything I've never told ya
But now it's over

Open ended conversations
Unfulfilled obligations
You say rapping
Ain't an occupation
But God bless you for being patient
I know it's been up and down
I know you've been lost and found
I can see you in that wedding gown
They don't love me
They just love my sound
But I know you the real deal
So I gotta keep it real real
You sex appeal real ill
Used to smoke joints and watch kill bill
And I know, how cliche
I know my words don't mean much
But their all I got
Gotta give it a shot
Closure

Closure
I just wanna give you closure
So maybe I can find some closure
To start over
So now I'm reaching out for closure
I just wanted to come over
And tell you everything I've never told ya
But now it's over

They say breaking up is hard to do
But waking up is harder boo
And moving on is hardest ooh
But this feeling here is nothing new
I'll always have a thing for ya
Even tho I'm not the thing for ya
You know lowkey I miss what we had
Ok, highkey cause I miss you bad
I lost myself while I was tryna find you
I learned to love myself, I'm feeling brand new
And don't you think I don't got nothing to do
But life kinda sucks lonely here without you
Because all I got is me, weed and this music
All you got left is you, him, and me clueless
So I won't waste your time
And I wish you well
But sometimes this still hurts like hell

Closure
I just wanna give you closure
So maybe I can find some closure
To start over
So now I'm reaching out for closure
I just wanted to come over
And tell you everything I've never told ya
But now it's over
