Part 1: Oh My

[Chorus]
Yeah
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time
Oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
(Yeah)
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time
Oh my
Oh my, oh my

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott + Quavo]
I've been up for a long time
Broad day
I've been popping pills
Pouring syrup, everyday
Cuzo hanging at my aunty house (bando!) selling ye
I got shooters dressed in camo (Grrrra!)
Oh my
I've been in and out the courthouse, drug tripping
I've been flipping, flipping syrup, sipping, (flipping!) water whipping (whipping!)
Mama kicked me out the house now, oh my
I might end up on the couch now, oh my
I'm on a flight now (yeah!), oh my
LA at another couch now, oh my
I'm counting up nothing but Benjamin's right now (money!)
Oh my
I'm on a flight now, we so high
About to get some cash now (cash!), oh my
Got my momma that new house now (momma!), oh my
Now she cannot kick me out now (no!), oh my
I've been up for a long time (La Flame!), oh my

[Chorus]
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time
Oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Part 2: Dis Side

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Wow
Let me tell you a little story about this side
You really can't make it on this side
Lot of lone stars on this side
I feel a lot at home on this side
Ball until we fall on this side
Lit late night on this side
You never come around past midnight
You miss everything on this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side
I made a lot of money on this side
Lost a lot of money on this side
Had my first kiss on this side
Learned a lot of shit about this side
Clearly I've been thinking about this side
Tryna get back on this side
Tryna get back what's been mine
I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feeling of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner had shit tight
Doin' all the drugs had to get right
If I could get my partner back it would be nice
He would shoot the one, wouldnâ€™t think twice
He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side
This side, this side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Young rich nigga from the north side
Paid my dues on this side
Flipping up bricks on this side
I made it out the hood I'm on the other side
All my niggas on this side
Keep it one hundred on this side
Love to get money on this side
No new niggas on this side
Look at my diamonds don't get blind
You better handcuff you ho with a zip tie (cuff!)
I will take a busta down on this side
Broke niggas stand to the left side
Handsome and Wealthy on this side
I came from the bottom and now I'm on top thats phenomenal
This side, this side, this side, this side
If I do not make it I wonder where I will go
This side, this side, this side
Graduated from the midget
This the life I was living
Graduated to a million
It's the money that I'm getting
Graduated from a hotbox now I ride around in a Bentley
How we do it on

[Outro: Travi$ Scott]
This side, this side, this side
Always, always this side
This side, this side, this side
Thats right, thats right
You ever come around thats midnight
Midnight, midnight
You know how I like my lean, po' up
Just right
On this side
Find everything you need, everything you need on this side
This side, this side, this side
Is right
