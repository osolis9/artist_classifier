They-Don-t-Know-Radio-Edit-:Savage
The neighborhood dudes think I'm no go
But, they don't know
Girls at school think you is a fool
But, they don't know
I could be yours, but -
They'll never know
They can think whatever they like
But I want you to know

You gotta tell me straight - are the rumors true?
Did you really do them things that you use to?
'Cause the girls at school say that I'm a fool
And they don't understand what I see in you
When I, don't know why they're bugging me
And they, always start tripping when you're hugging me
But I, really think you're lovely
And I guess they can't get enough of me
And I'm sick of she say, he say shit
What you done, where you been and who you with
These girls ain't my friends, they just like to shine
All of a sudden they jealous 'cause I made you mine

The neighborhood dudes think I'm no go
But, they don't know
Girls at school think you is a fool
But, they don't know
I could be yours, but -
They'll never know
They can think whatever they like
But I want you to know

Now here goes Charlie talking shit
Telling all the boys you was all his chick
Now I don't wanna resort to this
If I have to Charlie will be falling quick
And I don't understand why they all keep bugging
I walk in the room nobody ain't say nothing
They always calling when they see you out clubbing
(Savage I think your girl was getting up to something)
Huh, yo that can't be true, now you wouldn't be lying
To my face now would you
Besides she was out with my sister
And they both told me you was tryna kick it with her
Friends how many of us have them
Right before the time when they start back stabbing, huh
Never mind they all of that
Now can you please, can you please give it up for Savage

They don't know, no-no, no they don't even know
We got this good thing goin' on
From the streets to the room
From the streets to the room
My steez for you and that's
What I want you to know The neighborhood dudes think I'm no go
