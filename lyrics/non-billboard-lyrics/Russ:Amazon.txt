Amazon:Russ
Yeah, everybody needs to get away.
No stress livin' wake up with no cameras on.
Livin' in the amazon.
No-one that can be wrong.
Feelin' so blessed.
Walkin' through this wonderland.
Giving up to Alas just enough for her to understand no sex.
Then it's back to traveling all around utopia.
Where nobody have a friend.
Yes I am imagining, I prefer it this way.
Lost enough to love in my reality it was misplaced, no mistake I escaped. all the way to ____ which is our palace. That's it
