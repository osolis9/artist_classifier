Empty-Spaces:Eminem, 50 Cent & Busta Rhymes
Alright, let's go

[Hook x2: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
They say I walk around like got an S on my chest
Naw, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt a duck a nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You getting money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it, the Mac I blast it
D's come we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your momma picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes. Got em cooking, boy
This crooked mind of mines got em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fucking clock, I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'mma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words so your fucking heads better nod
Or I'mma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk; you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast
Your fuckin' head'll spin, dogg
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives

[Hook]
