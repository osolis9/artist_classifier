Be-Thankful-for-What-You-ve-Got:Massive Attack
Though you may not drive a big big Cadillac
Gangster whitewalls, TV antenna in the back

You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got

Though you may not drive a big big Cadillac
(Diamonds in the back, sunroof top diggin' the scene with the gangster lean)
Gangster whitewalls, TV antenna in the back

You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got

Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin' the scene
With the gangster lean, oh oh oh

Though you may not drive a big big cadillac
Gangster whitewalls, TV antenna in the back

You may not have a car at all
But just remember brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful for what you've got

Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin' the scene
With the gangster lean, oh, oh, oh
Diamonds in the back
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin' the scene
With the gangster lean, oh, oh, oh

Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin' the scene
With the gangster lean, oh, oh, oh
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin' the scene
With the gangster lean, oh, oh, oh
