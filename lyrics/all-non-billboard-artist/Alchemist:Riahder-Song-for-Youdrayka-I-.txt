Riahder-Song-for-Youdrayka-I-:Alchemist
As sky is green, as grass is blue 
As night is white, as day is black 
As shadow is bright, as sun is dark 
As just our words are without sense 
As storm is calm, as sea is still 
As stars are close, as soul is dead 
As ice is hot, as fire is cold 
As just our love lacks any feelings 

I don´t wanna see you cry 
Your tears are arrows through my heart 
Why you force me to lie to you 
And believe that everything´s all right 

Your hair is red, your eyes are damp 
Your face is nice, your blood in veins 
Your heart in fire, your mind in ice 
Just like our touches without flame 
As storm is calm, as sea is still 
As stars are close, as soul is dead 
As ice is shot, as fire is cold 
As just our love lacks any feelings 

I don´t wanna see you cry 
Your tears are arrows through my heart 
Why you force me to lie to you 
And believe that everything´s all right
