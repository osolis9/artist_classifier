Mic check, now in effect
Suckers still comin short
That's why I'm callin order in the court
It looks like a lotta suckers gotta learn the hard way
It doesn't pay when you tamper with my deejay
Back and forth, up and down on the (cut)
Aladdin's in the house, so yo, move your butt and strut
Turn up what I call Aladdin's On A Rampage
Dim the lights, roll the carpet on the stage

Straight from the W, boy, step back
Because I (got the master of a disco scratch)
Aladdin, he's on a rampage for days
The last sucker played brave, winded up gettin slayed
Dissed to the rhythm, like somethin hit him
He's like venom, that's why you suckers can't get with him
My man pointure punks like dried-out snails
Yo yo, Aladdin how hard are you? (Hard as hell)
Homebody, now how you feel about punks on your jock?
(The way I feel now I just got to rock)
(Aladdin rocks the house) it ain't a mystery
That everything (has got to be funky)
Yeah, up and down and all around the crossfader
Hands start to bleed as if the table was a grader
Without hesitation, here's a tastin demonstration
How we got a standin ovation
Straight from Low Pro, he's ready to attack
Yo yo, Aladdin, hit em with a (funky scratch)

He's on a rampage, brace yourself and get stable
For the (king of the cuts on two turntables)
(Suckers) how can you hang upon stage
When your deejay cuts like he's out the yellow page
When he scratch on a record, when the crowd to applaud
With a posse on your cover, so you can look hard
Punks, you're lookin pitiful, Aladdin is original
East Coast, West Coast, Compton, South Central
It doesn't matter, Aladdin's on the cut
And the Doub is on his side to make you move your butt
Aladdin, show em somethin new for those who don't know ya

Yo, he's a top-rank chief (on the wheels of steel)
Seems everywhere we go, Aladdin's rippin it up

To show these party people what happens when you (rock the bells)
