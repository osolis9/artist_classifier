Inspiration:Sean McGee
If I was a stone you'd be my rock
If I fell out of love you'd catch my fall
And if I'm just a little baby you're my all
Like a brother and his keeper you're the key to my heart
If I need a ride girl you're my car
No matter the destination baby near or far
You take me there with no complaints
That's why you're mine with no restraints.
There wont be a moment that I ever wanna give you up
Cause I ain't trying to build a brand new trust with anyone, no not with anyone
We've got something greater than I've ever known
And I don't wanna let this go for anything
No one will ever do me better
Its you I'm to be counting on
Too long I been searching for what's been right here in front of my face
You're my inspiration, to be all I can be
To do all that I do, you're everything to me
Here's your standing ovation, you deserve a round of applause
For everything you are

If I need a drink, you'd quench my thirst
If I was in pain you'd heal my hurt
And if I need a little you'd just give me your all
Like a mother and a child I need you to stay strong
If I ain't have a job you'd do the work
No matter how hard it is because you feel I'm worth it
Treat me like a king and that why you my purpose

And if I'm ever alone, I know that I can depend on you to be
Here in a hurry when I call You're my inspiration, to be all I can be
To do all that I do, you're everything to me
Here's your standing ovation, you deserve a round of applause
For everything you are
