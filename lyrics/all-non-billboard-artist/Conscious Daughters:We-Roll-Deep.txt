We-Roll-Deep:Conscious Daughters
(Verse 1: CMG)
Ten-thirty five on a Saturday night
From our lands rollin deep hittin switches and shit is alright
Yeah, my homey's just deep, cat (The special one)
We do it in a summer in Oaktown
It's simply fun
Check the episode and the flow
As I run it down to yah
Ask you How it sound tah yah?
See I grew a little in 92
And now it's 93 and see it's doper than most
Getting paid while them other hoes fade
Cause they can't come close
I'm on some new, improved, gotta-get-my-type shit
When the rhyme hit
You nots tah fuck with
The see B40 MG never friendly
cause I never see the value in you getting close to me
And that's real G
So check out the realism in words written
The kitten you never hittin still shockin shit
And givin y'all a lil mo of that funky good ghetto sound
So don't sleep when I creep
Shit, I'm rollin deep

(Chorus)
We rollin deeper
Yah we rollin deeper
You know we rollin deeper than most (nigga)
We rollin deeper
So bump in your speakers
And let the daughters freak you the most (Yah)
We rollin deeper
The 40's in the freezer
We fuckin with the reefah the most (Hit that)
We rollin deeper so bump it in your jeeper because we rollin deeper than most

(Verse 2: Special One)
Now it's time for the special one to do work
Cause niggas say I'm doin work
Or better yet they say that I'm doin dirt
With federal shit
I'm a factor from Oaktown
But check the episode
Cause I be rollin when I throw down
Oh now
I see so many rappers is runnin up
And many devils want to get a taste of that scarface cut
But they ain't fuckin with the women on the rise
Because we got cha
But know who's hot and who's not
We getting straight props
Back it up
I'm comin through the knuckle dirty slap happy bitch
Killin playa from the O
Is letting niggaz know
See CD in full effect is not to be fuck with
Never no
Not even a little cause the style is dope
So it's time you see comin into yah town
A simple What up, K peace out and a shake or a pound
And then raise up
Cause groupies they imitate
Here today but what can I say
I'm on the creep

(Chorus)
We rollin deeper
Yah we rollin deeper
You know we rollin deeper than most (ha ha& yeah)
We rollin deeper
So bump in your speakers
And let the daughters freak you the most
We rollin deeper

(Verse 3: CMG & Special One)
Don't you get too close ho
But get a taste of the mack flow
The shit kickin, pistol whippin, young ass mic pro
CMG is funky when she grip on the mic
See& killin off them hookers, and heavies and hoes softly
Funky lil child reign born supreme
Like a queen
Devout us backhanded bitch
To hit the rap scene
Takin niggas like that
Cause I do work too
And I'm doing dirt
So be alert when I comin through
Still mackin and pimpin and fuckin around
Servin up shit when we hit with the conscious sound
So know you what's the time when we hit the set
Servin all you suckers so you never forget

We fuckin with the reefah the most (Pass the blunt)
We rollin deeper so bump it in your jeeper because we rollin deeper than most
