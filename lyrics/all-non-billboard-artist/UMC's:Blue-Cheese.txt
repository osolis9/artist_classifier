Blue-Cheese:UMC's
I can definitely hold (hold) a title
Drink a beer and fold, the suckas are legit
Who told (told) the public that we weren't bold
(Now that's a definite disgrace)
Disgrace (yeah)
So I have to give the public what they want
(Fear) is just a total disruption of my stunt
(You're being very blunt)
Now I'll unto a method that's new to start a hunt (How?)
Well, I kick it like so you see, I'm a UMC
Giving giving blows three forces of nature
Earth, wind, fire, let's negate the
Good cause I'm bad with the skill to create the
Quite slick, various tricks of the know how
Of a master like Col. Powell

Kick up, now that's just a common expression when I pick up
And start to teach my first lesson
(Arithmetic, reading, and writing) Not too exciting
I'll pick up on teachings that orchestrate my kingdom
Based upon elements of lyrics I bring them
Stone by stone (but did you build it alone?)
No kid was prone to seek it alone
From the kid who did, sell a party well
(Do tell) Oh well, I done told on
(Wait up hold on) Nah, watch him flow on
So on, so on, watch me grow on
I keep growing til I start to sneeze
(What's Mark salad's G's?) Blue cheese

Blue cheese is the topic at hand
Cheesy blue (true) elements can't stand
When I elaborate on the fake calobrate
Non potent forces of a food for a rodent
(Jokes?) Nope, just comes later
The procreator, I'm the one that saved the
Year of 1991, made it obvious for the entire world to find the fun
Or better yet we (kind of clever) get
The level said "check" all hands on deck
For the source of my skill is all real
Fashioned to eliminate the weak who are marked with the seal
Of blue cheese

Now back to the nest at the foot of the tree
One for the hype MC, the cool in me
The Kim, the cooling, I'm a slave for no man
Stand like low pants, slam like Rodan
Who can? (You can?) Damn, I'm grand dad
Step off the runway, I'm preparing for landing
Three-point drop turn stop and freeze
Spin 360 degrees for blue cheese
