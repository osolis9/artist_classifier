Strugglin-:C-Mob
Verse 1:
This life ain’t fuckin’ fair
I’m lookin’ down in my pockets and there ain’t nothin’ there
I wish they wasn’t bare
Nobody fuckin’ cares
Whether I live or whether I die
But I refuse to give up so I gotta do what I gotta do just to survive, I
I’m back on the street, gotta get on my feet just to eat now
Whoever will take to prevent me from makin’ it takin’ a beatdown
I’m tryin’ to get major pay
Lettin’ my problems fade away
But it seems like everything gets worse 
There’s more drama from day to day
Can’t it go back to a life that’s so simple
I’m fuckin’ fed up with these hard times
Motherfucker’s wanna bust like a pimple
I’m steadily havin’ to guard mine
Mentality every starred mine
Tellin’ me when will we have our time
Don’t nobody ever wanna see us shine
They don’t give a fuck about our kind
They say that they do but we know the difference of what they say and ment
Politicians they hide behind the lies that they invent
When will I benefit from the money they claim that they done spent
But I don’t have time to think about all that shit I’m tryin’ to pay the rent

Chorus:
I’m steady strugglin’
Do what I can to keep my empty pockets bubblin’
I gotta eat so now I’m back on the corner hustlin’
Tryin’ to make it in this wicked world my life is troublin’
I’m steady strugglin’
X2

Verse 2:
I cannot continue to live like this gotta make it come up from nothin’
If I wasn’t then I have to go get out I cannot just sit around fussin’
I gotta go get my boots laced
Stay away from the two faced
I’m tryin’ to go from keepin’ money in pockets to carryin’ it in a suitcase
That is my mission
But I have a vision
If I go to cookin’ cocaine in the kitchen
Then all of a sudden I’m outta commission
And up in the prison cuz somebody snitches
Nobody to analyze every decision
And handle my business wit proper precision
Continue to learn and when I look and I listen
So I don’t end up in that kinda condition
Reality’s beatin’ me into submission
I cannot just sit around hopin’ and wishin’
And be reminissin’ on everything missin’
Or I might not even have a pot to piss in
I gotta stay positive no type of bitchin’
I gotta go get what I want if it’s givin’
And all of this drama is keepin’ me drivin’
Right now I’m survivin’ I’m tryin to be livin’
And it seems lately no matter how hard I try
My problems continue to triple and double my troubles they multiply
I gotta get outta this hell that I’m livin’ in so it’s do or die
Wanna peak at the pain that’s lingerin’ in my sole look into my eyes
But I will rise, gotta make it come up stay organized with my guys
Whoever thinkin’ that they clever when when hit in gender I’ll sever the ties
See thru the lies, overcome all of despise 
And focus on the prize
Lookin’ up at the lord feel my senserity please listen to my cries

Chorus:
I’m steady strugglin’
Do what I can to keep my empty pockets bubblin’
I gotta eat so now I’m back on the corner hustlin’
Tryin’ to make it in this wicked world my life is troublin’
I’m steady strugglin’

Verse 3:
I gotta get out and go handle my business I’m sick of bein’ stuck
I’m livin’ in a world that’s a great big pussy waitin’ to get fucked
There’s a million to one opportunities surely I’m sure to be makin’ a buck
All I gotta do in my life is roll the dice and try to press my luck
Like Yuk, wanna have a Regime
Fresh crease in my Dickies cuz I gotta stay clean
Makin’ sure my senses stay kean
I wanna stay nice but I gotta stay mean
Cuz these politicians don’t give a shit
People in the church is hipocrits 
I’m tired of workin’ my motherfuckin’ ass off just to make a little bit
I’m needin’ mo mail
Tryin’ to be free wit no jail
Motherfuckers don’t wanna help me out but I’m like fuck it oh well
I don’t need nobody to watch my back I grind all by my lonely
Imma get my ends I don’t need my friends in the pen of so called homies
Everytime I look over my shoulders I see the haters lurkin’
They watchin’ my every move if I happen to fail they smurkin’
But I still gotta keep my head up
Maybe the drama will let up
Even if it don’t I never give up no matter how much I’m fed up
Some people they cannot handle the struggle they thinkin’ of suicide
Damn near everybody in my city feel forgotten and deprived
But I strive
To live a better life have a reason to be alive
Whether I’m just out here sellin’ dope or I’m just workin 9 to 5

Chorus:
I’m steady strugglin’
Do what I can to keep my empty pockets bubblin’
I gotta eat so now I’m back on the corner hustlin’
Tryin’ to make it in this wicked world my life is troublin’
I’m steady strugglin’
X2….fade out
