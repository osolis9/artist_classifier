Running away
To get away,
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
You're wearing out your shoes.

Looh at you fooling you!

Making Blues Of day and night.
Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!
You're stretching out your dues.

The shorter cut is quicker,
But . . . Ha! Ha! il l Hd Time k here to stay! Look at you fooling you!

The deeper in debt
The harder You bet, Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!
Need more room to play! Look at you fooling you!

Another day
You're farther away.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
A lonpr trip back home!
