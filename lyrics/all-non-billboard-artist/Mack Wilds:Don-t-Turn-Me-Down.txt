Don-t-Turn-Me-Down:Mack Wilds
Turn the lights on

Hey Love, Hey Love
Don't tell me you changed your mind
I was hoping tomorrow morning, we wake up together
Just tell me what side is your side

Don't tell me no.
Don't tell me, Don't tell me that you feel like we're moving too fast
Don't turn me down cause we made it all the way across town
Don't tell me, Don't tell me
Can't believe that you're gonna do me like that
Don't tell me no.

Hey love, Hey love
I traveled through space and time
And I was thinking since we been drinking, we make love together
Tell me you like that plan just fine
No you didn't

Don't tell me no.
Don't tell me, Don't tell me that you feel like we're moving too fast
Don't turn me down cause we made it all the way across town
Don't tell me, Don't tell me
Can't believe that you're gonna do me like that, girl
don't tell me no.

I only here for your service
Don't tell me I make you nervous
Using flattery to comfort me somehow
That shit don't work
It's like you tease me on purpose
I promise this will be worth it

Don't turn me down
