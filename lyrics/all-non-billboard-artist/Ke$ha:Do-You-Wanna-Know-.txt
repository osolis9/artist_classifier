Do-You-Wanna-Know-:Ke$ha
I take my pain
Write it across my face
I turn it up, I play
It over and over

Until I'm feeling stripped
Straight from my fingertips
The hurt it finally flips
This weight on my shoulders

Is anybody out there
Does anyone care

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know who I am
I want you to know
I want you to know
If you really give a damn
If you want this
Be my witness
And I promise
I'll be honest
I want you to know
I want you to know
Do you wanna know

I tried so hard
And I have pushed as far
As I can let my heart
But can anyone hear me

'Cause now I'm feeling trapped
So caught up in the past
Waiting for love at last
God it's all so decieving

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know who I am
I want you to know
I want you to know
If you really give a damn
If you want this
Be my witness
And I promise
I'll be honest
I want you to know
I want you to know
Do you wanna know

Give me one reason not to hide
And I will show you all of what's inside
Give me one reason I should care
And I swear that I will
There every moment that you're there

I want you to know who I am

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know who I am
I want you to know
I want you to know
If you really give a damn

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know who I am
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know who I am
If you want this
Be my witness
And I promise
I'll be honest
I want you to know
I want you to know
Do you wanna know
