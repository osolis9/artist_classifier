We-Cry-Blood:Japhia Life
We cry blood, we got love
Fight to the death my brother, I'm not a thug
I'm a soldier, yea but I write to the thugs on the corner
Yea, cause homie they need love
We cry blood, we got love
Fight till it's done my brother, I'm not a thug
I'm a warrior, yea but I write to the thugs in the coroners
Touching their bodies like get up
This ain't for the kids, this is for adults
Todd, you might wanna come and check my pulse
TC, am I alive or what?
I just came from the battlefield riding cuz
You say you're a christian then why you scared of warfare?
You're general missing and I ain't going nowhere
My platoon has never seen defeat
We're coming soon man, read it and weap
If God is before me than who can be against me?
God is a warrior, lucifer is shifty
My homies be bucking them rugers till they're empty
Back in the hood they know I changed
If they can talk about a knife, I can talk about life
If they can talk about Allah I can talk about Christ
I spit with a passion, so this is The Passion
If you've seen that movie, you know what that's like
They say that I'm Destiny's Child like Beyonce
Jesus walks with me, but I ain't Kanye
Giving you life my brother I never change up
Japhia Life my brother you know the name, what
Was sixteen when my hat tilted
In high school every time that I rapped I killed it
It's much different than back in the days
Like Ahmad from 4th Ave. I rap for the slaves
We finally getting our reparation, I'm still giving you education
I'm still chilling with Pastor Aaron
He said we're living in Revelation
The Devil's head was down soon as he looked up
The black and the white boy done hooked up
A stop on my journey was Nashville, Tennessee
My bad folk, Cashville, Ten-a-ki
It's prejudice, believe me
On both sides, black or white believe me
So, you you see Todd and you peep Jay with him just know
This is our effort to end racism
