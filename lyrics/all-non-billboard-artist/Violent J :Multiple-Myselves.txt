Multiple-Myselves:Violent J 
Violent J:
As I lay the silence is deafening
The quiet is volume 10, it's happening again
How do I stop my brain from shaking me up?

Larry:
Oh, why you waking me up?
I'm Larry, I'm J's fear,
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be here
I hope I don't get in trouble for rapping
And I hope that girl don't get pregnant we're tapping

Violent J:
Would you mind getting out of my head when I rap?

Larry:
But what if our records are whack?
And what if I flop, man I don't know shit

Violent J:
Larry you worry about to much bullshit
Thanks for your rap though

Larry:
Was it ok?

Violent J:
Yeah, but when I rhyme they wanna hear Violent J
'Cause I deliver the swift axe chops

Plush:
Ummm, can we stop?
Hello, I'm J's soft side
He never shows affection and makes me hide
My name is Plush and I'm barely used at all

Violent J:
FUUCCKK!, what-what's happening ya'll?


(Chorus)
I have no control of me
Mood or personality
Chemical Imbalances
They control me randomly


Captivity:
What up playa? The name's Captivity
I'm J's chick boning ability
Being that we ugly it ain't a peice of cake,
but we get our fair shake

Violent J:
Mmmm, somebody help me I'm falling apart
Personalities are pouring out of my heart
Just pay me no mind, I forgot my pill today

Larry:
Are you sure we're ok?

Captivity:
Look here motherfucker, get it right
Or, we gonna be a virgin the rest of our life?

Violent J:
Why you telling them shit? Go fuck yourself

Plush:
Hey buddy, he's only trying to help
I should be mad, you never go my way

Violent J:
That's cause your a fuckin pussy ass, and I'm Violent J
But I'm not going crazy, I'm just being funny
Yeah right

Help Somebody!


(Chorus)
I have no control of me
Mood or personality
Chemical Imbalances
They control me randomly


Violent J:
Juggalos I'm sorry, I'm out of control
I got personality issues fo sho
All I ever wanted you to hear was Violent J

Fred:
Well excuse me then, I'll get out of your way

Violent J:
Wait I'm sorry Fred, Tell them about you

Fred:
Well I handle the smarts for our Mr. Bruce
I once read a book, I have a ninth grade degree
And who we kidding you don't even use me

Violent J:
Relax already, don't get pissed
You know who's probably here in the mist
All we need is Butch showing up here

Butch:
Too late pussy, throw me a beer
The name is Butch I'm J's anger, and well
Get me pissed we going to jail

Violent J:
Take it easy man, here have some NyQuil
Leave the beat downs to Billy Bill

(Chorus x2)
I have no control of me
Mood or personality
Chemical Imbalances
They control me randomly

I have no control of me
Mood or personality
Chemical Imbalances
They control me randomly

Stop Them!
