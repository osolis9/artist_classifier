Let-s-Go-Team-:The Team
All these beats
Workin' down the street
Jumping, jacking
Gimme some time
'cause if you don't, I won't
You'll never get back, yeah
If you do, I swear
I'll give it to you

Standing on the board
Board is on the wheels
Wheels are on the ground
Spinning round and round

I got the power
Back here
All you gotta do
I got the power
Back here
Gimme some time

I got here, where?
I got there, where?
I got it
You got it
We got it everywhere
Ok

Get all your loser heads up
Ok
Try to pick up the junk
Ok

Yay
