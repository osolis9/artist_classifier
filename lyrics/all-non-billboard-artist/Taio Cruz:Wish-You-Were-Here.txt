Wish-You-Were-Here:Taio Cruz
Lately, I got this feeling
I don't know what's the meaning
But I know it strong, and it's over you
All I want right now is to be home with you,
Oh oh oh oh, I'm coming right back
Oh oh oh oh, living without you is no
Oh oh oh oh, I'm coming right back
Oh oh oh oh, I wish you were here
I wish you were here
The music is better, and lights are brighter when you are near,
Am I making me clear, the music is better
And right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.

Every night, different city
Bright lights should be pretty, but they can't compare no
To the light from you.
All I want right now is to be home with you,
Oh oh oh oh, I'm coming right back
Oh oh oh oh, living without you is no
Oh oh oh oh, I'm coming right back
Oh oh oh oh, I wish you were here
I wish you were here
The music is better, and lights are brighter when you are near,
Am I making me clear, the music is better
And right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.

Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here
Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here
Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here
Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here
Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here
Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here
Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here
Oh oh I oh oh I wish you were here

Oh oh oh oh, I wish you were here
I wish you were here
The music is better, and lights are brighter when you are near,
Am I making me clear, the music is better
And right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.
Oh oh oh oh, right now I just wish you were here.
