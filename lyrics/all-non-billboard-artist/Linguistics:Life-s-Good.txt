Life-s-Good:Linguistics
It's been a mad couple of years
People saying that im changing
They're probably right but i need to give no explanation
People change, friends turns to foes
thats the cycle of life when you're living with no hesatation
late nights empty bottles of brandy
got my vision blurred
this is not how i planned
mee? 24 but cant say that loving
given a chance to go back i whould'nt change it for nothing
ah shit yeah i have my heart broke
learned my lesson now im feeling top of the class
so dont ask me why i cant put my trust in another
the only woman in my life i'll ever trust is my mother
the attitude will see me ever alone
but its hard to feel alone when you looking for your phone
dont remember those names when im taking the digits
i save em as the hair color plus the name of the city
but life is good

im moving up im moving up
and everything around me changes
but life is good its all good
im moving up im moving up
and everything around me changes

but life is good its all good

these girls want to get into my head
i see the world through my eyeballs
set along the beat like needle to a vinyl
and if it skippes ill predict it im so quick with this lyric business
and i could never freeze for a minute
so, close your eyes.
now the beat becomes a part of you
lost in the moment
now i said it isnt hard to do
so remarkable believe me because you can not see me
doesnt meen im not here like im half the moon
i got love for anyone that been a friend to me
all the memories
and everything that changed
nah it wasnt ment to be
but something that could never change in time
is what you ment to me
yeah so pour a drink out
to anyone who ever been around when i was feeling down

to anyone who ever asked me why i seemed distant
to anyone who ever sat with me and just listened
life is good

im moving up im moving up
and everything around me changes
but life is good its all good
im moving up im moving up
and everything around me changes
but life is good its all good
im moving up im moving up
and everything around me changes
but life is good its all good
im moving up im moving up
and everything around me changes
but life is good its all good
