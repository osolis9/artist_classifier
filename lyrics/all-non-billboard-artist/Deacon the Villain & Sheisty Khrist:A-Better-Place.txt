A-Better-Place:Deacon the Villain & Sheisty Khrist
it's 窶話out to go down
i'm talking 窶話out a better place
where your eyes will see more
more than ever before
into space

It's 窶話out to go down
I'm talkin 窶話out a better place
what is evil and good?
all my people you should have a taste

can you magine a world
no violence?
no lie or sin?
to picture this might need to wipe your lens
get high
ascend
ain't talkin mary jane or vicatin
my pious friends
but still we gliding like we lie on wind
imagine
we could appreciate our different ways
our different races weren't racing towards the end of days
our different faces faced the weather with amazing grace
and this the basis 'til we placing satan in his grave
now now
every day
in this maze
where we hustle
where we play
where we struggle
in the shade
everybody wait for that sound

so how to we respect ourselves?
and check our selves?
when it's so easy just wreck ourselves
neglect our health
sometimes in life I set the bar too low
ain't that fa show
and when that fear creeps in I'm out the do'
to the corna sto'
to get my beer or my bourbon
to put that weed in my pipe
call up my cuddliest buddy to get my mind off of life
sometimes I'm lost in his study
sometimes I'm lost in the night
sometimes I'm runnin with no end game in site
from light
every day
in this maze
where we hustle
where we pray
where we struggle
in the shade
everybody wait for that sound

remember
the power's in you
for peace
from night
to be
the light
remember
mountains will move
the price
the bite
won't stop
your life
it's 'bout to go down
