Stay-Single-:Tyrese
No one ever said it'd be easy baby
Girl I wanna take the time and thank you
Just for putting up with me
And I'm sorry that you even had to deal with me

And even though I made you cry, I wanna make it right
Just give me some time to make it right
I go the extra mile to make you smile
And just to make your day

I'll go out my way
I'll do whatever it takes

Baby promise you'll stay, stay
Stay baby, would you just
Stay, stay, baby, stay, stay, stay with me
Baby won't you stay with me?

I know that I messed up over a thousand times
Said you wouldn't forgive me but somehow I changed your mind
And now that we're here, I just can't let you go
And now I got you here, baby girl, I gotta let you know

I go the extra mile to make you smile and
Just to make your day
I'll go out my way
I'll do whatever it takes

Baby, would you just stay
Stay, baby, baby won't you stay
Stay right here with me, baby
Stay with me, hey

Girl I need you in my world
I want you to always be my girl
Even though I messed up, ooh, I'm effed up
You took good care, always took care of me

Baby would you just stay
Stay, stay right here
Stay, baby won't you stay with me
Put the bags down, let's work it out baby

Stay, stay, baby, I want you to believe in me this time
This time, this time, I'ma get it together
Stay, stay, what about the marriage life
You were supposed to be my wife
