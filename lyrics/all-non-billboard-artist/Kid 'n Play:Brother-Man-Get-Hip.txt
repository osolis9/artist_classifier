Brother-Man-Get-Hip:Kid 'n Play
We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip

We dropped and left it on the program, this ain't a slow jam
Frustratin' rappers with our dope jam
I mean a record we can all dance to
And at the same time prove our point to you

Forget the clean-cutted
Kid 'N play don't play, this time we're comin' rough and rugged
You're rappin' like a Sunday driver, who's comin' liver?
Kid 'N Play, Play and Kid, two survivors

Kid on the mic, add Play to make it greater
It's see you later alligator when Wiz rocks the fader
Listen to the rhyme 'cause I'm gonna pass the time
He's gonna blast your mind 'cause I'm a mastermind

I'm steady slayin', preyin', you'll be stayin', friend
Watch what you're sayin' when, it's Kid 'N Play again
Pumpin' and jumpin', you know that I'm a go-getter
Stop frontin' and stuntin', boy, you know you just better

Remember the face, remember the voice
Remember Kid 'N Play when it comes to the choice
For MC of the year, one down the roster
Open up the envelope, give us the Oscar

Yo, we'll keep it pumpin' tough, we'll give you somethin' rough
So stop your frontin' 'cause, you know it's us
We're a duo and you don't know just who you're messin' with
So stop you're guessin', kids, here's what the message is

We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip

Now I'm the Kid, oh, did you know it?
I had to show it that I was a cool, keen, freestyle poet
I glide and stride with pride, Play's by my side
Just chillin' along for the ride

Now it's the capital K I D, this is my ID
My rhyme history on the M I C
Will show I know how to flow
On the mic I strike a blow and throw toe to toe

Brothers wanna own what I write and use my strategy
I bust a rhyme on the mic and they get mad at me
The light-skinned brother takin' no shorts
Yo, who is that rappin' on contact sport?

I ain't tellin' it, records, keep sellin' it
Y'all keep yellin' to the rhythm that's so compellin'
That's right, on the mic what we're sayin' is vital
Kid 'N Play, the new matinee idols

You know what time it is, that's our claim to fame
You know who our producer is, don't have to say his name
Let it be known, yeah, there'll be a scandal, see
If you're dissed, we're idol makers family

So get hip to this, we're equipped for this
Built for speed indeed, so just skip to this
Rhythm is what we give 'em to keep em steady
Count it off, 1 2 3 4, are you ready?

See 'cause I'm goin' for mine
Boy, you know the time, partners in rhyme
Musically attached to a beat that swings
Kid 'N Play are here runnin' things

Ain't talkin' 'bout another man so brother man get hip to this
And just do the Kid 'N Play kick step to this
We're givin' you exactly what you want again
So don't you front again, we'll tell you once again

We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip
We want brother man to get hip
