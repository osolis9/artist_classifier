Goin-Far:Quez
(Hook)
I ain’t goin far
But every time I’m in this foreign car
I feel like a porn star
‘Cus all these ladies wanna fuck me
I’m speakin like the pretty bad girl
And I ain’t goin far
Yea… yea…
And I ain’t goin far

(Verse)
Man I’m feelin like goin out
Them ladies goin crazy when I pull that foreign out
That bitch 200, watch where you goin now
Now that’s what I be tellin valets when I’m goin out, for real
Coupe tinted, nigga who in it?
Rich nigga, in it to win it
Can I get a minute?
Shawty said she wanted to kick it
Told er get in, she put her bags in the engine, for real
She got me trippin
She got me swerving, she keeps showin naked pictures
Now I got work
One hand on that steering wheel, the other hand on that pussy
And I almost crashed the whip
Cus I wasn’t looki, goddamn

(Hook)
I ain’t goin far
But every time I’m in this foreign car

And I ain’t goin far
Yea… yea…
And I ain’t goin far

(Verse)
Okay I’m feelin it whippin, I feel the adrenaline
I’m doin 100, if I crash then we finished
Maybe jet but we trippin, we be home in a minute
In the room you can get my undivided attention
Now let me roll it, I saw it
Gossips only to show me
She wanna fuck to some Too $hort
Then smoke to E-40
She wanna drink to some Outkast and fight to some Scrappy
Wanna drive some Drizzy and hit the club to some Trappy
And I’mma give it to er
Lil mama want it so bad, I’m bout to give it to er yea
Nigga where my phone?
I’m up and out it then I’m on my way home
Yea girl I’m going home
