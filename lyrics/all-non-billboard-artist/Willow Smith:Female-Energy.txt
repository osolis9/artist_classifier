Female-Energy:Willow Smith
I just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions, like where did I come from
I know, I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago
years ago
years ago
years ago
I do my close and then I get so lost
Light just take my
sphere to go
sphere to go
sphere to go
sphere to go
To the top of the pyramid let's save the world like this
Conversing with live bodies, but really they're all apart of me
Let's get the whip and go, cuz I'm tired of this solar ring

It's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I do not want you to go, but I don't know how to stop you

Whatever, whatever I guess whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever

Cuz it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go, but I do not want to stop you

Cuz you gone do what you got to do
And what I do is not your problem
Just let me let me love you
Stop trying to make it complicated

Really out of my control
What I do is not your problem
I really want to go
But please, please don't stop me
