Fly-Love:Jamie Foxx
Wasn't really thinking,
Wasn't looking
Wasn't searching for an answer
In the moonlight
When I saw your face

Saw you looking at me,
Saw you peeking
Out from under moon beams
Through the palm trees,
Swaying in the breeze

I know I'm feeling so much more
Than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you
Than I thought I could do

Don't know how it happened
Don't know why but you don't really
Need a reason
When the stars shine
Just to fall in love

Made to love each other,
Made to be together
For a life time
In the sunshine
Flying in the sky

I know I'm feeling so much more
Than ever before
And so I'm giving more to you
Than I thought I could do,

Oh...

Now I know love is real
So when sky high
As the angels try
Leaving you and I,
Fly love...
