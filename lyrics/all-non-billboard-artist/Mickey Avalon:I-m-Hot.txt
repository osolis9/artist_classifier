I-m-Hot:Mickey Avalon
ce, life is short let me cut to the chase
I like, pain and pleasure and leather and lace
I never say never and I never come fake
Baby give me that treasure, come and sit on my face

Your momma ain't home
Your daddy ain't home
I said your momma ain't home and your daddy ain't home so let's have a party tonight

I'm Hot
Open up the window take off your clothes
I'm Hot
Run the cool water to cool us off
I'm hot
Turn up the AC disconnect the phone
I'm Hot [x3] Ooh!

D-d-d-d-do it, d-d-d-d-do it again

The time is now and the place is here
And I'm the one who's gonna make you face your fears
I ain't a sadist but I'd like to taste your tears
I'll make you cum baby and then I'll disappear

Your momma ain't home
Your daddy ain't home
I said your momma ain't home and your daddy ain't home so let's have a party tonight

I'm Hot
Open up the window take off your clothes
I'm Hot
Run the cool water to cool us off
I'm hot
Turn up the AC disconnect the phone
I'm Hot [x3] Ooh!

D-d-d-d-do it, d-d-d-d-do it again [x2]

If you can call your friends and their friends call their friends
And then, in the end, we do it again [x2]

I'm Hot
Open up the window take off your clothes
I'm Hot
Run the cool water to cool us off
I'm hot
Turn up the AC disconnect the phone
I'm Hot [x3] Ooh!

I'm Hot
Open up the window take off your clothes
I'm Hot

Turn up the AC disconnect the phone
