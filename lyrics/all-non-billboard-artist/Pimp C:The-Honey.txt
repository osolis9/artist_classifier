Put the 'P' in the pimp, brought back the blue to the flame
Break a bitch like a trig, write out some magical shit
And while I feel more slim, that ain't my starter bitch

Drop the top on the Rolls and roll under the sun
Throw my finger in the air like, kid', hoe I'm the one
Got my gators and suits, multiple colors like fruit
Pimp aroma on my breath, Tropicana and goose

To the roots of pianos, see my moves she can't handle
H.B.O., nigga hoe break up overtime Soprano
Diamonds up against panels of wood, it's all good
Lean back, candy 'llac gettin' head on my hood
