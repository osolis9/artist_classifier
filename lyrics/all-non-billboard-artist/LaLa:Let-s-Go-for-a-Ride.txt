Let-s-Go-for-a-Ride:LaLa
I've been around this place
A million times
Letting this idle hours passing me by
I'm looking for a new destination

I wanna Go
Beyond my imagination
So jump on board
No need to think what's
Gonna happen tomorrow

Let's go, Let's go
Let's go for a ride
Relax your mind
Come on now, Let's go for a ride

Tired of looking outside the window
Baby come out
It's time to explore
Let's embark on a new adventure
Take my hand and don't let go

Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go for a ride
Relax your mind
It feels so right
Let's have a good time
Enjoy this ride

It's a beautiful view
I'm seeing the best side of you
It's a beautiful view
I'll cherish this moment I have with you

Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go for a ride
Relax your mind
It feels so right
Let's have a good time
Enjoy this ride

Let's go for a ride
Let's go for a ride

I'll take you around the word
I'll be your only girl
Baby just enjoy the ride
This is the time of our live

Come on, come on
Come on
Enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride
