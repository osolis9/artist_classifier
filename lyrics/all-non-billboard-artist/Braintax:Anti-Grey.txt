Anti-Grey:Braintax
Live from the horse's mouth
And the rich move south
Can't sell coffee, better work it out
Get that fair trade magic beans in your well-fed mouth
You know how like old Reg and Gladys
Little English crumbled, with all in drought
Dried up goodwill across the whole department
Get the Irish scam bills and mark 'em
Don't be watching for red by the tunnel
Better hold up (hold up!)
Whole yard, prize water, spot the actress
Detection of movement, the checks in the process
Checks get processed, so this is progress
What a mess! Let's see the facts
NOTW and Sun
It didn't like cox van text?
I believe hell's built by the public specs
Don't terry and keifer?
On the coasters, Living it up
Getting drunk, cause a ruckus
Now be needing a bandage in the
A and E
Cussing like F the lamb?
All we want is beer and tapas
All we want is beer and tapas
Britain's for the British mate, back to the days
Of the Empire state when Britannia ruled the waves
But the slaves are coming back home to roost
Welcomed by immigration officers with shiny boots
And they want it so bad that they're running
Through the channel tunnel barefoot
Fuck it mate, cheap labour, work late
BNP
a brand new target to hate
So the refugee took the heat off me
Its cool with me damn straight
Way I see it, we was made on basics
White black and grey mix
Politics? Nah mate, bollocks its 'politricks'
Talk shit, say what you wanna hear, get the vote
Get rich, tax more, your poor. we're not, Haha
War on terrorism, blah blah...
Look what I'm trying to say is that the government are hustlers.
don't fade to grey
