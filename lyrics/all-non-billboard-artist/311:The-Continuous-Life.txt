The-Continuous-Life:311
When things are outta whack and they might collapse
And at the end of the day you still can't relax
And physically, you ache like a cavity
Feeling the bind all on your mind and the rest of your body

Listen to your heartbeat, flow and imagine
Become Jackson Pollack, airbrush Chinese dragons
Or a sky-blue conversion van or an Electra
Buick of the mind full of luminous matter

And slowly all the pressure recedes and you stop to decay
Naturally, think clearly
Ultimately through your grace will give way to traffic jams
Submachine guns in hand

City rednecks who think like the Omega Man
Feelin' the extremes of the times we're livin'
Stockpile Spaghetti-O's and Cheerios
Tryin' to survive that fallout shit

It's not ambiguous to be continuous
It's all about us, it's for real my man
The continuous life, there is no end
Movin' through life, movin' through death

It's not ambiguous to be continuous
It's all about us, it's for real my man
The continuous life, there is no end
Movin' through life, movin' through death

A radio emits a signal for
A loud noise the kind of which I've never heard before
I scan the dial for more stations
But all I get is an eerie feelin'
I'm not dreamin', this is the real dealin'

There's nothing like this trance, I'm caught in the daze
'Cause I'm finally out of my body, the blue lights are ablaze
Yeah, I'm really amazed and feelin' so light, that's right
Lift off and I'm into the sky

As if a hologram were created to shift my consciousness
Changed again and I'm flung in the riff
Yeah, I wanna be free, I wanna do right
I move through the portal to be purified

It's not ambiguous to be continuous
It's all about us, it's for real my man
The continuous life, there is no end
Movin' through life, movin' through death

It's not ambiguous to be continuous
It's all about us, it's for real my man
The continuous life, there is no end
Movin' through life, movin' through death

Lord, wish I could spin we be continuous
Just to feel man, yeah for real
The continuous life, there is no end
Movin' through life, movin' through death
