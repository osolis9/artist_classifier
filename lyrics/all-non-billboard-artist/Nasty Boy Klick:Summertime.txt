Summertime:Nasty Boy Klick
Summertime is here and it feels so good
Kickin' it, rollin' through my neighborhood
Music is bumpin' and the girlies look so fine
I just her, I just love the summertime

Yo wat's up to all my homies in the world today?
I gotta summertime jam that I must display
Kinda tastes like a piece of pie so you can savor
Yo J, one more time so they can get the flavor

Summertime is here and it feels so good
Kickin' it, rollin' through my neighborhood
Music is bumpin' and the girlies look so fine
I just her, I just love the summertime

Wakin' up this-a mornin', jump out of bed
I gotta summertime thought creepin' through my head
Thinkin' of the past and the stuff we used to do
