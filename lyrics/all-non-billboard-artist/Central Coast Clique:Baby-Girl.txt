Baby-Girl:Central Coast Clique
Ooh my my my my my my ooh oh babe
Check it babygirl I'm the one you been needing
And the one and only man that you could trust and believe in
You brought light into my cold and lonely life
And one day I'll ask you to be my wife that's right
Settle down and make love all night
Cause your the one that make the dominator feel alright
And if you ever have to wonder about my love
Your always in my heart I can't explain enough
With you beautiful face and your lovely smile
A kiss from your lips to drive me wild
I never had another girl like you
To make me feel this way and do the things I do
You got me wrapped around your finger like a wedding band
Every night I hope and pray to god that I'm your only man
Let's make it last between the two of us
I'm a good man for life when we joined as one

Your the only one I think about dream about
Oh babygirl you should never have to have a doubt
Cause in your heart you should know that my love is true
So forget about them other cause my minds on you

I might get high or on the streets with my peeps
And even act a fool with my homies rolling deep
But devotion is provided for my family
And the love I have for them is unconditional see
That includes the triple C cause we're one in the same
Start talking pedo then catch one in the brain
And I say this without shame I put it on my life
You will die for messing with my kids and my wife
Cause they all that I have so there's no turning back
Flipping fat stacks smoke on bomb kronic sack
Just to maintain in a world of pain
Gotta hustle and stuggle before we gain
My intentions are real and this is the deal
Me and D don't stop until we hear the meal
Let me say this what we have is all good
Cause everything is going like it should in this hood

Your the only one I think about dream about
Oh babygirl you should never have to have a doubt
Cause in your heart you should know that my love is true
So forget about them other cause my minds on you

Between me and you it's all good I don't lie
Never will you catch me looking at another guy
I can't believe that I'm in love for the first time
Head over heels when you asked me to be your wife
You like a wish come true
Every night when I sleep I would dream for a man like you
But now your here the man of my dreams so it seems
We make love to the morning night 33
Then I'm off to work once again
But tonight will be another night of kissing and hugging and loving
I had a few different boyfriends in the past
But no other can compare to the love we have

Your the only one I think about dream about
Oh babygirl you should never have to have a doubt
Cause in your heart you should know that my love is true
So forget about them other cause my minds on you
