Lorrydriver:Chris Moyles
You're a man 
Who knows exactly where he's goin'
On the road 
With all your eighteen wheels a' rollin'

You deliver milk or sand 
or pigs or paint across the land 
That's what you do 
What you do, mister 

A workin' man 
You drive a wagon for a livin'
Arrive on time 
Cos that's important when deliverin' 

Bread or bikes or garden chairs 
or sheds or beds or dancing bears 
That's what you do 
What you do, mister 

Lorry driver, lorry, lorry driver 
You're a lorry driver 
Oh, lorry driver, oh 
You're a lorry driver, mister 

Horn, get out of 
Horn Horn, the way 
Lorry driver, lorry driver 
Lorry driver 

Eating sausage rolls and cornish pasties 
crisps and jaffa cakes 
Drinking coffee and some red bull 
on your scheduled tacho breaks 

You work away 
For several days 
Life on the road 
You're a lorry driver 

Live behind the wheel 
You drive from Devon up to Aberdeen 
Pull off at the services 
for diesel and nuts magazine 

You read the Sun 
And have a saggy bum 
Everyone can tell 
You're a lorry driver 

Trucker man 
You crunch the miles to make a dollar 
It's just a shame 
You've got the body of Rik Waller 

You should be on Slimfast 
You spend your life sat on your ass 
But that's the way it is 
The way it is mister 

Off you go 
You've had a kip and had your dinner 
And hung up your 
New centerfold of Lucy Pinder 

You're the greatest driver 
Fuelled by Yorkie bars and Tizer 
That's the way you roll 
The way you roll mister 

Lorry driver, lorry, lorry driver 
You're a lorry driver 
Oh, lorry driver, oh 
You're a lorry driver, mister 

Horn, get out of 
Horn Horn, the way 
Lorry driver, lorry driver 
Lorry driver 

Eating sausage rolls and cornish pasties 
Crisps and jaffa cakes 
Drinking coffee and some Red Bull 
on your scheduled tacho breaks 

You work away 
For several days 
Life on the road 
You're a lorry driver 

Live behind the wheel 
You drive from Devon up to Aberdeen 
Pull off at the services 
For diesel and Nuts Magazine 

You read the Sun 
And have a saggy bum 
Everyone can tell 
You're a Lorry Driver 

Maybe if I didn't drive a truck for my work 
My wife would look like Jordan rather than Pauline Quirke 
And she does a bit, a little bit 

Lorry driver, lorry, lorry driver 
You're a lorry driver 
Oh, lorry driver, oh 
You're a lorry driver, mister 

Horn, get out of
