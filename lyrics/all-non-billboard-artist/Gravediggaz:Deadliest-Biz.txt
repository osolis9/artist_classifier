Deadliest-Biz:Gravediggaz
Yo, don't bother me kid
Let a nigga live plus eat
Bless the wiz and protect my seed

I filter distortion like a magnet, attract rappin' bandits
Stretch 'em and blast 'em over the canvas
Blatant replies to that blast my exercise
Won't be televised, due to the rise of spirits

Or my transparent perseverance, fuck a publishers clearance
Gate keep's runnin' interference
Yo, you can dissect it, the black prospecta
I'm cold as a pirate's luger

Choke on my hymic maneuver, I breathe life in the fire
When my designs are tight like pliers,  born in a pillow of barbed wire
Taught by Ebenezer Scrooge in my mom's church choir
The death stalker, New York trendtogrophy
The G O D, 120 degree geography

The bomb thick iron skin without a blemish
Black art of war chemist
Carry out the death sentence with deadly vengeance
What I'm seekin' is your head on a skillet

Soakin' in burgundy liquid, self inflected wounds fill pounds
In Grant's tomb and more damage than a monsoon
Niggas explodin' like aquatic moons, I mutate your functions
Like a divine evil after midnight in Broadway junction

Keep it pumpin', yo, yo, yo
Anything you're given can be taken away
Any place anywhere anytime any day

Gravedigga forever, so, whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But yo can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and still not get blast in the heart

You're just a weaklin', seekin' to peep Grym's steelo
I sting like mosquitoes, ten times as lethal
The skill of my tongue is similar to Attila the Hun
Swingin' a sword Grym is gruesome, world renown like hunger

The mighty hunter in the concrete junga, doper than ganja
Conquer any style you can conjure
Take your momma's breath away like anacondas
Fronters get cast asunder lightening fast I bring thunder

Ancient rules blast the mic
Crushin' fools paradise leavin' you parasites
Underground, beef is shredded, paramedics'll greet you
I defeat crews with parametric EQ's

All types of anastetics'll be used, my pressure's like
The barometric when I squeeze you, removed of this earthly ball of clay
Let the chips fall where they may, I'll be servin' you all day, everyday
Consider you a serious threat, anyway

Gravedigga forever, so, whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and not get blast up in the heart

Gravedigga forever, so, whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and not get blast up in the heart

What, yo?
(Yo)
Gravediggaz
(Forever)
'97 and beyond word is bond
(Beyond, word is bond)

Keep, keep, keepin' it on to the break of dusk to dawn
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Rzarector, Undertaker, Gatekeeper, the Grym Reaper
Yo, caught you in the sleeper, Gravediggaz forever
