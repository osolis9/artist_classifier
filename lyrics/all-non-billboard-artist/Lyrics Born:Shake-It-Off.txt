Shake-It-Off:Lyrics Born
My woman left me out to twist in the wind
She just left on a whim and ain't nothin' I can do about it
She left me with a fistful of bills
Not a crisp dollar bill, what the hell am I gon' do about it

Had our differences, I can't believe
This is how she would leave and even get to speak about it
Eleven minutes, seven hours and a week
When I was last asleep, it's when she left me, come to think about it

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams, yeah

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams, uh

The other night ago the boss called me late
Wants to talk 'bout some thangs, Monday morning come and see about it
I feel it y'all my job's about to go, feelin' throbs in my skull
My God I couldn't sleep about it

He told me that I'm lost on my tracks
Gonna cost me my job, is something we can do about it?
Motherfucker's got the balls to complain with all that I gave
Said do what you gotta do about it

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams, yeah

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
Hands in the air y'all

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams, yeah

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
Throw your belongings

Now I lay me down to sleep, yeah
Pray the Lord my soul to keep, same one
If I die before I wake, what
Pray the Lord my soul to take, come on

Now I lay me down to sleep, yeah
Pray the Lord my soul to keep, same one
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take, hey, oh

Sydney, hands in the air

Every night I toss and turn in my sleep
And it hurts when I breathe, I'm gettin' a little worried 'bout it
Combination on the stress and the strain, I ain't slept now for days
And I just can't get my head around it

All the drama in the world that we live
We learn how to give, I can't sit back and do nothin' 'bout it
Wanna know whatever happened to love, compassion and drugs
'Cause it seem like we forgot about it

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams, oh

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams, yeah

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams, oh

One time, shake it off
Two times, shake it off
Three times, shake it off
These bad dreams
