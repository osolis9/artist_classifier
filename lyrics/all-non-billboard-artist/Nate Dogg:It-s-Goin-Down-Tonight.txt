It-s-Goin-Down-Tonight:Nate Dogg
It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight
It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight

You must be a special lady, I know
'Cause everywhere we go
You always bring attention to me
You gotta be a special lady, fo' sho', I know
I love the way you makin' me tweak, ooh baby

Love the outfit you're wearin', that's dope
Just as sure as chronic makes me choke
Girl, I never ever want you to leave, hey lady
Would you like to go and see a movie? Let's go
I hope we can make another movie tonight, ooh baby

First, we'll get in the Jacuzzi, no clothes, I know
In a minute I'll be lickin' you dry, hey
The next scene is really amazing, no joke
You prone, girl, it's on

It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight
It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight

The love I'm tryin' to give is better than a one night stand
They say you're a hell of a woman well, I can be a hell of a man
The way you stole my heart I'd even cook you breakfast in bed
And you don't have to move a muscle just lay back and relax, chill

It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight
It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight

It seems like only yesterday, I first met you
Gray skies turned blue, I wish I knew
Why do you always hesitate? What did I do?
All I wanna do is be with you, baby, can it go down?

It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight
It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight

It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
If you have the time, it's goin' down tonight
It's goin' down tonight, I'll do your body right
