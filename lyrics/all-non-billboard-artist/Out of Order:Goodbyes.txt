Goodbyes:Out of Order
You tell me actions, speak louder
But there's something about her words that hurt

Closing up its so late and
I'm the last one, still waiting for you to unlock the door

On our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm brewing in his eyes, only veiled by a thin disguise

And now that I've done my time
I, I need to move on and I need you to try
Cuz we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes

Never asked you to change, but sadly you don't feel the same about me
I wonder does your man, still shudder when you touch his hand, like this man

And on our way home I realize
There is some kind of storm brewing in his eyes,
Only veiled by a thin disguise

Now that I've done my time, I, I need to move on
And I need you to try
Cuz we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes, we're out of goodbyes
