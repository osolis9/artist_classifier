Let-s-Get-Married:PARTYNEXTDOOR 
I've finally realized what I need
Can only be royal if you loyal girl
And all I need is a woman who will wanna agree with everything that I do
And get naked for me when I want her to
All I need, make it feel like forever
When it's temporary, let's get married

Just cause this moment deserves a moment
Just cause this moment, deserves a moment
Let's get married, let's get married
I'mma get drunk enough and get crazy enough
To say something just as crazy as let's get married
Let's get married, let's get married

Still I need me a freak, I'm coming straight out of Montego Bay
You working seven days a week
I know how you feel cause I feel the same
We put the same shit in our brain
Not with that molly, coked up on Dolly
All that you need is some green girl you a rockstar when with me
Girl I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, you sometimes feel outta' control
But baby you know that this moment deserves a moment

Just cause this moment, deserves a moment
Let's get married, let's get married
I'mma get drunk enough and get crazy enough
To say something just as crazy as let's get married
Let's get married, let's get married

I've finally realized, can only be, if you loyal
Need, need, need
When it's temporary, moment
Deserves a, moment, deserves a
Let's get married, let's get married
