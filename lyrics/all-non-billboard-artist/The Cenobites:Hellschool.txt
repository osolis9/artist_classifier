Hellschool:The Cenobites
The bell is ringing, the kis are singing
The schoolyear starts today
They enter the classroom, entering their doom
It's the teatcher's first day
Parents, mind your kids
Cause teatcher is a bitch
Parents mind your young
Or else they won't make it long
Forgot your homework
Then you will pay the price
Alway stand in line and behave just fine
Cause teacher is not nice

Parents, mind your kids
Cause teatcher is a bitch
Parents mind your young
Or else they won't make it long
She will knock you out and blow your brains out
F'you won't do what she says
Finish your work, speak with two words
She'll leave you in a mess

Parents, mind your kids
Cause teatcher is a bitch
Parents mind your young
Or else they won't it long
