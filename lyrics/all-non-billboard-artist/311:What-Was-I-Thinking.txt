What-Was-I-Thinking:311
The word that I heard was so absurd
I can't believe it slipped from my lips
The tongue from which it was sung was so dumb
I wish to pull it from my skull

What the fuck was I thinking?

The word that I heard was so absurd
I can't believe it slipped from my lips
The tongue from which it was sung was so dumb
I wish to pull it from my skull
