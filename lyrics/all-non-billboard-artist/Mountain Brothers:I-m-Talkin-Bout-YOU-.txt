I-m-Talkin-Bout-YOU-:Mountain Brothers
Take these words, think it through

I'm nasty raw, I'm a planet you're an asteroid
Gave your mom another shot at life she asked to abort
Tap your jaws, get out the door or I might wax yours
After I mack your whore you'll say that's the last straw
Yeah I'm dope arrogant, that's the whole fucking point
You're like, "That motherfucking bastard, Styles, hats off!"
You thought, what? Nah, that's not a rational thought
I'm extraordinary, you're mastering?
When this task force attacks before you react you lost
Hate you fake frauds make you pay the cost
When I lay the law down atheists praise the lord
Half the shit you cats talk you don't do, that's soft
Had your jawn, she had all of my joints
Smacked that ass back and forth like a basketball court
You could try to rap something but you're wack of course
You're record got a solid dot in consumer report

If you don't elevate hiphop and ain't saying nothing new
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
If you take this personal and you getting irate
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
If you're decent off the top but can't write a fucking rhyme
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
And if you think that I might be talking bout you
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!

Son step up if you don't wanna survive
Your style ain't really working like cats a quarter to five
Thought you were fly, what's worse is you honestly tried
Took your heart your pride left you in a corner to cry
My style you bit. If you didn't, you're thinking it admit it
You're on my diddy, while all you dirty hoes be at the clinic
Faking moves, talking shit that ain't even the truth
Don't make me introduce your sphincter to my boot
I don't give a flying fuck if you're signed or what
A deal with big buck records, guess what? You still SUCK!
Styles Infinite, steady pulling cats' cards
You think you're dope cuz you're average in a below average squad
Wanna diss but can't approach. Hiding like a phantom ghost
An emperor in your mind. In life, no skills and no flows
My name is Styles, daily dissing wack bitches
I tapped the mistress. Yes, I have pictures
I hate non-creating, non-contemplating wannabe emcees
That's afraid to state the truth, and if that category fits then I'm
talking bout you

If you're still talking about fashion and clothes
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
If you're a half ass rapper with half ass shows
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
If you used to be dope and now you fell the fuck off
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
And if there's one nice rapper in your whole crew and it ain't you
I'm talking bout you!
If you think that you're nice but you really ain't really nice
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
If you ain't feeling my style but still listening to this record
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
And if for once just for kicks, I'm talking bout you
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!
If you think you're up here when you're really down here
Guess what? I'm talking bout you!

Take this words, think it through

BIATCH!
