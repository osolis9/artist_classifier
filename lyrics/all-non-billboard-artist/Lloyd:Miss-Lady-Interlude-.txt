Miss-Lady-Interlude-:Lloyd
Your in my life*
Everyday
And barkin' at every little thing I do
It's because of you
I'm the man that I am
And no one
Can ever replace your love
Your my auntie
My sister
My mother
Sharin' my story unlike no other
Stay as amazing as you are
Stay as beautiful as you are
Stay as strong as you are

Miss lady
Miss lady
As lovely as a girl could be
Miss lady
Your lovin means the world to me
Miss lady
The reason that I got this far
Whenever times got hard
You pulled me out the dark
