High-Times:Jamiroquai
You don't need your name in bright lights, you're a rock star
And some thin foil with a glass pipe is your guitar, now, yes it is
Little Angela suffers delusions from these high times
She's been cleanin' up since fourteen on the main line

And her hunky, funky, junky of a boyfriend
Got her on late nights with her skirt tight
Oh, she's a wild thing, oh, letting it all swing
God, bless our high times

Don't you know that last night turned to daylight?
And a minute became a day
Last night all my troubles, well, they seemed so, so far away
Oh now, searchin' my reflection for a glimpse of another me
I've got to get away from these high times
'Cause these high times are killin' me

Now high times go on and on and on
High times rock your mind, yeah

This twisted crystal kingdom where you live your nine lives
And your head spins purple cyclones made of dexadrine
And when the phone rings, you think bad things
Well, these are high, high, high, high times, yeah
In any backstreet when you take a hot seat
Make sure you check your flight times, oh now mama

Last night turned to daylight and a minute became a day
Last night, all my troubles, well, they seemed so, so far away
Oh, searchin' my reflection for a glimpse of another me
I've got to get away from all these high times
'Cause these high times are killin' me

Rock on and on and on and on and on
High times to rock your mind
Now drop it this time

Paranoia will destroy ya, paranoia will destroy ya
Paranoia will destroy ya, paranoia, paranoia this time

Last night turned to daylight and a minute became a day
Last night all my troubles, well, they seemed so, so far away
Searchin' my reflection for a glimpse of another me
I've got to get away from all these high times, oh
'Cause these sure are killin' me

La la la la la la, high times, oh yeah, ooh
We're living in high high high times, yeah

Last night turned to daylight and in a moment we've forgot the way
Time is so precious when you throw your life away
Ooh, I can't be livin' it up, lettin' it all go wrong
I can't be living these white lies, knowin' my life has gone

Kids wanna give it up, kids wanna give it up
Time to let your mind be free, searching for eternity
Kids wanna give it up, kids wanna give it up
Time to let your mind be free, searching for eternity
Kids wanna give it up, kids wanna give it up
Time to let your mind be free, searching for eternity
Kids wanna give it up, kids wanna give it up
Yeah, oh, alright
