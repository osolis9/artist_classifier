Another Day
another day
staring out of my window
thinkin' bout tomorrow
wishing things would clear

no need to rush
i ain't gonna work
any moment my sorrow
is bound to disappear

chorus:
sometime i tell myself
i'm better off without you
and i have to face emptiness
i feel inside without you
and find a way to make it through another day

i need a way
to find the truth within me
accept the fact that i love you
my blue eternety

i hear they say
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
i must have the heart of a lion
sifting through love's remains

chorus

my love for you is etched
forever in my memory
now i realize that life goes on
even though you're not here with me
i wake up looking forward to another day
a day of living without you
i can't stand living without you
just another day
