Gamble-Your-Life:Molemen
[** feat. Pugslee Atomz:]


[Verse 1:]
What's the deal tho'/dildo like sex toys*
You wanna loose respect boy?
Cause I can break backs and use you as a place mat
I smack you with an Almanac
So you can fuckin' face facts
Nacrobats is fresh and your crew is ridin' straight wack
If you thinkin' you're hotter hold your flames for ransom black
I'm a handsome black while you sound a bit Hanson black
I stay wreckin' it with nice battle etiquette
Ask you how you wanna get ripped
Punchlines or some street shit?
I say names for bitches
Fuck the street shit
You're just an MC on weekends always surrounded by weaklings
I'm rhymin' for the week's end
Seven days a week man
Got word play and a game of it with her last weekend
Your freestyle is shallow while mine is off the fuckin' deep end
With no life guards, you need recitative breathin'
Inhale
Now I'm smokin' heathens
I guess you believin' in a legend and be leavin'

[Chorus] [x4]
Sterling Price not being nice is like no dots on dice
You wanna gamble your life
Bring your ass to the mic

Every time I open my mouth I bring my bank card

[Verse Two]
When I ball you might lose an eyeball cause I'm one of the tightest
With big balls like elephantiasis
Mic devices is a friend of ours
Closed stations like yards in prison guards
Sending your crew back with no self esteem is our calling card
? till the days me and skills depart
I'm from a time when cats battle at night at ?
I'm takin' out doubles like open mics at Noah's Ark
I'm takin' out doubles like drunks at city bars
With preciseness of a surgeon 
So don't be alarmed
If you awaken and I'm holdin' a
Scalpel and a dog
It just means I'm tryin' to see if you really got heart
If come back and you talk cause my fam will bandage 'em all
Cause when my fist hits your face
That's when your teeth are lost

[Chorus] [x4]
Sterling Price not being nice is like no dots on dice
You wanna gamble your life
Bring your ass to the mic

Every time I open my mouth I bring my bank card
