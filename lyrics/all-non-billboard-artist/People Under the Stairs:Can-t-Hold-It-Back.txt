Can-t-Hold-It-Back:People Under the Stairs
In fame we don't lust in funk we do trust
The critics dissed us, the crowd kept clapping

"Can't hold it back, I-"

Fell in love with life pourin liquor for my buddies
We the rulers of the night father time can't stop me
In the 80's I copy Joseph and D now it's the capitol P
Living life like no tomorrow with my OG pass
What's the task I'll take it on the breakbeats breaking

"Can't hold it back, I-"

Only a few have seen me sober loved ones and all
We do it off the wall 8 albums for the stunner like what my nig
The p is a big with no chance for parole
And when we hit the stage we bust out swole
We do it for the half man do it for the whole
Doin it for mike turner and chris portugal
We a brand my man and some cram to understand
From hanging out with chuck d to taking shrooms in Japan
We march to our own drum beat discreet street poet
Only give it to the one's who got our back ya'll know it
We never give it up unless its the funk or respect
Where its due this goin out to my west LA crew
Who smoke the boo and buggaloo with regards to p crew

In fame we don't lust the funk we do trust
The critics dissed us, but the crowd kept clapping

In fame we don't lust the funk we do trust
The labels dissed us, but the crowd kept clapping

In fame we don't lust the funk we do trust
The radio dissed us, but the crowd kept clapping

In fame we don't lust the funk we do trust
That label dissed us, but the crowd kept clapping

"Can't hold it back, I-"

Am forced to smile city lights twinkle in the setting sun
Sets across the square miles I turn from the window in a thoughtful pose
No shame in a little fame laying out my clothes
Gin from the mini bottle, pillows on the bed
I look around and try to lock this moment in my head
I'm feeling like you can't be stopped when you're near the top
A job from a hobby, now drinks in the lobby
We'll let the valet rally up the coups for the troops
Rolling windows down with the sound banging out the sunroof
It must be a dream I wake up in a cold sweat
Cause sampling cold sweat couldn't cut cold checks could it?
If so then meeting mike was like a lightning strike
Crashing down to earth loud sparks lighting up the night
There will never be another in the same place and time
I raise a toast to the fans online and in line
And at the shows and there before because it's sold out
But we dont hold out hold back or reroute
So tonight I'm opening a tab, it's on me
From a soft chair watch the stars twinkle on the sea
A menu for the eating moment's fleeting but its beautiful
Cause life is beautiful the people keep the music dutiful
