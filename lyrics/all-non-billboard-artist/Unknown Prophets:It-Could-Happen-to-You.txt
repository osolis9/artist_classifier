It-Could-Happen-to-You:Unknown Prophets
If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might
Even when everything's all left untold
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenceless
For your eyes only
I showed you my heart
For when you're lonely, forget who you are
I'm missing half of me, when we're apart
When you're lonely, for your eyes only
I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
I think it's hard
But even though I don't feel a thing
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenceless
For your eyes only I showed you my heart
For when you're lonely, forget who you are
I'm missing half of me, when we're apart
When you're lonely, for your eyes only
I can feel your heart inside of mine
I feel it,
I feel it I've been going out of my mind
I feel it,
I feel it I know that I'm just wasting time
And I hope you don't run from me
For your eyes only
I showed you my heart
For when you're lonely, forget who you are
I'm missing half of me, when we're apart
When you're lonely, for your eyes only
For your eyes only
I showed you my heart
When you're lonely, forget who you are
I'm missing half of me, when we're apart
When you're lonely, for your eyes only
For you eyes only
Your eyes only
