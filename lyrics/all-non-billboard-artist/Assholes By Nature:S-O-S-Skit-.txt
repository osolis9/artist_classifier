S-O-S-Skit-:Assholes By Nature
(Chorus - Z-Ro + Trae)
Please don't get out of line, I'll slap a nigga
Owe me money - better give me mine, I'll slap a nigga
And if you cross over that line, I'll slap a nigga
I'll slap a nigga, I'll slap a nigga, I'll slap a nigga, I'll slap a nigga
If you disrespectin my zone, I'll slap a nigga
If you right and I think you wrong, I'll slap a nigga
If a nigga speak out of his tone, I'll slap a nigga
I'll slap a nigga, I'll slap a nigga, I'll slap a nigga, I'll slap a nigga
We don't pop, lock, and drop it - we cock the Glock to pop it
Go ballistic on (?)niggas and have e'm screamin stop it
Ain't got no patience so it's not a good ideal to get on my nerves
I'll fuck around and clip yo ass, and keep bangin yo face up against the curb
Homie let me give you a suggestion, gon'and let me make it
You might as well tighten up ya jaw, and gon'and let me break it
Wipe down, wipe down - I'm bout to wrap ya jack johnson right now
And if a woman run up on me wreckless and go to runnin her mouth
I'm a rear back and try to knock the bitch lipstick off
All I'm simply tryna do is just get my cash
But if you own a pair of lips you can kiss my ass
Tony Maroni when I catch you bitch you know what it is
Better ask Sam if I'm righteous I been a gangsta for years
But fuck him too cause he can get it just like you
And that's a fact run up on you and knock ya shadow off track...
(Chorus - Z-Ro + Trae)
I still fuck with the hoodrats, and then pop models
Get crunk off a superman and slap yo ass with a bottle
Go on crank it up, I'll make ya dance
Lean back and slap the swagga out ya whole stance
I'm a asshole nigga we don't talk about it
We go inside ya mouth and have ya front teeth walkin out it
My attitude shot to shit it ain't no doubt about it
Get out my business 'fore I beat ya ass the fuck up out it
Tell the DJ give me a sec, I'll wire the whole place up
Connect with a open hand and try to wire ya whole face up
Lock and load on ya jaw and try to fire that ho's face up
Try to take out ya feelin, in everything from the waste up
I give a fuck if you don't like me
I got the whole hood tryna keep it gangsta like me
Now am I rollin? Yeah bitch I might be
Not on a pill but in my zone is where I might be
(Chorus - Z-Ro + Trae)
I'm in ya nieghborhood, I'm bendin down ya block
Why don't you and everybody on the cut, come close to the curb and stick ya face out
Ya'll ain't no men, ya'll some women and ya'll deserve a backhand
I wear one right hand at the club cause that's my favorite snap hand
You in the presence of a boss, I'm nothin less then a king
Slap you to sleep, turn around and slap yo ass straight out of ya dream
I graduated from Slap - A - Bitch University on the honor roll
Piss on the tree and mark my territory, now it's time to roll
Never been the one to run from drama, bitch I'm plexin instead
Slap you like I'm a slap a bitch, you ain't gon pay me my bread
You can call me Trae - Holiday I'm bout to put you to bed
With a couple of extra large hickies posted on top of ya head
Now everytime I come around - they say I'm comin to bang
I'm a swat yo ass to the left, like I was ready to swang
Ain't no use to givin it thought I'm a forever play it raw
Let me show you what these five fingers, said to the jaw
