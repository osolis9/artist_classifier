Hipster-Girls:Iamsu!
Postin pics on your blog, uh
Takin rips of that bong, uh
Bout to move to Los Angeles
‘Cause you sick of livin' at home, uh
Shop at Urban Outfitters
All your other clothes is straight vintage
Top flannels around yo waist
Wearin' boots and panties in the winter
Hit the club with all of yo club homies
‘Cause your real friends can't get in
You will never wait in no lines
You already text the promoter man, man
And he thirsty and he wants you
But you use him for his club
Just to get close with a nigga with a table
A baller, a rapper, or even sell drugs
‘Cause you just want the plug and you got that
‘Cause you just want the light and you got that
And maybe if you get a little closer they might really fuck with you
Let you a ride with the top back
You just want love and affection
What they do is on to the next one
‘Cause if you ain't down for the action
You gon get yo ass kicked outcha section
But guess what, nigga

So go girl, do yo thing
I hope everybody in here know your name

I said go girl, do yo thing
I hope everybody in here know your name

Caught up in a hype in the lime light
But tell me what's gon happen when the hype fade?
But I guess you ain't learned from yo mistakes

He was messin with a senior in the 9th grade
Aspirin' model or actress
To niggas with money

You magnet
Constantly climbin the ladder

You swear to stay far from the stagnant
Everybody love a girl with a few goals
You a stripper and a model playin 2 roles
You be payin for yo college

But you dancing
At the same time saving for a new home
Uh uh, like hella likes hella likes
Instagram, that's life, am I right?
Bring her right up in them pictures, never wrong
When you caption always quota from a song

Like some drake shit, or some A$AP, or some André 3 Stacks
You don't give a fuck about these girls' opinions
You don't push these bitches up for they feedback
You just stretchin for the life and you need that

Get a car

And a crib, where the sea at
Wanna drink, wanna smoke, Where the weed at?
Wanna champagne toast you can keep that
Believe that, baby
