[Al Skratch]
From the fiery pits of hell, it's the rap rebel
Ten years underground, sublevel with the devil
Brothers want to know, can Al get busy
Honies want to know, can Ill get busy
I'll tell you now with the bang boom pow
Don't sleep, on the deep type creep wit' me style
Get with this, as you chill with that
I do the zig-a-zig with my nig Big Ill the Mack in fact
I won't stop as I blow up the spot
Nobody move, nobody get shot
Anyway niggaz who disobey I spray
I'm doin it up the _Carlito's Way_
Hold up a sec, as I check for my papers
Honies catch the vapors leavin major flavors on my pager
Ill the Mack got my back, I got his
Real niggaz. know what time it is

Chorus: Al Skratch {continuing sing-song}

Where my homiez? (Creepin through the hood!)
Where my homiez? (Up to no good!) . Come around my way
Where my homiez? (Creepin through the hood!)
Where my homiez? (Up to no good!) .

Yeah, yeah, c'mon!

[Big Ill]
Well it's Big Ill, the babblin bum, don't try to come
and creep through my hood, I don't really think you should
Cause I could, and I would, BUST A CAP
To put my niggaz on the map, TO PUT MY NIGGAZ ON THE MAP
Freak slacks as I stagger pack a dagger ready to drag or
bag a punk in the alley, like an O.G. but not from Cali
Crooklyn, res-i-den-cy
he's-i-tant G, that's what you better be
Step to me, catch a buckshot, whattup blood claat?
It's Big Ill, with the uptown connection
Flexin in my section'll get you fucked up on the reg
Your body I'll deliver to the river you can beg
(for your homiez) for your homiez but they won't be around
Buck buck buck is the sound then you drown

Chorus

[Al] Yo bust the remix that we fixed
[Ill] You know it's mad lethal
[Al] Creep in the jeep
[Ill] Pump funk for the people
[Al] Evil keeps lurkin when I'm workin my style
[Ill] Whoever smoke weed need to stay for a while
[Al] Now I'm standin on the corner we about to get hyper
[Ill] Aiyyo pass the 40-dog in a circle like a cypher
[Al] Time to roll the dice, fo'-five-six, headcrack
[Ill] Headcrack, don't front on the dough, you get smacked!
[Al] Aiyyo Ill that's my man
[Ill] Aiyyo Al that's my nigga
[Al] The only thing I exercise
[I+A] IS THE FINGER FOR THE TRIGGER
[Ill] So fuck a vest
[Al] We don't aim for your chest!
[A+I] A LIL SOMETHIN FOR MY NIGGAZ ON THE EAST AND THE WEST!

[Al Skratch]
Where my homiez? (Where dey at? Where dey at?)
Where my homiez? (We over here G!)
Where my homiez? (Where dey at? Where dey at?)
Where my homiez? (We over here G!)
