Here-With-Me:Mo Thugs
No one to turn to, no one to hold
My body misses your presence, come take full control
Come touch my lips, and let me kiss your fingertips
I wanna feel you inside of me, come and explode

I reminisce, don't believe I'm feelin' like this
Boy, you got me going in circles
(Circles)
I'll be damned, 'cause I don't understand

How can you take a piece of my heart?
(My heart)
It may sound crazy, but it still amazes me
Took me from the very start
(Hey, now)

The way you hold me, mama never told me it can be all so good
I guess some things just wasn't meant to be
Be under, be understood

I want here with me
I need you here with me
I love you endlessly
Oh, baby, can't you see?

I grab telephone, but I won't call
Don't believe it ain't killin' me, takin' my all
I smell your scent even though you're not around
Without your love, somethin's steadily pullin' me down

I can't resist now, can't believe I feel like this
There I go again in those circles
(Circles)
We got along, I should'na did you wrong
It didn't have to be this way
(Have to be this way)

And if ya come back to me
I won't have [unverified] word to say
(Hey, now)
A hey, now, I'm in the mood for you and only you

I swear that my love is true
And if ya don't give me another chance
Then, honey, what will I do?

I want you here with me
I need you here with me
I love you endlessly
Oh, baby, can't you see?

Touch my lips all inside
Callin' the hips of obsession right to ecstasy
Oh, baby, I want you here with me
I'm ready, love me now, love me now, come and explode

Come and hold me as I sing this song
(Love, love, love)
Love me now
Oh, I'm trapped in the heat of ecstasy
Love me now, so lonely
Oh, I'm so ready
