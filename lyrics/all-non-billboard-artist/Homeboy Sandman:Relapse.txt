Relapse:Homeboy Sandman
We been two weeks over
Feel like I'm two weeks old, like I'm two weeks sober
The mission is to stop missing you
Congrats on two weeks soldier
I started off strong
Hadn't heard no love songs
I'm weather this storm
However
Hours were never this long
And all these chicks bear your resemblance
Uhm
You had to send that text though
Till then I had you on my mind, kept you out the rated X though
But then I let go
Lost a hold of myself
Holding myself allowed myself to recollect mo'
You know how that go
Plus meeting my max quota tryna act cold
I start to relax
That's when I relapsed

THE WAY THAT I FEEL WITHOUT YOU
PLUS HOW I ABOUT YOU
I'M DOOMED
DOOMED
DOOMED

THE WAY THAT I FEEL WITHOUT YOU
PLUS HOW I ABOUT YOU
I'M DOOMED
DOOMED
DOOMED

Out of sight is out out of mind
But your pics still in my phone, and I look at em from time to time
I really should delete em
I don't need em
I need freedom
I'll delete em later
You know my make and what I'm made of
I move in life tryna do what's right by the creator
So if something's wrong, I ain't scared of moving on
Know I'm moving on to something greater
But that don't make it easy
I ain't been with other breezies
I get into a groove with fortitude but then it leaves me
Been to the gym about a thousand times
That's how I keep my mind occupied
These things be taking time
Last week when you suggested when we meet and I said fine
That was to prove that I had detached
Then I relapsed
Damn

THE WAY THAT I FEEL WITHOUT YOU
PLUS HOW I ABOUT YOU
I'M DOOMED
DOOMED
DOOMED

THE WAY THAT I FEEL WITHOUT YOU
PLUS HOW I ABOUT YOU
I'M DOOMED
DOOMED
DOOMED

By the time I'm back to first base
Forgotten why we broke up in the first place
I've been sick and now I've finally got first aid
It always feels amazing on that first day
But then we get into the same arguments
An hour after deciding we gon give it another try
And already we ain't seeing eye to eye
Now we wound up
Reminded that we can't rewind
I guess we need some more space
We ain't ready to fly straight
But I'm tense and I need my escape
But if we tryna remain friends, these are high stakes
My mistake
This is turning out the same, so I'ma turn around and go the other way
But I'll be back
I'll relapse
Yeah

THE WAY THAT I FEEL WITHOUT YOU
PLUS HOW I ABOUT YOU
I'M DOOMED
DOOMED
DOOMED

THE WAY THAT I FEEL WITHOUT YOU
PLUS HOW I ABOUT YOU
I'M DOOMED
DOOMED
