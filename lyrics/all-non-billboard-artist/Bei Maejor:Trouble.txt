Trouble:Bei Maejor
I, I, I, I
I told you not to wear that dress
To the club tryin' to dance up on me
I told you not to push that thing on me
If you know I want it, I, I

It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)

It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)

Baby, I told you not to wear them heels
That make your legs look so sexy
I, I, I, I told you not to wear them heels
That say I'm ready, come get me, I, I

They gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
They gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
They gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)

Go up to my room
You've been such a, such a bad girl
Such a sexy naughty girl
You know what you doing, baby

Go up to my room girl
You've been such a, such a bad girl
Such a sexy naughty girl
(Ooh, ooh)

Yeah, invitations in the whirlwind
We both bad at it
Told myself no more hittin' nigga's girlfriends
That's my old bad habit

Here you go, 'round that
Already know what I'm staring at
I mean from top to bottom, your body is problem so
Somebody better take care of that

And who better than the nigga in a letter man
When your man ain't home, you can let him in
Late night Letterman, I ain't gon' tattle tale
Damn, your ass bad as hell

It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)

It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)

I told you not to stare at me like that
When I'm performing
I-I-I-I told you
That that's gon' make us 'til the early morning

It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)

It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Ooh, ooh)
