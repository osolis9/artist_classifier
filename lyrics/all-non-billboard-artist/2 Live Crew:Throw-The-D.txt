Throw-The-D:2 Live Crew
Listen up, y'all 'cause this is it
Forget that old dance an' throw that D

Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance

There's a brand new dance an' it's comin' yo' way
It was started in Miami by the Ghetto Deejays
Say, some call it nasty but that's not true
Just the only dance that you can do

'Cause you need a sexy body, make your partner come alive
If you can't do that, don't even try
So get yourself together an' learn it quick
Just get on the floor an' throw that D

Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance

Throw that D, throw that D
Throw that D, throw that D

When I went to Miami, couldn't believe my eyes
This female was throwin', wanted me to try
If you don't know how to do it, here's what you must do
Just listen up close, I'll explain to you

Just jump in the air
An' when you land, you wind like you just don't care
It's all in the hips, so go berserk
An' let that dick do the work

So while it's workin', you better start strokin'
To show your partner that you ain't jokin'
'Cause this ain't a dance from Mother Goose
Better freak yo' body an' turn it loose

'Cause when you're on the floor you don't give a shit
All you wanna do is throw that D

Throw that D, throw that D

Party people, party people
Party people, party people, party people
Just feel it, just feel it
Just feel it, just feel it
