This ones for y'all if y'all want it
This one for la raza, bitch it don't stop
Til 4, 5, 6 in the mornin'
Till somebody's uncle sings 'till he drops
Now I rap for y'all and y'all know it
But goddamn, do I got that hatin' shit
Maybe ‘cause I'm Mexican n I be wreckin'
She steppin' and definitely bringin' em a little change to this
Man, I come from where they run from
‘Cause this ain't a sap and the pesos don't last us shit
A conundrum, I've been dumb some
Man, I'm proud of my people who we tryna get to call of slim
‘Cause I know y'all tired of bein pacifist
I'm running up with hella cats and I'm blasting shit
Till we back, we get attack and attack you bitch
‘Cause if you tryna fuck with us then you a masochist
Mira cabron, conmigo no te metas guey
Yo te voy a enseñar que conmigo no es okay
Poneme algun commentario que el ritmo es gay
Que no mato la liga con mi mixtape
There's always some dumb bitch with some shit to say
But a latina finna get up in here an hit the game
So you can hate, you can say shit but we gon' stay
Snow White tell them hating bitches fix your face

We rolling up, holding drinks
Let them haters hate
They know what's up, know we in here
They know we don't play, don't play
Don't play, don't play, don't play
Hold up, wait a minute, make them scream 'n shake
We showing up, blowing up
Tell my DJ hit play, hit play
Hit play, hit play, hit play

This one for the kickbacks in apartments
Man, fuck the neighbors and fuck the cops
If they don't want none, don't talk shit
From the VIP in the club to the parking lot
I got a whole belligerence, as in orthodox
And it all went downhill when we poured them shots
We poured one, four, six, twenty, fuck
I can't even afford it all
Around here these bouncers don't play
Been drinking monster all day
Girl, big as Ricky Rose
But I'm five foot three on a good day
Ok, I'm feeling Patron ay pero dice mi novia to phone home
But my girl here telling me don't go
Get ruled in the back, bon bo-bo-bo-bon bon

Like where my fellas in here getting stacks? Throw em
Where my women in here with the racks? Show 'em
What you doing in the back? Where you going?
Haters talking, stepping, its a rap, hold up

We rolling up, holding drinks
Let them haters hate
They know what's up, know we in here
They know we don't play, don't play
Don't play, don't play, don't play
Hold up, wait a minute, make them scream 'n shake
We showing up, blowing up
Tell my DJ hit play, hit play
Hit play, hit play, hit play

Where my fellas in here getting stacks? Throw em
Where the women in here with the racks? Show ‘em
What you doing in the back? Where you going?
Haters talking, stepping, its a rap, hold up

We rolling up, holding drinks
Let them haters hate
They know what's up, know we in here
They know we don't play, don't play
Don't play, don"t play, don't play
Hold up, wait a minute, make them scream n shake
We showing up, blowing up
Tell my DJ hit play, hit play
Hit play, hit play, hit play
