First let's just get this sraight you are just a man
But this just may be something you need to understand
It's a different day but you may just come in hand
'Cause I may need you
To get down on the floor do exactly what I say
If you catch me in my zone it may be your lucky day
But don't get out of control 'cause I may loose my patience with you
Can somebody please tell me why do men try to be something they could never be
'Cause us woman our totally different pedigree
You won't believe how I can be
But you may see

Mama always told me not to need a man
But one thing I should now is that I have the upper hand
And if do indulge in showing him my plans
The one thing he should know is I can also were the pants
With my f*cking heels on
Looking like a real strong woman
Any daddy would be proud to say I'm his
You just stepped into the kill zone
I just keep it real
Have you calling me your daddy I just tell it like it is
And I find it funny 'cause
Men try to be something they could never be
'Cause us woman are a totally different pedigree
You won't believe how I can be but you may see

'cause you could be my muse

You could be my muse
You could be my muse

'cause you could be my muse
