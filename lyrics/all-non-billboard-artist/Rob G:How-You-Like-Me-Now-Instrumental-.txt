How-You-Like-Me-Now-Instrumental-:Rob G
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me

How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me

Now tell me how you like me now, 'cause I'm real
You see, I was that before I got a deal
(Before the deal)
Now this is Rob G, I don't lie to chill
(Never that)
Now let me tell the world exactly how I feel
(Let's go)

You see, I'm thinkin' that it's 'bout the time
I been gettin' down for mine
Makin' sure the south is mine, thinkin' that you out your mind
All I do is speak the truth, every time I hit the booth
Look around and see the proof, reach the hood, I'll reach for you

Damn right, a real muh'fucker, go 'head and glance twice
I don't rap about my dreams, I rap about my damn life
Stackin' my paper, want me to rap 'bout my paper
My credit sucks, my bills are bad but I'll just pay it off later

I ain't broke, though, you know I got that hood money
But Uncle Sam just be knowin' about that good money
So when I tell you I can get the 'ye, I don't be sayin' it
'Cause this rhymin' with some shit I say, I just sold a brick today

How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me

How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me

R.I.P. the hoe, so I swang a popo grill
Made it out the hood, but I'm in the hood
Leather so soft, yeah, I like the way it feel
Hoppin' out fresh, like I signed a million dollar deal

Yeah, I'm the truth, '84, sittin' on the truck
Haters on my nuts, while I'm ridin' with a Cuban slut
Or I can do the drop, trunk up fifth-eighth
Doors hoppin' fly, while I'm sittin' on some sick paint

Customize, I'm Johnny, your shit H
Nose in the air, actin' like my shit don't stank
I'm the king of the streets, so I'm top rank
[Unverified] from the whips and I can roll where ya block can't

I walk nice, and my whips, they shoot up
Beatin' so hard, it'll make you throw your food up
A.B.S. still red, black and blue'ed up
And we don't wanna hear it if it never been smold with blood

How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me

How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me

Now you can tell, I'm real by the way I be walkin'
Real by the way I be actin', real by the way I be talkin'
Real by the way I be rappin'
Man, I feel throbbin' like a chandelier
Thought that I would blow it like a Cavalier

Now you keep a camera near
'Cause you know you in the pretense of a star
I'm still hood, love to keep my weapon in my drawer
The rapper's rapper, took a path that's faster

Where respect come first, and the cash is after
From Coasta Lia, got 'em shook, I'm here
Damn near became a legend in my city in a year
So you like actin' like you don't know who I

It's Rob G, the hottest four letters since July, yep
It's the new guy, higher than the blue sky
Lot of dudes rappin', and I do not have a clue why
XXL said, "We dead", no sucka
Go back and see the issue that got Wayne on the cover
Tell me

How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me

How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
How you like me now, 'cause I'm real
How you like me
