You-Could-Be-Live-Version:Seven
what shall i say when i go down for you?
down on my knees for you, down on my knees for you
not even a million speeches can describe what i feel
what i really feel for you, what i feel for you
in your arms i've learnt, in your ams i've learnt to let go love
you gave my life a change, you helped me to rearrange
now i ask the question of eternity

you could be mine forever, say yes

it ain't just a wish to spend my life with you
it's a nightmare to be without,
please god, don't ever let me be without
you are the sun around my world,
does turn my soul and my heart does turn
please girl forever burn, i pray for your love, never stop to burn
nobody will ever carry me, nobody will ever carry you
the way that you and me do, the way that you and me do
now i ask the question of eternity

you could be mine
