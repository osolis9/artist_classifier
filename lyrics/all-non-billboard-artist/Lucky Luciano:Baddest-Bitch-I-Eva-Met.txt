Baddest-Bitch-I-Eva-Met:Lucky Luciano
She was pretty in the face,
She was fat on the back,
She was thin in the waist,
Baddest bitch I ever met,

Gave me her number,
So I had to call her,
A couple days later
I was at the damn doctor

I swear to god
She was bad,
Had a trunk full of ass,
Met her at the club
Should of seen the way she dance
Yeah her name was lydia
Ain't never seen nothing prettier
Wanted her in my video,
Whatz your number?
Called her one the under
Picked her up for lunch,
I know it sounds dumb but
I forgot the condoms,
We ate, got drunk, took her
Home and fucked,
Warm, wet cuchi man
I beat that up,
All night affair I was
Feeling like a playa,
Woke up on the morning hit
It one more gan
Send her on her way
Thought I call her in a day,
Ain't these a bitch now
I'm pissin raisin blades

She was pretty in the face,
She was fat on the back,
She was thin in the waist,
Baddest bitch I ever met,

Gave me her number,
So I had to call her,
A couple days later
I was at the damn doctor

You think I learned after that
But my head too hard,
Doctor gave me a prescription
To fixed my problem,
Forgot about the flames
Coming out my dick,
Should of thought about it though
When I met my next bitch,
Named lucy (lucy)
Said she wanna do me,
Girl was fine enough to start
In her own movie,
Throwed yellow bone better than beyonce,
Should of knew better met her ass on myspace,
Pulled up to her house and she opened
Up the door,
Wearing nothing but a robe,
She was taking off my clothes
Man I could'nthelp it it was on I had to stick her,
A couple days later my dick had a pimple

She was pretty in the face,
She was fat on the back,
She was thin in the waist,
Baddest bitch I ever met,

Gave me her number,
So I had to call her,
A couple days later
I was at the damn doctor.

This a public service annoucement
Don't swim without it,
Keep a life jacket inside your wallet,
Listen to my song before somethin goes wrong,
I know she looks good wearing nothing but a thong,
Better wrap it up, before you outta luck
Gonna be mad as fuck when that bump show up,
At the doctor's office tryna explain your problem
Ain't this shit funny but it ain't no lie,
And I'm a keep it real, sho I've been there before,
Used to go without a trashbag but not no more, (nope)
Strap my gun up before I let it bust,
Can't kill myself I love fucking too much .
