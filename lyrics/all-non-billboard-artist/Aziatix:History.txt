History:Aziatix
So many things that I want, do I let them go?
I work so hard for this music, and if it's too much to ask then let me know
Cuz' I want this so bad I can't sleep, no
Keep this up how the hell am I gonna eat? No
Cuz' I'm grown as a man
In the lab like 24, 7 days a week bam

See if they can all do it, why can't I?
God taking my life is the only way that I can't try
Plus I know that I'm different from all mankind
And I ain't work this hard for years to waste all that time
Words of Martin Luther "Everybody has a dream"
And anything is possible cuz' faith is in between
Yet I feel I want to flee to a place where I can blow with the breeze
Flow with the streams

Is it wrong of me to get what I want?
Cuz' I know I'm giving all of me
What's left of me is gone
So before I make my way, pack my bags and leave this place,
One last song before I lay, hey

This is history in the making
This is history in the making 
This is history in the making
This is history in the making

I got my mom on the phone and I'm stalling
Destiny's on the other line
That's my calling
If I can't walk then I'll be crawling
Cuz' faith is my strength for this weak, impaired player, wheelchair ballin'
So I can't stop,
I've been through harsh winters with ripped in half socks, shorts, tank-tops
Cruising through hell
I know the flow's passed hot
Fiend for a loud buzz cuz' this is my last shot

So before I make my way,
Pack my bags and leave this place,
One last song before I lay, hey

This is history in the making
This is history in the making 
This is history in the making
This is history in the making

Gave everything I have for one chance to blow
More than half my life and there's nothing else for me to show

Losing is not an option
And success is my thesis, I'm not swaying off the topic
The man that controls the cockpit all the way I'ma take it
I was never mistaken

This is history in the making
This is history in the making 
This is history in the making
This is history in the making
This is history in the making, can I take it all the way?
This is history in the making
This is history in the making 
This is history in the making
This is history in the making

So many things that I want, do I let them go?
I work so hard for this music, and if it's too much to ask then let me know
