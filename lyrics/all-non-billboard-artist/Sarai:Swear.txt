Swear:Sarai
How many dimes you done dropped the same lines to
Played games and lied to got inside ooh
Don't even want to think about it
Somebody tried to tell me all them games you played around wit'
You tellin the truth doubt it
Did you ever really keep it real when it counted
I release myself and roll out
Said ya'd never lie but ya sold out
Before ya know it I'm gone
With short notice 'cause I played them games way too long
I'm movin on movin up movin out
Sit and think about why you losin out
Missed ya chance to experience real romance
Now I'm workin the club while you save the last dance
Standin there wit' ya hand out
Had me fooled for a minute but time just ran out

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
OK I believe you

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
OK I believe you

Yeah OK I believe you better get it through your thick head
That I don't need you
Phone calls wit' the hang-up
Or it's ya boys wit' an invite to a chick's house you could go gang up
Tag team hittin girls from rag team
The rat heads boost ya ego to a fat head
Comin wit' lies I don't deserve saw you as the center of my earth
I see you know just dirt
What's it worth for me to stick around and see you lie
Right to my face and it's supposed to be alright
Well it's not and I've had enough
Hit the whammy dog should've stopped pressin your luck
I used be like what's up baby now I'm like what
Used to drive me crazy now I'm just nuts
Used to wanna hear you talk now I'm like shut up
Used to care now I don't give a fuck

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
OK I believe you

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
OK I believe you

I would never lie to you-Stop
Never lie to you-Please
Never lie to you-OK-never never never

So I'm the only one right
Well who keep pagin you at like 2 every night
Claim I'm the love of your life well how it go
Out of mind when you out of sight so
When I step away it's like the wifey get away
You start spittin game askin for the number and name of every dame
That walk by so I dead it see the chalk line
Hop on hers you off mine now if ya don't mind
I got somewhere to be
That'd be anywhere that you're not next to me
I have no desire to waste my time on liars
Kill all the noise like a hitman for hire
You had it let it go now ya want this
Gotta break out leave ya heart broke like ya promise
I could've forgiven you everyone makes mistakes
But I only deal wit real and you fake

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
OK I believe you

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
OK I believe you

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
OK I believe you

Ayyo I swear to you Sarai what up I would never dare lie
OK I believe you
Swear to you Sarai you the only girl in my life
