Vamos!
Uno, dos, tres, quatro...
Come on! Vamos!

Get on down, it's summertime
It's have some fun and everything's all right
From midnight to noon: the Spirit of Ibiza
Livin' on and let it show
Is in the air wherever you invoke
A midnight noon: the Spirit of Ibiza

Come on!
Shake me Shake me Wait me Make me
Loosin' my mind try me and create me
Down on sun and turn yours
I said: "Push you hot just let it go!"
You can see the creep goin' on goin' down
On the dancefloor hear the sound
I'm feelin' good. I'm feelin' fine.
I feel this rave on the summertime.
Mystic is here to make you move
Come on get down to the Mystic's groove
Tonight tonight everythin's all right
Chick to chick I hold you side
Get it down. Get it down. Get it down. Get it down.
We never gonna stop. Goin' on strong.
I think in the peace. Peace I've started.
Here is the party! Move your body!
