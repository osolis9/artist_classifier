Volt:Yung Lean
Heart, heart, heart of a lion, lion
Heart departed from my soul, thanks to everyone who hates me, only makes me fit my role
I got orange juice and doobies, I'll be tourin troops, and groupies
Chef fired, vampire, diamonds, diamonds, i got rupees, i got pills in my smoothies
SBE, Just some loonies
Move like gang hit the scene with my trueies
Money, money in my bank account
You know I've gotta spend it all
Flick the lighter's light
If I die you'll never see me fall
Fuck the police, til the, til the, til the curtain call
Ball? No, basketball, New shoes, bank calls
Mix it with some alcohol, Adderalls, 'till I fall
Not supposed to make it so we chase it till we got em all
Made it, did it, out of zero[?], flipped it, got it, made a hero
Fuck the game, I've been a year old[?], faster than you like De Niro
If you don't like me, get the fuck out my face
I'm ridin' in a starship, get the fuck out my way
