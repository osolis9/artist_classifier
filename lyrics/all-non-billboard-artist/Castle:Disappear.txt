Disappear:Castle
I thought I knew what love was then but that was in another time,
Because I was so young my friend, I didn't understand what it was like.
But now I look into your eyes, and it's true this time, I feel it deep inside,
You're part of me, I'm part of you, that's why I know it's true, no need to hide our true selves!

Yeah we piss each other off at times, but when it rains outside, we can make love till it's all dried up now
It's a long way down to jump from here, now that I know it's clear, we can just... disappear.

Some time has passed I'm older now, and I've seen how true love should be
Some things in life you only learn with time you burn doing good deeds
I used to think I lost my mind, I'd never met your kind before
But now I long for no one else, for you I melt, I'll never need one thing more!

Yeah we piss each other off at times, but when it rains outside, we can make love till it's all dried up now
It's a long way down to jump from here, now that I know it's clear, we can just... disappear.

It is truly amazing what love can do to your decision making
so you can bet that I will risk it all to be with her
I don't care who knows or how hard I will fall.

Yeah we piss each other off at times, but when it rains outside, we can make love till it's all dried up now
It's a long way down to jump from here, now that I know it's clear, we can just... disappear.
