Gray skies all around
There's no light in sight
The one that left behind
Haunted by the night

Devilish as I fall
I fall for all the time
Haunted
Haunted by the night

Take one breath
It's not the end
It's not the end
I heard you say
One more day
It's not the end
It's not the end
I heard you say

Take one breath
It's not the end
It's not the end
I heard you say
One more day
It's not the end
It's not the end
I heard you say
