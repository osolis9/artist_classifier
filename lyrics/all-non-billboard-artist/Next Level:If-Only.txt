If-Only:Next Level
(feat. Yazzy)

Verse 1 - Mackin

Woke up looked at my phone no BB
I was like what the fuck is this the real me?
She says I love you I'm like I disagree
Cause you say it to everyone silly
It's hard cause I'm in L O V E
You're a heart breaker I guarantee
Have to take you out on a shopping spree
Buy you a zinger from kfc
Blockbusters buy a DVD
Has to be a blu ray or in 3D
Come back to mine if I find my house key
She's like wow I'm loving the TV
I said YOLO she's like exactly
I love my friends fans and my family
I'm a rapper singer not a MC
Take this to the next level if only

Hook - Anna

I dunno how you're feeling
I don't know what you want
But all I know right now is that it's you I really want
If Only you just felt the same
We still could have this fame
Baby please just try with me and end this stupid game

Verse 2 - Compound

I told you I loved you and you pulled it back
I'm on a road to your heart but I lost track
We've been good friends for so long now
When he cheated on you and broke that vow
I was the one who gave you the shoulder
But in front of me lays the fucking big boulder
What's the point in waiting when we're getting older
When I get close I'm told Dan no
Please give me a sign cause I keep seeing no
Just Point to the way and I'll make the walk
Just not away from you please baby let me talk
Cause one thing I can't do is fucking walk
When you run back to him it kills me inside
But when I'm with you I smile on the outside
My heart is dying
Friends or not, I'll always love you
uh
yeah

Hook - Anna

I dunno how you're feeling
I don't know what you want
But all I know right now is that it's you I really want
If Only you just felt the same
We still could have this fame
Baby please just try with me and end this stupid game

Verse 3 - Yazzy

Remember that time we were together
Thought we would last forever 
But guess things always change like the seasons and the weather
Loved you girl so much but now it's fucking killing me 
Living life without you is fucking hard and trust me
I mean have you ever loved someone so much they don't feel the same?
Fuck, why is it bad luck or is just fate?
Lifes hard with your loved one turning away from you
Makes me ask myself God what the fuck did I do to deserve this 
I'm just living my life the way I want and not the way I know should
Ain't always behaved the best way 
Never treated people the way I could
And I'm sorry but please forgive me for my bad ways
Help me be the best that I can be and help me to always believe,
In myself in what I do and what I say and all the other ways 
I've let people down father please forgive me for my bad ways and please just put on smile on my fucking face
