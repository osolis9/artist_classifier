Subirse-El-Muerto:The Warriors
[FEATURING ANDREW DI JORIO/STRAY FROM THE PATH/VOCALS]

 FOREVER SURROUNDING MY MIND AND MY DREAMS, IT'S SO CRAZY TO THINK WHAT I FEEL AND I SEE. I SEE IT'S LIKE A SLEEPING DISEASE... A SLEEPING DISEASE IN MY REM DEEP SLEEP. SUBIRSE EL MUERTO... HIDE FROM THE LIGHT CUZ I CANNOT PROTECT YOU... SUBIRSE EL MUERTO... I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE NOW I'M LEAVING IT AGAIN. THIS PLACE IS SO FAMILIAR, WHERE DO I BEGIN. TO THE CITY OF PAIN THROUGH THE DARKNESS WHERE YOUR SOUL WILL REMAIN. ABANDON ALL HOPE AND ENTER INSANE. WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE SUFFERING IN MY NAME? CAN'T MOVE, ENTIRE BODY IS NUMB. ABANDON ALL HOPE. GRABBING ME BUT I CAN'T RUN, MOVE OR FIGHT. ABANDON ALL HOPE. CAN'T MOVE, ENTIRE BODY IS NUMB. ABANDON ALL HOPE. WHAT DO THEY WANT? WHAT DO THEY WANT FROM ME? - WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE SUFFERING IN MY NAME? THE PALENESS AND FEAR IN THEIR CHEEKS AND THEIR BRAINS. TURN YOUR HEAD, SHUT YOUR EYES FOR A WHILE AND SEE, YOU COULDN'T FIND A PLACE THIS WILD... ARE YOU LISTENING? SUBIRSE EL MUERTO, HIDE FROM THE LIGHT CUZ I CAN NOT PROTECT YOU. WIDE AWAKE BUT MY WHOLE ENTIRE BODY IS NUMB.
