The-Other-Side:Deacon the Villain & Sheisty Khrist
I'm bout to jump up out the plane with no parachute
I told my wife no time for breakfast, girl, cause I got the juice
I'm steppin' right up out this bitch no time for lacing my shoes
I said "I'm bout to take a flight past the moon"
This boy can fly if you don't know
I can move too quick for the photos
Spread my wings
Fly where they can't go
Bout to free myself from the pharaoh
In sky like
The moon during twilight
I'm feeling really high right?
But in hindsight
Everything that I write
Is from the other side
I'm a bird that's fresh out the cage
Can't telescope me
I'm out of range
Intergalactic
I'm outer-space
Dead to the world
But climbed out the grave
Dealing with feelings of living afraid
Will place you a ceiling where you can't escape
We are all made in the image of one without limits
So everyone put on your capes

I wanna tell you something 'bout the people you know
Ask 'em what are they living for
You got to know everything that glitters ain't gold
I hope you are enjoying the show
Well c'mon

Baby I'm not gon' live another night
Unless I spread my wings and take flight
To the other side

Sometimes I don't see sunlight
Sometimes I don't see sleep
Sometimes it mess with my love life
Sometimes a nigga don't eat
Most times things don't go right
Gotta detour that dream
Whole up'!
"Fuck that shit get back to the script like you're illustrated by Stan Lee!"
If you're passionate tell the universe nothing rattles your dream
You're the master so break the shackles cause people got to be free
Although some may laugh at it
It's no accident
You can walk on the sea
Even build a pyramid or another wonder for people to see
In a life heavy as the ocean
It can drown your emotion dealing with the motion
I'm tellin you that you are really chosen
I'm hoping you are really open to dealing with the notion
Row that boat in the lowest of tide
Get a surfboard when the waves get high
You got gifts that'll help you rise
Spread yo wings
Touch that sky
