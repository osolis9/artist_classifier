La-Da-Di-Dum:Tahir
You've got the looks
And I've got the hooks
Somebody anybody get me out of this fix
Before I make another move like Taylor Hicks
Your move has got a certain groove
Girl you drop it off like
Another bomb on Hiro
Makes me want to be another superhero

It makes me want to make you mine
And I'm down to one last pick up line
Coz it even makes a blind man whine fine
Oh yeahh...

Yeah...
Girl you got my circuits doing overtime
Just to work out this chemistry (come and get it honey)
I ain't gonna make another day without a potion
Of this loving spree
You're certified fine
And you got to be mine
Coz I got a certain funky line (let me tell you this)
Keep your mother
Make me love her
Ain't no other will do
La di da di dum
I ain't over till you're over
La da di dum di da di doo

Yeah!
I'm on the news
But I'm breaking loose (yes I am)
Cut me bleed me
Hang me spank me
I'm still breathing of your love
And it makes me want to make you mine
And I'm down to one last pick up line
It even makes a blind man whine fine
Oh yeahhh...

Girl you got my circuits doing overtime

Make me love her

La da di dum di da di doo

La da di dum la da di doo
You got me on tounge and cheek
La da di dum dum la da di doo
I'm majoring a minor blow
Keep your mother
Make me love her
Ain't no other will do
And I ain't over till you're over
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

I ain't gonna make another day without a potion
Of this loving spree
You're certified fine
And you got to be mine
