Radioactive-Baggi-Begovic-Remix:Rita Ora
Palms to the sky
We unite
I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight

I'm checking you out in your sweet desire
I'm coming over to make you mine
It's a crime boy, you're so fine
I'm taking you out, boy, it's a green light
I'm glad you came over, it was about time
It feels right, boy you're so fine

This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat

Palms to the sky
You know, I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite, I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight

Moving on me as the world ends
This nuclear heat is a beautiful air
You might not live to tell

This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat
This goes radioactive
Drop the ball, let me feel the beat

Palms to the sky
You know, I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite, I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight

Palms to the sky
You and I
Palms to the sky
You and I
Palms to the sky
You and I
We rise tonight

Palms to the sky
You know, I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight
Palms to the sky
We unite, I feel it, I feel it, feel feel it
We rise tonight

We unite, you and I are right tonight
We unite, you and I are right tonight
We unite, you and I are right tonight
You and I are right tonight
