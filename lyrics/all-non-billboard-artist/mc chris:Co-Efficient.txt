Co-Efficient:mc chris
I wanna talk about math, math
I love math, gettin' my books for school
Wait a minute, math, math?
Hey, what the fuck are you doing over there you geek?

Oh, don't hit me
Just jabbering about math?
What is this math books? There they go
Ooh, you knocked the books out of my hands

I gotta pick them up now
I gotta, you, I, I gotta get to class
Hey, you like math do ya?
Yeah, I like math

I got a practical math application for ya
Your a-face plus my fist plus
A something I'm gonna shove up
Your asshole divided by pie, the co-efficient

Ah, ah, oh, ah, you're hurting me
Oh, this is so painful

Shut up, if you think this is painful
Meet me in the boys bathroom at two o'clock
And then I'll show you painful
I'll show you painful you fuckin' kid
One day, I'm gonna show him
