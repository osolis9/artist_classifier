Cant-Live-Alone:Bilal
Now that you're gone why am I feeling so alone
Ringing your number but you're not picking up the phone
Gave you my heart and I gave my soul
I guess sometimes you gotta live and let go
I just wanna put things right, done with the lying
I'm begging on my knees
I wanna smile in your face, don't wanna see you cryin'
Cause you're the one for me
Don't think I'm letting go, I need a setting stone
I won't stop ringing until you're picking up your telephone
I know you're out there somewhere, I just wanna bring you home
P.
s: I love you, i'm out, I'm feeling so alone.I'm so alone, pick up the phone
I just wanna hear you say hello
Want you to stay, make things the same
I can't live my life alone, can't live my life alone
I just can't live my life alone, no no no no, can't live my life alone.
Struggling without here, can't you see
Looking at old pictures of you and me
I know you've heard it all before, but it's a new me
Tossing and turning all night getting no sleep
I wish I could turn back time, take it back to the way it was
With all the smiles and laughter
Back in my arms like the end to a fairtytale
Happily ever after
Don't think I'm letting go, I need a setting stone
I won't stop ringing until you're picking up your telephone
I know you're out there somewhere, I just wanna bring you home
P.
s: I love you, i'm out, I'm feeling so alone.I'm so alone, pick up your phone
I just wanna hear you say hello
Want you to stay, make things the same
I can't live my life alone, can't live my life alone
I just can't live my life alone, no no no no, but I can't live my life alone.
You walked out of my life, I'm looking up at the time
Twelve thirty didn't think I'd be writing these rhymes
I should have seen the signs
You said you put you beside, these lies, you know it's right
Got back from work, I don't know why I felt something was wrong
Got through the door, walked up the stairs and found that all her stuff was gone
You even left that ring I got you for your sixteen
You left without a reason, baby how could this be
Livin' alone, without you, it just don't feel like home.I'm so alone, pick up your
phone
I just wanna hear you say hello
Want you to stay, make things the same
I can't live my life alone, can't live my life alone
I just can't live my life alone, no no no no, but I can't live my life alone.
Can't live my life alone.
