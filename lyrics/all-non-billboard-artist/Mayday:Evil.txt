Evil:Mayday
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Evil

I can't believe my eyes
I've seen an angel in disguise
Called evil
She haunts me in my sleep
I search for ways
To shake the serpents
I'm a slave to evil
This girl won't let me be

I woke around 7: 40 or so
With an eye on the rising sun
Sunshine never made me blind
A girl has never made me bite my tongue
Despite the drum and my vice with funds
I felt like I was the nicest one
But you fried my lungs
Broke my pride for fun
You tryna slice a fella into crumbs

Da-da-dum

6 months ago, I'm fine I know
That the memories just won't fade
I'm tryna stand back up on my feet
You sweep 'em down every other day
I told my friends you were evil at heart
Sabotage is your middle name
I shoulda known when you said on the phone
You play pain like it's just a game
You evil thang

Evil
Haunts me in my sleep
Too evil
