Good-Day:Greg Street
It's Nappy hour, ayo Street, Country Boyz is back
It's 6 O' clock, it's time to have a good day

I got up this mornin' and I said I'ma do somethin'
For the united streets of America
So I got Nappy Roots in here, I got Big Al 36 in here
This is Greg Street certified and today
Yeah, you're gonna see another street boy playin' piano

We're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

Hey, we're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that trouble for another day
Hey, we're gonna have a good day

Hairline fresh, new cologne on
Feelin' so good, change the color to my phone
Orange Kool-Aid go good with Patron
Oh no, hell no, boy is still my ring tone

Free car wash, had to clean up my Dodge
Give back when I can just playin' my part
Church folks had a fish fry mustard hot sauce
Light bread French fry, love for the big guy

Hit the park blowin', showin' off they hops
Nappy roots on the radio and you know it hot
Last night it hit the big three
Bought some air force one's four tall tee's
Man, I'm lovin' BG

We're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

Hey, we're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that trouble for another day
Hey, we're gonna have a good day

And I ain't really worried 'bout what nobody say
'Cause I'm still above ground and that's a reason to pray
Got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play
Make a call to the sticks say I'm headin' that way

Heard my cousin cookin' out got to get me a plate
Got this new outfit ain't even out in the states
So if I ain't speakin' to soon it's a hell of a day
And this stinky got me sittin' in a hell of a play

Got my stunna shades on and a grin on my face
New grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
And the hood showin' love so I'm a okay

We're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

Hey, we're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that trouble for another day
Hey, we're gonna have a good day

Yo, we might as well do exactly what the children say
Take the day off, hit the park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few and put up the deuce
And if it's beef put the peace down and throw up the dukes

It's time to change our ways so we can say today
For the children sake and make a better place to play
If it's all good, you got your group and grip your wood
And if you're ridin' dirty just light the flip and blow ya

But do it real big exactly like a playa should
Enjoy your 24, do ya thing and rep ya hood
The world is all yours, but still we all grind forever
And a day the choice you make is really all fine

We're gonna have, we're gonna have
We're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

Hey, we're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that trouble for another day

Hey, we're gonna have a good day
And all my homies gonna ride today
And all these mommies look fly today
And all we wanna do is get by today

Hey, we're gonna have a good day
And ain't nobody gotta cry today
'Cause ain't nobody gonna die today
You can save that trouble for another day
Hey, we're gonna have a good day
