So-Lit:Redfoo
Hands Up,
I'm losing my grip cuz you so beautiful,
You stand up,
In the back seat hair blowing in the wind.

Ain't never seen,
It's you and me,
Sucking and fucking each other,
The birds and the bees,
You know you hot,
But you ain't got,

Cuz girl you make me so fucking hot I wanna burn up,
The way you make it pop,
At the spot,
When we turn up,
It's beautiful, (Beautiful!)

Cuz youuuuuuuuuuu
Got me So Lit!
Come and take me high, baby!
