Montreux-Album-Version-Edited-:Curren$y
Yea, and this is what I do
Yea, lames catch feelings we catch flights
? seen him till you seen him, jet life
Yea lames catch feelings we catch flights
.you aint' seen him till ya'? yea, fool
You aint' never seen the man until you seen the man

Uh, kush smoke
Money clothes hoes
Hurry up before that elevator door close
This that 1980 Marvin Gaye live at the Montreux
Stars in the audience
Al Jarreau in the third row
Parent guardian to this art for its my baby
Lazy eye though watchful
Try to play me I spot you
Points I prove with my every move
Right from the beginning
I was right and that was very true
This is what I knew
Make a fool out of you if we were to duel
In a hall playa playin' pool
Renegade bitches choose
Word to Max Jeux
Drop jewels
Diamonds different hues

Type of shit I like to do
Orange leather in my coupe
Carrot soup
My women ball word to Sheryl Swoops
Minus the hoop she fell through
Fell in love with the blue dreamin'
Of things she can't have
Now she's looking down like she's tryin' to use her ipad
Pro tools confiscated as evidence by the crime lab
But I aint' even have to do it like that
Knife work on the track
Many will cut and slash
At the neck like a sash
Blood on my hands
Me and my killer band
Raw shit killa-gram
Eyes spinning ceiling fan
You aint' never seen the man until you seen the man
Raw shit killa-gram
High spinning ceiling fan
You aint' seen the man until you seen the man
Fool
Yea
