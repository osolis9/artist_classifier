Sweet-Romance:Cesar Comanche
This ain't no love song
This ain't no love song
This ain't no love song
This ain't no love song	

When I was too young t know the story
When you say you love me
It don't matter
Sooner it will take some strips to haunt me
You see?
Come on, what you feel now?
You think it's real?
Too late to put the cat back
Conscience gone flat, say it once and a again
Still rolling to discount the fact
That love wasn't apart you
Moments ain't rarely enough for you to compare to

But you're shaggin' up anyway
Every live will play in its nice 4 time
We don't have no ball lane with no wife
This feeling is proved to stay

This ain't no love song
This ain't no love song
Come on!
When I was too young t know the story
This ain't no love song
This ain't no love song
Come on!
When I was too young t know the story

When I was too young t know the story
When you say you love me
It don't matter
Sooner it will take some strips to haunt me
You see?
Have some kids, go fill it,it works
Soon those kids will be used to hurt
You didn't see it comin'
Hit the ground runnin'
When you know they will bring no sum of money
That you are scared to bet
Come on, cause you feel validated
Never saw the switch so it made just a perfect game
Even if now it's so complicated
If they wanna hang with you
They got to wait in line

This ain't no love song
This ain't no love song
Come on!
When I was too young t know the story
This ain't no love song
This ain't no love song
Come on!
When I was too young t know the story
