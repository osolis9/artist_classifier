The-Horn-Song:Living Legends
We're waiting every night
To finally roam and invite
Newcomers to play with us
For many years we've been all alone
We're forced to be still and play
The same songs we've known since that day
An imposter took our life away
Now we're stuck here to decay

Please let us get in!
Don't lock us away!
We're not like what're thinking

We're poor little souls
Who have all lost control
And we're forced to take that role
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987
Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck in defend
After all you only got

Five Nights At Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you wanna stay
Five nights at Freddy's?
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay
Five Nights at Freddy's?

We're really quite surprised
We get to see you another night
You should looked for another job
You should of said to this place goodbye
It's like there's so much more
Maybe you've been in this place before
We remember a face like yours
You seem acquainted with those doors

Please let us get in!
Don't lock us away!
We're not like what're thinking
We're poor little souls
Who have all lost control
And we're forced to take that role
We've been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987
Join us, be our friend
Or just be stuck in defend
After all you only got

Five Nights At Freddy's
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you wanna stay
Five nights at Freddy's?
Is this where you wanna be?
I just don't get it
Why do you want to stay
Five Nights at Freddy's?
