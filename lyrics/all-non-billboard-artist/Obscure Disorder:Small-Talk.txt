Small-Talk:Obscure Disorder
[Logik]
Make the quick decision, recognition or the limelight
Fuck all gimmicks I rather connect like websites
Visions took flight of all the money and the jiggy
But when it crashed back to Earth, the true worth was shown to me
Indepents circle means will find ways to work it
On the next EP, you see how Audio Researched it
Without big stars, but we keep it tight like constillations
Half-ass cats, more wigs split than segregation
But never the less, my thought process on progress
When the vinyl's pressed, got no time to ever second guess
Get the picture, we make moves like Bobby Fisher
All over the map, bumrushing cats like the militia
Coming back home, we're analyzed and scrutinized
Trying to make a name, cutting us off like we were circumsized
Peeps are respected in the words are reflected
Walking on the path they paved, never deflected
[Eclipse]
In these thought process, I'mma bless y'all with the real from the onset
Classify me as a prospect, I deserve all my props kid
In this collective, can't y'all see from no angles
And respective, found the road to success without directions
More succeess perhaps, y'all regress because y'all possess 6 shots per gat
Six, six sides of rap, you're sick man, collapse
Like neurotransmitters sharper than my rest synapse[?]
And ask yourself, how's that?
Word from the wise cat, you should have studied me better
My cranial beretta, mentally inclined to stack cheddar
Under, most circumstance, my foes are clean cutters
Bustin' b-boy stance, I vanquish to enhance this
Rap isht, Islam establish in my mob cause havoc
Yours are wrapped in plastic, and mine (aaaaah) is patented
Lyrically hazardous, in regards I won't get blaphemous
Sinking O.D., you must be a masocist
[CHORUS]
"Keep on walking, keep on talking
Running through this brand new world"
"Keep on walking, keep on talking
Running through this brand new world"
[Kinetic Energy]
I make {niggaz} get a world of silent treatment, use kinesis
To throw away pieces
while you wait for Jesus I be the reason hell freezes
The wind is breezeless, and souls are ghost and trapped in avalanches
Changing standard, my anthem to fulfill the universe's answers
Intellects reject it with the methid, of what the hell's {niggaz} saying
Instead of rewinding,
they ingonre the fact that it was genius in the making
Those not ranking, I'm barely scraping from the plate that dodges my fork
??, inspired freezes, slap you stupid like a whore
Frustration grazes metamorph through phases, hit your flow out the door
Shut down more warmth than solar, energenic song but it's just the norm
I might be on, so I grimace pivot the valley of the thorns
Live by the book embedded in my chest and in my heart is sworn
[Science]
Medical prose cleverly written, virtuoso spitten
Samples of periodical flows is leaking like a kid is
Steadily awaiting for the entry of a third leg, release
In the beginning there is prophecies and revelations
Lyrically exposed signals the first time situation
The basic evaluation, it prepares us for the thousands we sold
Tow and a half in the cities and public housing
Let the truth be told, I must admit it surprising
But in God we trust, it gives us a push more like a bumrush
Regulating the speed while still holding the clutch
We never go Dutch, withhold no grudge
Doing shows when other motherfucker wouldn't even bother budge
See I cut you off, so call me John Deere when I get here
I used to think about maybe rising, now I'm crystal clear
Give me percentage of your cabbage and I'll take one share
While shifting the gear like speed while you're still in the rear
'Cause it's a must where we're living in this shadow of fear
And when the tires keep in switching to a Current Affair
I'm still on the air
[CHORUS]

"Keep on" (scratched by DJ A-Trak
