How-I-Could-Just-Kill-A-Man:Rage Against the Machine
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it

'Cause we're like outlaws striding, suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush when you see me driving by
Hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some putos

Acting kind of loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

I be doing all the dumb shit, yo
Because nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around I got ya humming
Humming coming at ya, then you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite shining a battle light
Swing out the gat and I know that we'll gat you right

Here's an example just a little sample
How could I just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home take my chrome
I said yo it's on, take cover son or you're assed out

How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out?
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway, young punk had to pay
So, I just killed a man

Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff ignite you with these sights and if you ain't down
Bullshit, say some punk tried to gat you for your auto

Would call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug, humming coming at ya
Yeah, you know I'm going to gat ya, how do you know where I'm at

When you haven't been where I've been, understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket or a fast ducket
Just to stay alive hey yo, I got to say fuck it

Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man

How I could just kill a man, how I could just kill a man
