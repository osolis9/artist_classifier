Down:Drapht
don't remember what to say, don't remember what to do
you don't remember where to go, don't remember what to choose, you will, you steal, you feel, you'll kneel 

DOWN DOWN DOWN down aint going to kneel on down ain going to kneel on down down NO
see the rain cloud followed me for years but would never let it bother me now when the lightning cracks i think i'll would never be where im at cause it had an impact growing up think back i was way to young then to know enough about the libraty that my mum had given me then the repper stole the soul with in of me, the first friend i ever knew of worst of him is we never grow up, cause then we went and moved our way to broom perth wasn't doing much not for the two of my parents, stairing the jerney in the eyewe drove 4 days and then 3 nights and just like that we started a knew life and just like that on a bus watch fights, maybe we would fight back till one of them stayed down this wasn't the right track if this is my play ground the day drowned out the used by just passed now just found my mum & dad need a turn now, 1 hour we just setteling in then we flying out never to see each other again could of sethered a limb with the pain, could of point the blame but i wil not kneel 

DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN i aint going to kneel on down aint going to kneel on down down down down i aint going to kneel on DOWN 

i was twelve nar actuly i think i was thirteen well darker then the day that i first seen, the hell mark in the arm of my friend couldn't tell but it felt like apart of me ended depended on crew to lead the way they sent the wrong message and lead us a stray i was able to see the fazz was fatel, some crave for the painful life and they pay full prise for direction, addiction, attraction every little restriction fell through the cracks in the pavement a slave to the under world wasn't one to tell them it was dumb as hell, and the summer melt them so they stay in the shad, instead of burnt playing with fire they got cut from playing with razzors, amazing how life changers, amazing how all the popular bullies became laymens, its a page in the chaper of the living got to put in practice when your rappings unforgiving but far the times the stars inline then you missed your chance but you can not kneel DOWN
