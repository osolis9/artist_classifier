Braids freshly twisted caressing a model
10 ton titan hey you looking exhausted
Jeans saggin' she asked? Where's your ass? I lost it

Mami you look right so let's twurk
On the dance floor all night and your blouse make it bounce

Clap your hands, clap your hands

After me there will be no replacement
Yo, what's that smell? My homie smoking in my basement
Marques went up to my room with a freak
He can use the bed just take off my sheets

Everybody left the club headed out to my castle
I had to kick a dude out for being an asshole
Cussin' at his broad drunk, loud, and staggerin'
'Cuz she was in my ear saying thing so flatterin'


But it didn't matter then how was that our friend
In my driveway gettin' her number at her Benz
Now I'm walking through my royal doors steppin' on my porcelain floor
Looking at broads who don't like to wear draws

Everybody got their hands up 'cuz I'm a bad boy
I throw live parties like Puff Daddy
Rome, true payer for real

Mama mama game so sick call the doctor
Ring, quick, quick, quick
The DJ's bumpin' up in da club
I got 2 freaks putting on a show in a hot tub

Liquor on my breath flippin' up they dress
Showing me flesh rubbin' my chest when I raise a cigar
