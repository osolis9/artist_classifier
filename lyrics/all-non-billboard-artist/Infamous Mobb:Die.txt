Die:Infamous Mobb
Murda, muzik, all y'all niggas
Infamous, watch ya self

Infamous Mobb
It's over, dunn, it's over
(It's over)
Check it out, dunn
(We got 'em, dunn)

All y'all niggaz, sit there
Like y'all in a classroom
(Stick them, niggaz)

All y'all niggaz, sit there
(Niggaz best list)
Pay attention
(Pay attention)

All y'all niggaz to me is like new to this
I been doing shows and I been living on the road
What y'all wanna know is what you can't know
I been burning down pounds of dro

Ay yo, it's like this, I rep for my clique
Never burn my britches as a youth
I hustled and I played ball too
I regret, not going all the way, coulda been in the NBA

Now I'm in the spotlight, iced out
No way out and thugged out, only child to seed, nigga
Need room to breathe and bud to smoke
This life ain't no joke

Only my clique, I'ma rep and I die 4
One head watch the other, we goin' ride for
Want another when it's time for action
Packin', blastin', rappin', yo whatever

Yo, speak when you spoken to otherwise keep your mouth shut
Niggaz is butt, we liver than fuck, don't get yourself cut
Stalked, stabbed or shanked, be about bank
Criminal uplink but niggaz don't think shit stink

Till shit hit the wind blower, until your man crippled up in the hospital
Fuck, dunn, it's over when we come through, chuck jewels and things
Blow out your brain, keep it simple, Sly, keep it movin'
No evidence involved when we do it

First infantry, first unit, my art theraputic
I'm sharp, the god
I tear through your heart
Hear the sound of the 40 cal bark

Only my clique, I'ma rep and I die 4
One head watch the other, we goin' ride for
Want another when it's time for action
Ppackin', blastin', rappin', yo whatever

I give thanks to the people that's gone, you made me strong
And ready for life out there you betta prepare
Everywhere you at dunn, you betta watch your back
And stay strapped 'cuz these days niggaz don't know how to act

That shit is wack like we on the block sellin' crack but now I rap
And I know God didn't give me this gift
Cuz I put time and dedication to write this shit
You don't wanna see me flip, dunn, I'm sick in the head
The reason, because my other half is dead

So when there's drama, I take it to the fullest extreme
Try to blow ya head off with a M 16
Know what I mean 'comin' from Queens
Where it seems like a dream with thugs
Fake love between each other

Only my clique I'ma rep and I die 4
One head watch the other, we goin' ride for
Want another when it's time for action
Packin', blastin', rappin', yo whatever

Knowha' I mean, dunn
(Faggot ass nigga)
It's QB, nigga
(It's over)

Take it like that dunn, niggaz
Can't fuck wit us, baby
M O B B, Infamous nigga, 2G, we takin' over
(Queensbridge finest)

Just listen to this
(Kick dog)
Just listen to this

Faggot niggas dismissed
