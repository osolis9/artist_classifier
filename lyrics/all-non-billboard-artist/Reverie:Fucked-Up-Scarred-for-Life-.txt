Fucked-Up-Scarred-for-Life-:Reverie
this is the last chance, that im gonna give you
to let me down, only god knows why i feell you
to be real you, are something ive always hated
something that in life i thought was supposed to be sacred
but i had to fake it, take it- in -as a kid
learned in life, you can never depend
on anybody, anything, any set schedule
every time i think ive gotten comfortable, they let go
said so, thats the reason behind everything i do
in fact, impulsive actions brought me to you
seeing thru everything you tried to hide in the beginning
even blind to your reflection & the sinning
that you brag about- when i tag, i mouth
words- underneath my breath, they come out from in my chest
im impressed, that the fabrications that you shoot thru my ears
sounded so pretty, pity party, part- if we, lift thee
blindfold made of bricks, up off my eyes
and the chain to my hips, then i'll realize
all you told was lies, loved to see me cry
& never gonna be another love like you & i
words cannot describe, what i felt inside
demons pushing out from in stomach & i died
that summer that you left me, promised you would get me
exactly what you gave me & it made me
just a little crazy, just enough
to be cold hearted, guarded, interior rough, fuck

left me so fucked up, i think you scarred this bitch for life
boys are just bitches, they play games & some play it right
i dont trust nobody cuz people'r all the same
& dont expect perfection cuz you'll be the one to blame

fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, not nice
never ever gonna trust another slut in in my life
but if i fight, urges that i hold back
fuck her up when i see her & ill make a whole track
about the victory, bitches love the dick ya see
penis is the prize possession- they love to be
imagining, they were me, so they chase after my boyfriends
sucking dicks better than prostitutes, noise ends
toys bend when i slash em, never gonna pass em
cuz im on that p track, hoodrats, we dont need that
see that, i be killing em, apples, i be peeling em
how you like it now? coming down to the ceiling im
sittin on the roof, sitting upside down
at a different perspective & damn i really see it now!
seeing how- i could be so- whats the word?
gullable, & loveable, so mother fuck the world
how could it be so cruel to me when all i do is desecrate it
karma wants ta box & i really fucken hate it
even waited, hesitated--> when she stepped to me
still said it like, bitch, you better bring your best to me

left me so fucked up, i think you scarred this bitch for life
hoes are just bitches, they play games & some play it right
i dont trust nobody cuz people'r all the same
& dont expect perfection cuz you'll be the one to blame
