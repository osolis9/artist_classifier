Goin-Down:Bias B
Gimme a second let me catch some feelings
On the paper the ball point run around
its only lyrics I deal in
Bias B doc Felix got the sound you're hearing
Something so appealing
Don't stand around when the partys going down
Throw your hands at the ceiling now
I've got the illness
Needed to shop from doc Felix
You hit the spot feel it
What we've got be the realist on offer
For like a 20 mill topped up
Couldn't shut the shit down here
Even if the cops rocked up with a cease and desist
Its Bias B and d smit
Its going down like smoke when the roach be leavin the lip
Take 2 hits pass man you're kiddin yourself
