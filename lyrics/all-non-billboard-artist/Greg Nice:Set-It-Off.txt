X5

Peep it: time to blow the horn like little boy blue
Styles I kick stick to the ear like glue
MCs don't gotta clue
That'll be flowing through town like the flu
Hard to be banging my head against the wall
Met me a badass honey at the mall
Babygirl stood about five feet tall
Jet black hair, fat booty and all
Come get down with the man with more than a million flavors
Styles unlimited beeper on my hip celly phone with the chips
Spreading love from my mind same town count the gripp

Hey all I want to know is can I set it off
All I want to know is can I set it uh uh
X5

Lets take it back to the old school
Lets take it to Union Square
Lets take it back to the LQ
Wave your hands like you just don't care

The rap game stressed me made me get the burner
Thought about it pimp it out like Ike Turner
Not a hard head I'm a easy learner
Back in the day boned a girl named myrna
Styles I flip r 'n b even pop
Now matter how I flip I'm a flip hiphop
Pedal to the metal put the icing on the cake
Tea in the kettle get a mansion like Blake
Carrington I'll be down to hate a fake
I got the craving for a philly cheesesteak
My style be butter like land-o-lake
Strictly endo, never no shake

Hey all I want to know is can I set it off
All I want to know is can I set it uh uh
X5

I want a bank account like oprah winfrey
I want a swiss account like bill cosby
George Washington cut down the cherry tree
Three point shot mike j from the key
What's the best tuna? chicken of the sea!
Sipping on the mo-dog and the dom p
Some play life like Monopoly
Why don't you get up get up put the body in motion
Greg N I with the hip hop potion
If your curious and you got the notion
Nothing to it just start the commotion

Lets take it back to the old school
Lets take it to union square
Lets take it back to the LQ
Wave your hands like you just don't care
