Buffalo-Stampede-feat-M-Shadows-of-Avenged-Sevenfold:Cowboy Troy
The first thing that you feel is a rumblin'
The next thing you know everything starts crumblin'
Stumbling and you're trying to escape
So you want to get away from your faith
but you can't but wait!
OH no ain't no discounts
you never want it all yall want the full amount
of the lyrical gumbo not mumbo
when it's stronger then a coffee jumbo
the black buffallo from the GTS
came from my back
and the T on my chest
am I up to the test? aw yes
with my brand new style
so fresh
some folks trying to say I'm old off
showed off
got with my boys and road off
to provide the dust
and tumbleweeds
make way for the buffalo stampede
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
The whole world can change
in the blink of an eye
try not to cry
feel the pain and the pride
and the loneliness
and the phonyness
all I want is the truth
can you show me this?
but you're here to hook beats
your pace quickens
and you're clucking around like chickens
the Buffallo is on a roll
now you know
like I said popo
so tell your momma and them
save your drama for them
tell all your kin folks
your cousins and your friends
and get on over to the Ponderosa
like you know you're supposedta
some folks trying to say I'm old off
showed off
got with my boys and road off
to provide the dust
and tumbleweeds
make way for the buffalo stampede
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
(music break)
one, two, three, four
From Little Big Horn to wounded knee
The trailer kids you'll never find me
and like a cheese boy
you know I'm outlasting
You know I got a hell of a ton of um asking
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
Come and see
the Buffalo is here
safe in bed while my country hits me
want to go out
like a horse and a breakness
