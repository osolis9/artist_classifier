Rhythm-of-Life-Live-:Kindred the Family Soul
I'm watching you from afar babe
Your heavens brightest star babe
Wanting you is exciting
If only in my head & if I was hungry
I'd take you instead
You know we speak with no talk baby
Your smell, your walk baby
So afraid to touch you
But I long for it so
I'm sure that I love you but you
Don't even know

It's like beauty & music
The angels singing a song
Can you hear them?
It's so lovely
It's magic
I know you can feel it say yes

Loving you is a dance
The rhythm of life
And if there's a chance
I want you till I die

And if there's a chance
I want you till I want you
Want ya want ya want you
Said I Want you, want ya, want, ya, want ya
Want you
Said I Want you want ya, want ya want ya
Want you
Said I Want you want ya, want ya want ya
Want you
Said I Want you, want ya, want ya want ya
Want you
Said I Want you want ya, want ya want ya
Want you
Said I Want you want ya, want ya want ya
