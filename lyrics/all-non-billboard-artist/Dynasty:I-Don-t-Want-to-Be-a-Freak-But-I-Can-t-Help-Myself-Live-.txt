I Don't Want To Be Like This
I see you're angry with the things you did
And I know you will be lost until
You find a reason that can make you see my wish

And now I'm watching as you swing your dress
And your friends may cool your own distress
But you could change it all with
Just one kiss, one kiss

'Cause I don't want to be like this... for too long

And the words are racing through my head
But they need to come from you instead
So close your eyes and think of all the things you miss

The days are growing colder now
And I'm lost when you don't come around
But you could change it all with
Just one kiss, one kiss
