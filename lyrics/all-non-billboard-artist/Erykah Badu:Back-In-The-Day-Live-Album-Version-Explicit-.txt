Back-In-The-Day-Live-Album-Version-Explicit-:Erykah Badu
Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well

Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well

Soulflower take me flying with you, hey
Gimme dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Gimme some of dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well

Back in the day when things were cool
We used to meet up with these dudes
Then we'd roll out on hopes and truths
And would ride around the park till it's after dark
Pumpin' the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well, well, well say

Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well

Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well

Soulflower take me flying with you, hey
Just gimme dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Gimme some of dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well

Wailin', and singin', and jammin', and talkin'
And pumpin' the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well, well, well
Da laughin' and singin' and jammin' and talkin'
Pumpin' the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well, well, well

Laughin', and singin', and jammin', and talkin'
And pumpin' the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well, well, well
And we would ride around the park till it's after dark
And when we get home hope the dogs don't bark, puff
Well, well, well

Laughin' and singin' and jammin' and talkin'
And pumpin' the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well, well, well
And we would ride around the park till it's after dark
And when we get home hope the dogs don't bark, puff
Well, well, well

Laughin' and singin' and jammin' and talkin'
And pumpin' the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well, well, well
And we would ride around the park till it's after dark
When we get home hope the dogs don't bark, puff

Puff
