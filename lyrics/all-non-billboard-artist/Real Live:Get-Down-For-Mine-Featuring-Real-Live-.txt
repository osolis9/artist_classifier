Get-Down-For-Mine-Featuring-Real-Live-:Real Live
Yeah son, there's mad kids up here gettin' cream for the 9-6
(True)
Yeah and I been doin' this shit for a long time
Y'know, shootin' game bombs the mind
(A'ight)
And this is a year when mad caps get peeled
So Imma spark this line, kick the real
(Bang em out)

With all this chaos in the realms of the street
Ya, local street thug gots ta make ends meet, true
The average joe is far too slow for this ghetto pro
You better know when I hit the streets I like to glow

I like to glisten and at the same time stay low
Listen, motherfuck the fame, I'm persuin' the dope
My steelo is abolic to a kilo
Cash is poppin', coke' is cokin', fiends is coppin'

Ain't that some shit, a player that's use to livin' rich
Is now a stick-up kid caught up in the ditch
In '94, Giuliani kicked down the door
In '95, niggas flipped to stay alive

Peelin' caps while I laugh in the stash, four and a half
Remy and a glass, sparked the boom then I blast
They wanna confine me, sneak up from behind me
Bust a cap in my back and put me where they can't find me

They hate to see a young player pay
(Naw, they don't wanna see that, Sean)
They'd rather see him spray
But I'm like vinny, a terminator, squeeze and let off
Usin' verbs and nouns like rounds to blow ya head off

Hit nuff spots, heat nuff glocks
If that's what it stops like Columbian blow crops
I'm out get the cream and ain't no doubt in my mind
Fuck this roach shit, I'm hit, I get down for mine

I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
If we gettin' money put ya hands in the air
I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
On the regular, shakin' victims with no fear

I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
If we gettin' money put ya hands in the air
I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
On the regular, shakin' victims with no fear

I hear you wanna be a player, [Incomprehensible] son place your bets
Let's play a game of real nigga roulette
Witness a DOA as I spray the melee
Content and punctuation is compared to AK

You want a daily overdose from pure funk
I'm buckin' off like Tommy 'gain but calm as a Buddhist monk
Decapitatin rappers in my trunk
(What?)

I'm sick, puffin' skunk, bouncin' wit my click, poppin' mega junk
I'm gettin' dank white clouds be zig-zaggin
What's this talk about flippin ki's, c'mon you're nickel-baggin'
I'm blastin off wigs, [Incomprehensible] doubters believe it you see
I was packin' heaters when jokers was bangin' cheerleaders

Ain't nothin' changed, it's still the same in the rap game
I'm known for bangin' rookies out the frame
Y'all done forgot who was the pimp from the start
Sippin' vintage wine eatin a'la carte

I'm phenomenal from the abdominal, far from comical
Lyrics is stickin' the brains like barnicle, never sleep
I'm bringin' the drama to the streets with techniques and rollin' in fleet
Ain't nothin' sweet about the streets, so I'm poetically ill

I'm pure like coka and lyrics shine like fiscelle
I got to bring it at'cha throat and you ain't showin' no signs
K-Def let 'em know I get down for mine

I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
If we gettin' money put ya hands in the air
I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
On the regular, shakin' victims with no fear

I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
If we gettin' money put ya hands in the air
I get down for mine who be gettin' down for theirs?
On the regular, shakin' victims with no fear

I get down for mine, I get down for mine
I get down for mine, I get down for mine
I get down for mine, who be gettin down for theirs?
On the regular, shakin' victims with no fear
