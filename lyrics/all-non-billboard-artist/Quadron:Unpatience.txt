Unpatience:Quadron
I said I was moving mountains
Could have fooled you
I just love the attention

You said I was building a scene
Rewritting the scheme
Well I'm just casting solutions

You know it's just one act out of three
Of the makings of me

Unpatience
Waiting to find my theme
For these scenes
Unpatience
Waiting to find my theme
For these random scenes

Its a script conspired for comfort
Directed by the spectators
My personal lullaby

You know it's just one act out of three...
