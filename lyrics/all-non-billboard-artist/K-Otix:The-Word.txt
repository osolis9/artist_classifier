The-Word:K-Otix
[Verse One: Damien] 
With this mic in my right hand 
I can reshape the face of the world 
And shift sands 
Child, woman, and man stand on command 
Communicating with others across foreign lands 
Understand 
The Word can bring wisdom to a fool 
A destructive weapon 
Or constructive tool 
The words that I speak 
Can give power to the weak 
Courage to the meek 
Hope to the bleak 
The power 
To combine with minds of many kinds 
Whether written or recited 
Or spoken within a rhyme 
In time 
The way my very life is defined 
Crossing over cultural and economical lines 
The ability to break barriers 
Break bread 
Break ground 
Break it up 
Break it down 
Words can contact 
And impact with sound 
Make contracts with verbs 
And attack with nouns 
[Chorus] 
What's the word 
People all around stay bound 
By the Word 
Spoken in tongues 
Or even sung 
What's the Word 
Communicate from state to state 
With the Word 
Live by the Word 
Die by the Word 
[Verse Two: Mic] 
Every match is like a Royal Rumble 
Every man for himself 
With every step I take 
I'm gaining more health 
Ain't no good MCs left 
Cause their minds ain't right 
Wanna get a record deal 
But can't deal with the MIC 
Camouflage couldn't hide you 
From these words I serve 
Check the pulse 
Rappers ain't got the heart or nerve 
Realize 
Looking at fraud guys through God's eyes 
Utilize the mind 
As the guiding light through lies 
Specialize in the rhyme, dialects, and beats 
Enemy crews unite 
But can't compete 
Nor defeat 
Anything like this 
My likeness is priceless 
The two nicest on mic devices 
Is me and D 
Weak MCs 
Yo, we're training 'em 
On the other side of tracks 
In cells bangin' 'em 
My words stimulate the nerves in your cranium 
They want the gold and platinum plaques 
We want uranium 
I flip the game 
To make the players think I'm playing 'em 
My people think I'm evil 
Cause I rhyme with Damien 
K-otix Universal is law 
Leave 'em open-jawed 
Cause the words I say is raw 
[Chorus] 
[Verse Three: Damien (Mic)] 
Many with the power 
Abuse it 
Many with the power know not how to use it (Word) 
I can make a living 
Or bring death 
Initiate a change 
Every time I take a step 
What's left 
If there were no word at all 
See, societies would crumble 
Causing cities to fall 
Even though we speak in various tongues and dialects 
With the Word 
We connect in universal respect 
Check Check 
Bringing attention to the ignored 
Comprehension to whatever wasn't mentioned before 
I can illustrate a clear idea with metaphor 
A mere syllable will have you feeling for more (Word) 
Plus the meanings even change with the trends 
Little words with four letters 
Often seem to offend 
What I say 
Can provoke war 
Or invoke peace 
When I'm speaking through a mic 
It's like my power's increased 
[Chorus]
