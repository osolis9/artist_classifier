Spiritual-Paralysis:Inherit
A burial of the human mind
The dark that all life fears
We are forced to walk through
Our fate is predetermined
Though every fabric of our being
Is telling us this is very wrong
A technology beyond comprehension
Will take our lives
As the swarm approaches
You breathe them into your lungs
The bloodstream carries them
Into your neural system
Systematically mapping the synapses
Then shutting them down one by one
As your body dies your cells are dispeased in
Every direction
Only to be reconfigured in a complex assembly
Of intelligent micro particles
Reborn cold
Your fear is gone
So is your soul
