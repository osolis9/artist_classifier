I-Ain-t-Fucked-Wit-Cha:CJ Mac
[Intro]
"Hey hey, you kids stop fighting, you shouldn't be fighting around me
He black you shouldn't be fighting amongst each other"

"This bitch ass nigga ain't black,
got a white mama bitch named Nicole I know that bitch"

"Boy, what you know about that, whats your name, who is you"

"Nigga i'm Little Suge, I can do what the fuck I wanna do"

Gangsta shit, yeah, right about now
I'm about to get in a little ass
Check shit out nigga, I know you gay ass niggas
May think ya'll gone sexplay me on records nigga
And not have to suffer the consequences and repercussions
Aftermath killa, remember that nigga
That's my shit now, Aftermath killa

[Verse 1]
First off nigga lets lay it on the line
I'm a street motherfucker, ain't no studio in mine
Fuck the gangbang, you know the bangs intact
You know I still walk the block where they bangin at
Still, you can put a record out and sell mills
Still, you be lying about the streets from them hills
Still, you a bitch nigga, everybody know
All that child abusing shit, you niggas took at Death Row
Oh yeah the king of aces, we can lock all night
Two words for Dre nigga, Suge Knight (ha ha)
Watch his coward ass shake and roll
Hope that Simon don't say parole
Back to the hoe swoll
A whole lot of blood shed and killin
For a real nigga walk away from 300 million
Real nigga when you started Death Row
Bitch ass coward when you left with no dough, hoe
Just like a bitch, the man in jail
No you runnin with them other bitches raisin hell
I bet you feeling like a man again
You fuck with J i'll stiff that ass like a manakin

[Chorus]
If you ain't never been to jail, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you ain't never post bail, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you ain't never did a crime, I ain't fuckin wit you
If other niggas write your rhymes, I ain't fuckin wit you

[Verse 2]
Lets see, Eazy fucked Cube
And Eazy fucked Dre
Cube broke the fuck out, but Dre told to stay
Dre dissed Cube, but then he left Eazy
Suge got to fuckin and left your butthole greasy
Took your company and your baby mama
Y'all mark ass niggas don't want no drama
I had the minds in the streets
Meet me at the Compton, the Slauson or any other swap meet
I'll tell you motherfuckers right now
Ain't no sense to fuck with me cos i'm a night owl
Hittman, nigga you through
Co-signing like a bitch from the side lines fool
You better ask that tight jeans wearin ass fag
Ain't a pair of cuffed khakis in the Aftermath camp
Bitch, find that ass stomped
The same niggas got you pumped
Will get your dumb ass dumped
Was you scared when you were stared at
If you were bitch, then get at us when you were mad at
By the way ain't Hittman gay or somethin
And the white boy better not say nothin

[Chorus]
If you ain't never been to jail, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you ain't never post bail, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you ain't never did a crime, I ain't fuckin wit you
If Jay-Z wrote your rhymes, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you shrugged gangsta rap, I ain't fuckin wit you
Got dissed and came back, I ain't fuckin wit you
I ain't kissin no ass, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you down with Aftermath, I ain't fuckin wit you

[Verse 3]
Fuck with street criminals
Street generals
Stick with big butt freaks to beat criminals
Y'all can't run the streets from the house
Fuck the ministry geeks
Real niggas know what i'm talkin bout
Ain't you the nigga said gangsta rap's dead
And rent a new dork to make beats instead
I ain't shittin on the firm
But nigga you respect your roots or get burned
When you gone learn
I got him rappin like babaaloo
Every other record J got some signin to do
I said fuck em in a minute
And fuck all you dick lickin niggas
Tryin to kiss ass and keep your distance
Suge took and made niggas large
I had the motherfuckers suing and pressin charges
I'm a make me a prediction look
I bet before this record drops, Hittman get his ass whooped

[Chorus]
If you ain't never been to jail, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you ain't never post bail, I ain't fuckin wit you
If you ain't never did a crime, I ain't fuckin wit you
If other niggas write your rhymes, I ain't fuckin wit you
