Let-Me-Bang:Kid Sister
Come on, let, let, let, let's go,

Back to reality, back to where I started and I know so well
Back then said I'ma change the game, If I don't I don't know who will
Think I did it, least I'm tryin' to, kinda, sorta, sorta, kinda,
Rap more about some normal girly shit rather than bump and grind
I, I'd like to do it nice and slow but,
fuck that, I need my pace and flow what,
What really makes me happy is a final clearance sale, I go nuts
Well maybe a fresh box of doughnuts on a Sunday
Start my diet Monday
I'ma get around to it one day, But right now let me hear you say
*Not positive the chorus is correct.

*Chorus*
Gotta park it ready man, Gotta rock it steady man,
Gotta get that name on my list VIP get heavy man,
Gotta park it ready man, Gotta rock it steady man,
Gotta get that name on my list VIP get heavy let me bang

Let me bang, let me bang, let me bang
Uh, that's right betta act like you know
That's why I get mobbed everywhere that I go
Every club, every show, every inn, every mall

______ on my profile on low
Ain't got no mention on top of no ho
K- I - to the D - S - I - to the S, T-E-R
Just let me bang
You know by now that you know me by name
And I'm the one rapper remainin' the same
Doin my laundry with pockets of change
Fame and fun don't catch me

*Chorus*
Gotta park it ready man, Gotta rock it steady man,
Gotta get that name on my list VIP get heavy man,
Gotta park it ready man, Gotta rock it steady man,
Gotta get that name on my list VIP get heavy let me bang

Let me bang
(Alright, last verse)
I got shit on lock
If you got shit on lock
Just let me see your run your fingers through your weave
Best believe that we runnin' things
And we get what we want, how we want, when we want
You get it, got it
Please don't catch an attitude
Just because we could flaunt it
And holla if your whip paid
Car no, never late
Gas bill, light bill an' student loans, be straight
Call me, call me bootleg
I sip on Kool Aid
I'm pushin' that hoop-dee
But I'm stackin' that loot ' $Chang

*Chorus *
Gotta park it ready man, Gotta rock it steady man,
Gotta get that name on my list VIP get heavy man,
Gotta park it ready man, Gotta rock it steady man,
Gotta get that name on my list VIP get heavy let me bang

Let me bang, let me bang, let me bang
I do my laundry with pockets of change
Famous in a Hyundai
