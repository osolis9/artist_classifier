Headlights:Justin Warfield
Jesus lookin' out for you, but is he lookin' out for me?
Tired eyes that hold the tears, burn red 'til it's hard to see
Body broken to my bones, but my heart's still pumpin' strong
I've sinned enough for 20 lives so I'm right where I belong

The sky it darkens and the wind blows some old blues
The path gets narrow and there's just two lanes to choose
The road, it opens, and the headlights comin' through
For you

Can't begin to take it back so I best keep moving fast
Faith alone is not enough so I'm doomed to repeat the past
Send an angel quick my way, send an angel or a sign
Close my eyes and give it gas, only God knows if it's my time

The sky, it darkens, and the wind blows some old blues
The path gets narrow and there's just two lanes to choose
The road, it opens, and the headlights comin' through just for you
