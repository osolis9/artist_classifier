Diamonds-Whips:Tito Lopez
(Intro)
Uh, yea sir
I know I’m here, really number one
See I had to go
Take a journey into our lives man
It’s what we do
What we did on a daily basis
Real niggas talkin
And I only hear it
Remember here to bust America
This is what we overcame, what we overcome baby
It’s on the street, ain’t gotta be seen
OBN, GPT

(Verse)
Growing up in the hood I
Always tried to be the good guy
And the prize kept a good eye
And I never had dreams but always been a good fly
Come for me for a good high
But you really said the good die young
A strapped nigga without run
And I’m just whippin to get it
I can whip, I get that
Until you hear them niggas, goodbye
See, most niggas in the hood lie
Oh man, before I was low I was in tone here
I’ve never had time for the chokes
This only grind, trying to ride on the smokes
Folks don’t trip, don’t chatter
My OG told me that it don’t matter
I need a 6 pack on the yard
But I promise when it heat back get it turn up

Gonna run that shit back

It’s my life dedication, grandmamma always said be patient
Brother it’s all over the streets
Never should repeat from under yo education
Nowadays these rap niggas’ a joke
They in here, but just nigga it’s smoke
Shit on the real life gotta get me some water
And freshen up for I choke
I am the one, he got in front
God put me on this earth for a reason
I ain’t got no hit records
But you look in they eyes, I’m who they believe in
Yall don’t believe it
Well we all gonna wait here
But me, I’m bout to put my foot on these niggas nuts
Said they all got the same here
Let the church say oh man

(Hook)
And even though yall see diamonds & whips
We’re just some boys in the hood and we all be grinding the chips
And even though yall see fortune & fame
We’re just some regular niggas that went with hurt through the pain, ah lawd
And even though yall see diamonds & whips
We’re just some boys in the hood and we all be grinding the chips
And even though yall see fortune & fame
We’re just some regular niggas that’s part of the game

(Verse)
Too hood for the niggas that feelin the trap
Then I own this shit, I do it for lookin for rap
Mama told me welcome into, I got in this trap
Get applauded now he really be lookin for crap
You’ve been keen but the streets I’m still in
Could’ve been my own, nigga wanna be there, leggo
Is it open? Like I turn for Cuban
Real nigga too and I pin on juvy
Real ass niggas know how I did here
Old school rock, never mind my brick fair
Big foot 9 even though I get it
One whip good, every day I stay chyeah
Ye ain’t never heard about Truth, tell me to get it
Money over everything, stroll by the city
Next time nigga I’m talkin bout the city
Never know but I’ll get the other from a steak
Never mean that but you don’t know me
Yo life real tech nigga, you an OG
I been the Truth, niggas try to be like me
One word plus niggas try to see it like me
Thinkin of the good time I make in this water
Probably then most competition get slaughtered
Real niggas here, I don’t mean to mess problems
Actin real about the big guy in the water
I don’t think you could’ve take a lot this time
I don’t think you could’ve paid, you’re hard to find
Always stuntin, just send me the trip to sayin
2013, trip the town
All the niggas cryin, my clothes I’m grindin
But you rise on niggas, oh oh I’m downing
Niggas get by over here, I’m shinin
On the way, tell the niggas come find me

(Hook)
And even though yall see diamonds & whips
We’re just some boys in the hood and we all be grinding the chips
And even though yall see fortune & fame
We’re just some regular niggas that went with hurt through the pain, ah lawd
And even though yall see diamonds & whips
We’re just some boys in the hood and we all be grinding the chips
And even though yall see fortune & fame

(Verse)
Had a dream last night that my life got better
Put my name on the contract and I don’t give a cheddar that the haters try to kill me
Even 3 figures, told em work it through the nights when I shine
Big Jaamel, yea but my friends call me Nico
Critics that stick with the government
Please get the fuck out my face and I like these hoes
Worried bout the niggas, I’ll fuck with that 
In the day I was born, ending up chasin the hoes
Thinkin it’s room for dough
Now I’m here with the Chi girls, suckin out my pocket
Out from a Playboy, oh
Got my nigga Rody on the way, he ain’t nothing but a man
But I’m guessing much more, all lovers mix
I need a sugar with the butterfly legs
And I’m angry about my soul
More than fucked up and that’s OD
‘Cuz getting it here to play it my way
Just regular, with a bit of a killer 
Then I got up on the drink
With a pimp to find my support from a big folk, even a gun folk
Even my atlids and my shit Compton
And the last night is for rehearse
Yea, somebody put it down and treat it in this verse
Cuz stunt we, I don’t got time for the dumb shit
All the dumb bitches so don’t rush to me about dumb shit
And don’t be sweatin me for this dumb bitch
But for me you ain’t comin, I know you’re jealous
You don’t sense it in me, I’m illest
And you can get the fuck on
Go right on it, that nigga sucked on GPT
