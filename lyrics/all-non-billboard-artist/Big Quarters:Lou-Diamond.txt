Lou-Diamond:Big Quarters
Back for a second debut, who? BQ wake-up call man I reckon they knew
Head for cover when we stepped into view
Yeah, there's others seven of us, need to make us some room
Thick as thieves FAMFEUD! to break you the news
We're never changing our tune, kids can tease, feel the hatred, it's true
But fill their plates see their faces eat the cake up and chew
I'm intervening, 'tis the season, see my pages in bloom
But still I'm dreaming 'til I wake up at noon
The new phase of rap, all the rage on stages, contagious as flu
I got the bug when not of age, but patience a must
How we came up, dug our break from the dust.

Live from the Back 40, Westside accordions my origins
Uncle play Carlos, Mother play Prince
Lakeside of Marshall my coordinates
Good karma come with good armor, yes it does
Circa 81, birth of a son
Now, we stand up gentlemen, our hands up in everything
Turn it up. grab the flag and burn it up.
Don't need to be famous for police to frame us.
Known handle, brandon all day.
Got a 40 gig - now I sample both channels
Cash money and my hands dusty
05 with a fresh release and new enemies

(Scratch Sample - Phil the Agony) First you got to watch out for
Yourself and your fam cause if you don't watch out, nobody else'll give a
Damn

My branch find peace amidst violence sleep through sirens
And identify with Lou Diamond

Sadly to say, things don't go our way
Start hopping to it, out of order, not a nuisance
Sort of opportunist, roll us over,
Y'all assuming, throw a boulder
Block our movement, no one told us what to do when
Try to barter like, I can offer real solutions
Syphin off of institutions, like it's lawful, problem solver distribution
Still illusions even if you sold a mill of units
Still a student, it's amusing, kill careers before improvement.

A couple shots worth a thousand publications
Same goes for guns in cases, be realistic
That's just my midwest coast slang
My brother in the east say What Up Chief
Press want disputing, cause it's good for distribution
Go figure, mr. Brandon can't win
Rap ora that attract supporters
Characters speak Spanish when they talking guns
Or something that involve two lovers
So take a second to imagine what they think of us
EQ the BQs proper - news in the north
My whole channel pro-vandal young looters and lords

(Scratch Sample - Phil the Agony) First you got to watch out for
Yourself and your fam cause if you don't watch out, nobody else'll give a
Damn

My branch find peace amidst violence sleep through sirens
And identify with Lou Diamond
