Sniffin-Out-the-Snakes:Gemini
What you see ain't what you get
Looks could be deceiving
Delusive love is where it's at, love
Every time you're leaving me
Don't give me your white lies
I'm not one of those guys

I have a way of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
I don't believe in any fairytales
Experience of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
My intuition never fails
You think you fooled me, fooled me
But you made mistakes
Playin' all the games I knew
(All the games I knew)
I can't make it up with you
No can do

You just wait, I'll pick my time
I'm not yours for keepin'
I know you have a busy line
When you say you're sleepin', girl
You must pay for your fun
You're shot with your own gun

I have a way of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
I don't believe in any fairytales
Experience of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
My intuition never fails
You think you fooled me, fooled me
But you made mistakes
Playin' all the games I knew
(All the games I knew)
I can't make it up with you
No can do

You can't go on or turn back
And you can't cover your tracks

I have a way of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
I don't believe in any fairytales
Experience of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
My intuition never fails
You think you fooled me, fooled me
But you made mistakes, baby

Hold on to your heart just in case it breaks, baby
I have a way of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
No second thoughts 'bout doing what it takes, baby
You think you fooled me but you made mistakes, baby
Hold on to your heart just in case it breaks, baby
I have a way of sniffin' out the snakes, baby
No second thoughts 'bout doing what it takes, baby
You think you fooled me but you made mistakes, baby
