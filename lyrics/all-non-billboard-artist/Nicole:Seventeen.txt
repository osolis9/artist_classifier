Seventeen:Nicole
You know
I don't know what's up with this cat
But I know
I know he's gonna be mine

Yes I'm the supa dupa, I'm a superstar
I got a super flow that goes super far
I need a super man that's got a super tan
That can deactivate my body like the super friends

Was the finest guy in school
He got the whole damn school locked
And I thought he was cute
So wanna see, I had to stop

Boy how are you?
And by the way, Nicole is my name
So I slipped him my number
Showed him how us began

Call me if you need someone to talk to
Call me even though I'm seventeen
Call me when you need someone to talk to
Call me, call me

He was only seventeen
And I was checkin' him everyday
And he's no beginner
He made me hot like filled with me

I gotta find a way
To keep all his attention to me
So I slipped him a paper told him
Hit me off at three, hey, call me

Call me if you need someone to talk to
Call me even though I'm seventeen
Call me when you need someone to talk to
Call me, call me

Yes I know I really want him
Yes I know I really need him
Yes I know I gotta have him
You can call me up in the evening

Yes I know I really want him
Yes I know I really need him
Yes I know I gotta have him
You can call me up in the evening

Call me if you need someone to talk to
Call me even though I'm seventeen
Call me when you need someone to talk to
Call me, call me

Sow up this sunshine, what's yours is mine
You won't succeed without tryin', never blind
See I'm the type of female to hold on
Like deodorant I roll on and gets my flow on

I'm livin' in reality, respect me
My image is not a pocket book and I won't get took
Girls get shook when they look, my style is John Blaze
So I'ma make it hot and leave somebody in a daze

Call me if you need someone to talk to
Call me even though I'm seventeen
Call me when you need someone to talk to
Call me, call me
