(Verse One)
Now I don't mean to sound rude, baby or hurt cha or nothin
I want a independent and she workin' with somthing
I want a slim fine woman with some twurk wit her
she ain't got a lot of ass but I can work wit her
I want a big fine woman with some pop wti her
She ain't got a lot of ass but tiddy bop wit her
Now I came here to get it buck
Represent for No Limit you ain't wit it look at the cuck
We need a gurl in the truck she know what's up
We decide we universal and we got the clubs up
So put yo head between yo legs and touch your toes
Bounce yo booty up and down-Ooh girl there you go
Won't yuo walk like a model
If you a independent woman maybe I'ma holla
You got yo hair fixed nice, wit yo clothes tight
You wanna shake it like a dog and do it all night, a all night
