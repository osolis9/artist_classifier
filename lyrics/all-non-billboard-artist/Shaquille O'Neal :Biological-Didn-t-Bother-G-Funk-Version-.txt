Biological-Didn-t-Bother-G-Funk-Version-:Shaquille O'Neal 
Yo, yo, I want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up, 'cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he's my father
'Cause my biological didn't bother

Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad

So we left you with no remorsal pity, took the first bus
From York to Jersey City, women and child alone
Noww that's pressure, mom's got to go to work, drop me off
By Obesa momma, aunt DeDe, whoever aunt Falma, uncle Roy
We stuck together, a year went by and I could walk y'all

Moms got that good ol' job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Mom's offered him a million dollar package deal
She said, "You want me, you gotta take my son"

Or else it's like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it he took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father, 'cause my biological didn't bother

He took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother
He took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother

He took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother
He took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother

January fifth, Phil made a promise, what's that?
He joined the army, we moved to Fort Mamth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age two bottle and my mom shaquille let go
Actin' spoiled, rotten, trippin'

Got a butt whippin' because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin' hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym

He wasn't gone with the wind like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and that's the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he, put me under his wing

Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad but it didn't matter
'Cause I still wanted to be like dad but a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard

Got to watch the knicks, play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts, disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left, I couldn't do a damn thang
With all them F's, age fifteen father and son confrontation

That's nothin' but father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could understand but I'm glad you did it
'Cause now I'm a man, he took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother

He took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother

Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well to be an entrepeneur
And if your making big dope be materialistic
'Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams

I dunked on Patrick Ewing, I won the ring like Hakeem
Oh, what do you know? Biological one's on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money? What people do for money
It's kinda funny to me, he ain't gettin' no check from me, check it

He can go on all the talk shows he want phil is my dad
So don't even front, he took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother

He took me from a boy to a man
So Phil is my father 'cause my biological didn't bother
