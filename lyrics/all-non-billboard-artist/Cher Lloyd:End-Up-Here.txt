End-Up-Here:Cher Lloyd
Boy I was watching you move
Sorta checking you out
Loving what you do
Boy we ought to paint thetown

You gon' watch me get through it
Double roll and lean
Make up your mind if you're liking what you see

Don't want no flowers
Don't buy me no gifts
I need somebody who can take care of this
I don't know what you do cos I know you do it well
You got your game tight real smart I can tell

Please don't play that usual game
That type to put out your flame

I don't wanna shed a tear
And I didn't wanna end up here
Could you get me that dress that you throw right round?
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down
I didn't wanna end up here

Yeah I win through your phone
I didn't like what I see
You promised you'd be true
You make a fool out of me

My friends tryna warned me that I'd waste my time
I saw your true colours almost lost my mind
Looks like you do the same to all your other girls
Except you bought them flowers
You bought me pearls

When you're going out tonight
I know you're seeing her again
See your picture together
So now you're kissing all your friends

Please don't that usual game
That type to put out your flame

I don't wanna shed a tear
And I didn't wanna end up here
Could you get me that dress that you throw right round?
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down
I didn't wanna end up here

If I don't' leave right now
With my wounds still open
Slip right through your hands
And my heart is broken
I'm moving on yeah yeah
I'm moving on yeah yeah
I'm moving on yeah yeah
I'm moving on

I don't wanna shed a tear
And I didn't wanna end up here
Could you give that dress that you throw right round?
Give me that stuff make you wanna get down
I didn't wanna end up here
