Hey all you hick chicks dixie divas and you southern bells
All you redneck women let me hear you yell
All you hick chicks dixie divas and you southern bells
All you redneck women let me hear you yell
All you hick chicks dixie divas and you southern bells
All you redneck women let me hear you yell
All you hick chicks dixie divas and you southern bells
All you redneck women let me hear you yell

Get up move your body to the beat
Witness the dope lyrics that I speak
Get this deep into your cranium
Drop it like it's hot til you're glowing like uranium
Country girls in the cowgirl hats wit the tattoos on their back
In the middle right above the waistline
Hold up y'all here comes the bass line
You like that 808 rattling feeling in your crack
With the wail tai

Playing games with your man all evening
Cuz you know your gonna leave here steaming
Country girls keep a romance thick
that's why all the fellas want a hick chick

Hey all you hick chicks dixie divas and you southern bells
All you redneck women let me hear you yell
All you hick chicks dixie divas and you southern bells
All you redneck women let me hear you yell

Got the boys all checkin out your milkshake
Each one tryin to figure what it'll take
To get your name or possibly your email
Cuz you're a straight up countrified female
Like the fella that you met at the grocery
He was everything a man was supposed to be
But you took him to the club and he couldn't dance
Ease up girl give teh boy another chance
We all know you want a man who can step
Knows how to move can dance two-step
You're the one all the girls wanna be
You're the one all the boys come to see

Is he watching all right girl do it right
Do that little move that you know he likes
The way you got him is the way you're gonna keep him
So he ain't out on the low creepin'
Country girls keep a romance thick
That's why all the fella's want a hick chick
