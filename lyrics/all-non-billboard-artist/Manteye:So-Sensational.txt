So-Sensational:Manteye
Oh Eddie's got a silver shadow
Gonna take it out on the street tonight
And Louie's got a volkwagen
Top down when the moment is right
And don't ever kid yourself honey
These boys mean business
They come from the other side of town
To do a little living, it's poetry in motion
And they ain't gonna stop until 
They bring this city down

Now I've got a girl 
Her hair is strawberry blond
She's smoldering hot
And were sittin' at the pony express
By the sign in the parking lot
And I don't know how long that I can go on
Doing time with somebody I've been living without
But I'm gonna find a way somehow baby 
If I have to give away everthing
This city's got
Chorus
It's so sensational to be out on the street tonight
It's so sensational, it takes so little just to make it to the bottom line
So sensational
Honey give me a kiss so I can check your temperature twice yea

There's a sign on the freeway
Tell you which way to follow this road uptown
When you get to the first set of lights
Turn left or you'll never make it off this merry go round
I see a lot of young blooded fortune hunters
It looks like some kind of tourist trap
Gonna do a little livin', it's poetry in motion
And they ain't gonna stop
Until they get the city back
It's so sensational to be out on the street tonight
It's so sensational, it takes so little just to make it to the bottom line
So sensational
Honey give me a kiss so I can check your temperature twice yea
I see a lot of young blooded fortune hunters
It looks like some kind of tourist trap
Gonna do a little living, it's poetry in motion
And they ain't gonna stop
Until they get the city back
It's so sensational, to be out on the street tonight
It's so sensational, it takes so little just to make it to the bottom line
It's so sensational, to be out on the street tonight
It's so sensational, it takes so little just to make it to the bottom line
It's so sensational
Honey give me a kiss so I can check your temperature twice yea
Now Eddies got a silver shadow, gonna take it out on the street tonight
