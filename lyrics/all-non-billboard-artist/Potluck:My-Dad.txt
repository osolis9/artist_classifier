My-Dad:Potluck
That's my dad
That's my dad

I'll never forget you Wassup pops Wassup Wassup pops
I'll never forget you That's my dad

I'll never forget you

Nobodies perfect that's what you told me and it's true
Yeah we used to fight a lot but now everything is cool
Always been there when I needed never once did you leave
It might be small but it meant so much when you took me to little league
Always into music always cared and was a friend to me
Picture this, old white dude bumpin Public Enemy
Despite the powers kinda like Flower Power see he was a hippie and he taught me that we all the same really
That's my dad
The only one I had
And when I looked around alotta kids didn't have
Hell yeah we had our differences but now they seem small
You helped me out for real when my backs against the wall
Now you're pushing 63 and you're still going to shows

I'm glad you got your health cause in this world you never know
And if you weren't around I don't know what I would do
And I know I don't say this a lot but "Hey dad, I really love you".

I'll never for get you.
Ever since a seed gave me everything I need showed me how to breathe
That's my dad
I'll never forget you
You always have a plan you did everything you can to make me a man
That's my dad

I'll never forget you
Find a girl to cook you dinner never hit her always try to be a winner
I'll never forget you
That's my dad
I'll never forget you

Wassup Pops I got a couple things I have to say
Some thoughts that you deserved to hear before you passed away
You gave me life and you're the reason why I act this way
It's all because of you I stand here as a man today
You taught me how to ride a bike and how to live my life
You taught me wrong from right when to talk and when to fight
You told me educate yourself knowledge is the key
That's why I graduated Humdodlt State College Degree
You was a hustla mansions to motels
I watched you try and fail

While moms was gettin high as hell
I watched you struggle everyday to make the ends meet
I watched you keep it positive and smile in defeat
You told me I'd understand when it was said and done
You told me I would have the same hard headed son
You never looked back you did what you had to do
I promise you I'll give our family all you wanted to

I'll never for get you.
Ever since a seed gave me everything I need showed me how to breathe

That's my dad
I'll never forget you
You always have a plan you did everything you can to make me a man
That's my dad
I'll never forget you
Find a girl to cook you dinner never hit her always try to be a winner
I'll never forget you
That's my dad
I'll never forget you
