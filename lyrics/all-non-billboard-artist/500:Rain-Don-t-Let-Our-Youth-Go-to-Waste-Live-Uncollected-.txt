Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste
I need a walk by the flowers
Let some of it shimmer off ...
Looks like nobody could take your place
And I could bleed in sympathy with you
On those days
And I could drink up everything you have
Don't let it go to waste

I could show you memories
To rival Berlin in the Thirties
I understand you're ...
And I could bleed in sympathy with you
On those days
And I could drink up everything you have
Don't let it go to waste

Say something warm, say something nice
I can't to see you when you're cold
Nor can I stand being out of your life
And I could bleed in sympathy with you
On those days
And I could drink up everything you have
Don't let our youth go to waste
