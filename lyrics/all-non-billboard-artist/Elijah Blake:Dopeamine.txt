I brought that O.G., roll it up, breathe it in, then blow me some
Low key, we be fuckin' around but don't tell 'em nothin'
Yeah, they just don't know
What my name is saved as in your phone

Personal shit, they'll never get
Don't show them the one
You know the one (The one of my mmm)
Hundreds of pics, video flicks
Don't say you deleted them
They come in handy when you

Need love, when all you get is lust baby
No trust baby, aww
You dancing for them dollar bills when I‘m the one baby, ohh

'Cause you're my late night
Always on my mind, Xana White
She up in

Magic City, Monday night do it all again Mix that xana, with that white, do it all again
Catch a flight to KOD, do it all again
Catch a flight to KOD, do it all again
Magic City, Monday night do it all again
Mix that xana, with that white, do it all again (Again)
Catch a flight to KOD, do it all again (Again)
Catch a flight to KOD, do it all again (Again)

Throwin' Benji's, Benji's, Benji's, its a fuckin' pay day
Try'na juggle all this money like it's Cirque Du Soleil
Pull the reefer, speakin' Spanish so I told her "Ole'"
All that, wait, don't play, ohhh

Personal shit, they'll never get
Don't show them the one
You know the one (The one of my mmmm)
Hundreds of pics, video flicks
Don't say you deleted them
They come in handy when you

Need love, when all you get is lust baby
No trust baby, oh
You're dancin' for them dollar bills when I'm the one baby, oh!

'Cause you're my (Girl you know you're my)
Late night (Always on my mind)
Always on my mind, Xana White
And we do it all again

Magic City, Monday night do it all again (Again)
Mix that Xana, with that White, do it all again (Again)
Catch a flight to KOD, do it all again (Again)
Catch a flight to KOD, do it all again
