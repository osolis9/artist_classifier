I-Got-Another-Man:Kat Dahlia
I've got to go
I've got to run
I'm on my way
You trying to stop me
Now you've got a thousand things to say
Well you've got five minutes, babe
I've got to catch my train
And now you're on one knee
You pray you pray
Get out my way

It's too late
I won't stay
It's always wam bam
Then a "thank you ma'am"
It ain't long till you're back on your phone again

I got another man
He loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games
He don't play no pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal
That's where I stand
You look at me like I'm a vegetable
Just cold and bland

I got another man
He loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games
He don't play no pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal
That's where I stand
You look at me like I'm a vegetable
Just cold and bland

He's oh so warm
He's like the sun and every day
Ain't even got to ask just to know if he misses me
I say, 'How you gonna show me love for eternity? '
He says, 'Baby, where there's a will, there's a way'

It's too late
I won't stay
It's always wam bam
Then a "thank you, ma'am"
Then your back to your bad habits again

I got another man
He loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games
He don't play no pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal
That's where I stand
You look at me like a vegetable
Just cold and bland

I got another man
He loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games
He don't play no pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal
That's where I stand
You look at me like a vegetable
Just cold and bland

He loves to kiss and tell me how I do it so well
Now you're ringing my bell
You've got your dreams up for sale
Oh baby
Well I ain't buying
I'm tired of trying
Trying is tiring
Underused
Not where I stand

I got another man
He loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games
No he don't play pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal
That's where I stand
You look at me like a vegetable
Just cold and bland

I got another man
He loves to hold my hand
No he don't play no games
No he don't play pretend
He always puts me on my pedestal
That's where I stand
You look at me like a vegetable
Just cold and bland
