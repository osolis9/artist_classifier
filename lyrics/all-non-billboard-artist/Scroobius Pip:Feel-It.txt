Feel-It:Scroobius Pip
After the party,
I took her back to my parlour,
A little nervous laughter,
Locking the door,
Her stockings fall onto the floor,
Desperate fumble.

Nobody else can share this,
This becomes one on one makes one,
Glorious union,
It could be love,
Or it could be just lust,
It'll be fun,
It would be wonderful.

I feel it,
I feel it,
Feel it my love,
I feel it,
I feel it,
Feel it my love
I need it,
I feel it,
Feel it my love,
Feel it,
See what you're doing to me, to me.
See what you're doing to me.

God but you're beautiful,
And you feel my warm heart,
Working around,
Don't pull away.
My passion always wins,
So keep on moving in,
Keep on tuning in,
Synchronize rhythm now.

I feel it,
I feel it,
Feel it my love,
I feel it,
I feel it,
Feel it my love
I need it,
I feel it,
Feel it my love,
Feel it,
See what you're doing to me, to me.
See what you're doing to me.
