Fade-Away:Fiend
Lie down on the surface
Close your eyes
Listen the sound of grace
Your shaky hands
Tear your life
Before the eyes of your best friends

Run!

Your name is forgotten
In my frights
The end of the line is forbidden
In a beginning of the end
After the dark
All colors will be blend

Run!

Fade away!
Your life will pass before your eyes
Fade away!
It's not the end of your dreams
Fade away!
I will catch all your frozen tears
Fade away! Run!

Run fast as you can
Don't look your back
Feel the cold breathing of death
Your clothes will fall
Down on sand
Your weeping soul will disappear

Fade away!
Your life will pass before your eyes
Fade away!
It's not the end of your dreams
Fade away!
I will catch all your frozen tears
Fade away! Run!
