Tongues-Knives:Alchemist
Spray me with deceit
Facts distort and die
Convinced you lies are truth
Your flaccid mouth the proof

Lick tongues and licking knives
All your words are lies
You preach vast imagination
Fool yourself into hypnotisation

And so you laugh, not to my face
Expect me to trust, you're a disgrace
Sharp is your tongue, as sharp as steel
Blunt is your knife - it's the way I feel
Continuous slobber springs forth from your fucking face
Convinced your lies are truth. Listen to no one
You can't be wrong because your mouth is the proof
