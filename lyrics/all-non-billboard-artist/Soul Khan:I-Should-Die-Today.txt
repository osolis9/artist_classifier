I-Should-Die-Today:Soul Khan
With everything I need in me girl
I’m saying, everything here
Was once such sweet sweet love
It was a summer unlike any other, loving was hot and heavy
Plus she had crazy legs, so we was rocking steady

Should have known better, soul
Homie, you ain’t gotta tell me
Daydreaming in this meadow of steel
I was a couple of levels above head over heels
Physique that could weaken a celibate monk
Sweetheart demeanor was a delicate front
We were both especially young
So anything that I expected was ahead of the gun
But one night, she wasn’t checking her phone
I should have left it alone, but I knew she had that nose that tended to run
I was stressing and panicking, had abandonment issues
I was texting and calling, hollering like damn it, I miss you
She said she’s deading it, I said you know the past that i’ve been through
But she ain’t even wanna talk about it, so all I thought about it was
With everything I need in me girl
I’m saying, everything here
Was once such sweet sweet love
Now here’s the part of it I never really brought up before
Cause I ain’t wanna trouble my sister and mom anymore
But since the beat is still rolling and I gotta record
Let’s address the messes I made soon as I walked out the door
For starters, I was drunk daily
Stuck in a rut a paleontologist couldn’t dig me out of to unveil me
Soul was the titanic, no boat or a life jacket
Another week of this and my blood would become bailey’s
Like what the hell’s occurring?
Waking up in union square smelling like somebody else’s urine
Clothes moldy like I never knew they sell detergent
Overdramatic acting like I was in hell and burning
Or sometimes sitting on the train platform, letting my legs dangle
Thinking maybe I should jump down, getting my flesh mangled
Luckily hesitated and stopped my decline
And reconnected with some friends who told me I would be fine, I told ‘em
With everything I need in me girl
I’m saying, everything here
Was once such sweet sweet love
