MCF:Cappadonna
Black solidarity day, arrest sentence
Lookin' at the moon he starts his coming soon
High like my man, c'mon give me the fame
This flame is so bright, open up your life

Let me swim with your feelings
I love ya'll to death get married to my song
I prolong nigga my style is real strong
Plus I stay dipped like the first day of school

Blood pool kid with the low cut fade
My darts is number one, playtime is over
Black October, my debt still correct
Revised and updated from the old temple

Big pens is Tai Chi
Head crack shit my brains is Jet Li
Put away your weapons it's Master M.C
One hundred skills if you ever try to fuck me

Feet come first, sometimes not the head
Some niggas eat, some don't get fed
If you live by the sword you might die by the lead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick

MCF mean you're thinking with your head
Money comes first, this time I can't dead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick
MCF mean you're thinking with your head

Warp in the projects watch out for Ted
Hearse get your first, too late, no paramed
Dark Park Hill day, cold and sour
It's only Staten Island that represent the power

God body we stand, unite kid right
With the excellent beam of light, so stand still
Hold your breath the late homicide hill
Before the big gates everything was chill

Shaolin, it's like Hurricane Kim
SU, you better beware we comin' in
Original, yeah it's the kid from back then
To all the pussy niggas that be tryin' to pretend

MCF killa bees son, what you gotta problem?
Deja vu, 45 slug that escalates
Don't perpetrate hip hop is mine
Find something else, words is dealt quarterly

In a orderly fashion, thrashin'
Black mama javelins travellin'
Once again dun try to comprehend
Catch a split end

Feet come first, sometimes not the head
Some nigga's eat, some don't get fed
If you live by the sword you might die by the lead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick

MCF mean you're thinking with your head
Money comes first, this time I can't dead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick
MCF mean you're thinking with your head

Im takin' trips downtown havin' the shit go down
Fresh niggas, fresh hats sometimes I carry gats
Low straps baggy slacks one forced the chain
With the six gold caps

I go for dolo, hear my LP style for solo
Han solo with his rap star wars goin' on tours
For the cause whirlwind, record spin walk forward
Explorin' the lime livin' plus thank heads forgivin'

But sue the ones that don't, cappa's goin' gold
Never sold my soul, twenty somethin' years old
Try for the globe one time tastin' the wine
Teeth are dumb, deaf and blind

Have strength to go the whole length
For my two seeds house these
Tooth fairies, February sanctuaries
Child support court days are too short
I'm completin' all my goals

Stay amped up be alert, secure the foundation
Seek more education that money can never worth
Head first, feet first whatever the case
MCF means fuck off kid, you outta place

Feet come first, sometimes not the head
Some nigga's eat, some don't get fed
If you live by the sword, you might die by the lead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick

MCF mean you're thinking with your head
Money comes first, this time I can't dead
You get what you get if you thinking with your dick
MCF mean you're thinking with your head
