Illusions-for-the-King:The Jokerr
It was just another show
There in the front row sat a girl
Young and fair with a stare through her hair
Of old fashioned curls

But through the spectacle in all of its grandeur
I watched her from the stage
She never cracked a smile
Just held her that cold warning gaze
As if to say...

Sing me another song Cinderella's gone
And she's not coming back so long
Let her go on, she's gone
Bring me another day
Then send me along my merry way
Illusions for the King
Don't work on me at all

When I saw her in that hall
Her image burned a hole in my mind
I tried so hard to find her
But from everyone to whom she was described
I was told she had long ago died

But when the crowd rose
And when the curtains closed
She was sitting there alone
And oh, I was terrified
When she said...

Sing me another song Cinderella's gone
And she's not coming back so long
Let her go on, go on
She's gone
Bring me another day
Then send me along my merry way
Illusions for the King
Don't work on me at all

Now here in my cage
I can see how we've all bought the lie
A promise of solace
That only exists in our minds
For love is just apathy
Disguised as a stranger in need
And now the ghost of that woman
Is the mother of the anger in me
