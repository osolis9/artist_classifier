Whatever-You-Want-feat-Dwaye-Wiggins-:Lighter Shade of Brown
What's going on between them sheets?
Some good love making, ODM, with the tella-trick
I ain't loving them, what's your name?
What's your game? What's your size?
Look deep into my eyes, while I'm rubbing up in thighs
Surprise, tell me how you want it, I'll get up on it
And it just don't stop, I see the way you looking at me close
You got your hands around my neck, as you curl up your toes
What that mean? Is it real good, when you call your name
And make it feel good, (straight up), I'm taking about everlasting
You keep doing what you doing, I'm forever blasting
I got you creaming, you got me fiending, no longer dreaming
Ha, say hello to mister semen baby, conjunction function
Nice seduction, Whatever U Want, call me next luncheon
Whatever U Want, oh baby, girl you know I'll take a ride
Whatever U Need, so just relax and let me ride
Whatever U Want, baby, girl you know I'll take a ride
Whatever U Need, with anything that's on your mind
Now baby look into your eyes, as I dip between your thighs
Climax at an ultimate high, we fly, (ecstasy, you and me
We can be, fantasy), now baby can you feel me, one-on-one
As you come out them clothes, but leave on them pumps and pantyhose
Now that's for sure, and I'm going make it real hot
Take a trip down south and blow-up your G-Spot
I know you need it, you know I need it, got a little something
To keep you heated, as I run around in your playground
And put my hand in your sand, cause you know that I'm the man
So let me see it from behind, knowing that's all fine
With a little bit of bump and grind, (so just relax and let me ride)
Whatever U Want, oh baby, girl you know I'll take a ride
Whatever U Need, so just relax and let me ride
Whatever U Want, baby, girl you know I'll take a ride
Whatever U Need, with anything that's on your mind
And I'll take you out on a date with that, all right
(Girl you know I'll take a ride)
Or you can just come and chill by my side, all night
(So just relax and let me ride)
Buy you things and diamond rings, yeah
(Girl you know I'll take a ride)
I'm going to take you to paradise
(With anything that's on your mind)
Whatever U Want, girl you know I'll take a ride
Whatever U Need, so just relax and let me ride
Whatever U Want, girl you know I'll take a ride
Whatever U Need, with anything that's on your mind
Whatever U Need, with anything that's on your mind
