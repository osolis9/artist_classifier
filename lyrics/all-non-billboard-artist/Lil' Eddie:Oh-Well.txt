Oh-Well:Lil' Eddie
(yeah...oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Baby it's so hard that I try
But how could I be the man that you want me to be
If it ain't really ain't me
Baby it wasn't the right time for us to be
And I'm sorry that I didn't see
That it came from me.

Oh well
I can't change the fact that you're gone
There's really nothing I could do now
Should've known that I failed
To treated you like I did
Oh well
There's nothing left to do but move on
How can I keep letting you down
Baby nobody else going to love you like I did

Baby deep inside it's killing me
'Cause I know it's to late for change
And the love ain't the same
But baby it wasn't the right time for us to be
And I'm sorry that I didn't it see
That it really came for me.

Oh well
I can't change the fact that you're gone
There's really nothing I could do now
Should've known that I failed
To treated you like I did
Oh well
There's nothing left to do but move on
How can I keep letting you down
Baby nobody else going to love you like I did

How many times should I say sorry
Before you will forgive me
How many nights will I be lonely
Before you come back to me
How many times should I say sorry
Before you will forgive me
How many nights will I be lonely
Before you come back to me

Oh well
I can't change the fact that you're gone
There's really nothing I could do now
Should've known that I failed
To treated you like I did
Oh well
There's nothing left to do but move on
How can I keep letting you down
Baby nobody else going to love you like I did

Oh well
I can't change the fact that you're gone
There's really nothing I could do now
Should've known that I failed
To treated you like I did
Oh well
There's nothing left to do but move on
How can I keep letting you down
Baby nobody else going to love you like I do

Wish I could take back those blue skys
That I sewed you under
I can't change time, so I must move on
yeah, yeah...
