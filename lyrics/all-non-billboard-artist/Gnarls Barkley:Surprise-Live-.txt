Surprise-Live-:Gnarls Barkley
It's cool being the only one but it's lonely
I could have fallen in the stove
A thousand times before
If only someone had known me

They say there's someone for everyone
Oh, plus the word will be never done
When all you need is to be met half way
But nobody tried

Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
Needless to say it's a wonderful day
I just noticed how nice it was to know ya

Oh, but be ready to sacrifice
If you love him you should tell him twice
Because when everything that's alive
Ultimately dies, oh Lord

Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised

Somebody's watching
Maybe you want 'em to see you
But with your regrets and secrets
You don't really want them to be you

Well, you can make believe I'm that
And for now I'll be just fine
But when the child grows up to have more
Than just your eyes

Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised

Now the ending to every story is most enchanting
Now whether it's heaven or hell
I wear it well
Please forgive me for rambling

I just wanted ya'll
To know that I don't know it all
So when that big ole smile ends up
Being just a disguise

Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised
Oh Lord

Don't be surprised
Oh Lord
Don't be surprised

I said, "Don't be, don't be surprised"
There's nothing left in here
That's surprising, baby, 'prising, baby
