I-Am-the-Monument:Caviar
Fine, fine, I needed to unwind
Don't say another word
I know your lines from here

I'm pillar of wood and from the score
A special burnt bread, orange and more

I am the monument of what
All perfect part enclosed inside
I am the monument of what
Perfect sign

Fried, I'm on the other side
I've left them all behind
They look like dots to me

Blind, I needed to unwind
Don't say another line
I know the script from here

I'm pillar of wood and from the score
A special burnt bread orange and more

I am the monument of what
All perfect part enclosed inside
I am the monument of what
Perfect sign

I'm not straight
I'm not straight
I'm the stranger kid

I'm not straight
I'm not straight
I'm the stranger kid

I'm not straight
I'm not straight
I'm the stranger kid
