Fire-On-The-Inside:Pillar
Days were so cold
Nights spent alone
Searching for that something that I've never known

Held captive by the pain
Caught up in all the shame
My heart just won't stop playing these head games

It's like a terminal disease and now I've found a remedy

It's You, You're keeping
You're keeping me alive with this fire on the inside
It's You, You're keeping
You're keeping me alive with this fire on the inside

Now I see the sun, the battle wages on
I gotta watch my back this time
So I know where it's all coming from

It's like a shadow I can't see and it's sneaking up on me

You, You're keeping
You're keeping me alive with this fire on the inside
It's You, You're keeping
You're keeping me alive with this fire on the inside

It's You, You're keeping
You're keeping me alive with this fire on the inside
It's You, You're keeping
You're keeping me alive with this fire on the inside
