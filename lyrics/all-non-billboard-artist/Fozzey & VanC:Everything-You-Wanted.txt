Everything-You-Wanted:Fozzey & VanC
Do you know what it's like,
Getting up every morning,
Feeling hopeless,
Feeling like the love of your life 
is waking up with the wrong man, 
But at the same time
Hoping that she still finds happiness,
Even if it's never gonna be with you.
Sorry. 
Don't, love means never having to say you're sorry.

I could've given you everything you wanted,
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.

Yeah, what's the point to this?
Baby, whats' the point to this?
How can this be a fairytale if you don't even 
wanna help me write this script?
I thought that we'd last forever,
but it's overdone.
You'll fuck those feelings, you couldn't
overcome

But why cheat, why cheat?
Tell me why'd you fucking cheat!
Why'd you go and fuck another guy 
right after fucking me?
Like didn't I do it, didn't I do it
all the more shit, yeah.
We've been through it, 
still I'm here, still I care,
still believe in this love so rare.

My first love, my first love,
probably my worst love.
I still remember how she said 
"I promise I won't hurt you"
but, but, but, you did, and I'm gone
and know that, just know that.

I could've given you everything you wanted,
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.

She says I'm pushing her away,
but I know she loves me so she stays.
Now she's crying, and I'm lying.
Don't know how we got to this.
Yeah, she's cussing and we're fighting
and I'm trying but I miss how we used to be,
back then when everybody made fun of me.
You tell 'em get lost, you tell 'em get stuffed.
He'll be the one to come and break your heart.
But she loves me, girl I know you love me,
so I won't have to look back and say.

I could've given you everything you wanted,
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.
I could've given you everything you wanted, 
everything you needed.
