People-Hold-On:Coldcut
People hold on

Everybody's looking for a meaning
Everybody's doing their own thing
And nobody's solving the problem
Ain't nobody helping each other

Some people give into fear
Some people give into hunger
Some of us live for the future
Some of us wonder

Give a little light, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Give a little hope, and a little trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone

People hold on
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on
We've got to be strong
People hold on

Everybody's getting frustrated
Why should we live with this hatred
We've all dancin' on a thin line
They're makin' out, we're having a good time
So who's gonna give us the answer, sister and brother

Give a little life, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone

People hold on
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on
We've got to be strong
People hold on

People hold on
People hold on to it
People hold on
You know you gotta do it

Give a little light, give a little love
Maybe there's enough for everyone
Give a little hope, and a little trust
Maybe there's enough for everyone

People hold on
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on
We've got to be strong

People hold on
It won't be long
People hold on
We've got to be strong

People hold on
Don't do yourself wrong
People hold on
