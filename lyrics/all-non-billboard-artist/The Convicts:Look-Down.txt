Look-Down:The Convicts
Look down, Look down
Don't look 'em in the eye
Look down, Look down,
You're here until you die

Now prisoner 24601,
Your time is up
And your parole's began
You know what that means

Yes, it means I'm free

No!
Follow to the letter your itinerary
This badge of shame
You shall show until you die
It warns your a dangerous man

I stole a loaf of bread!
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving.

You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law

Or the meaning of those 19 years
A slave of the law

Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to run
Yes, 24601

My name is Jean Valjean

And I am Javert
Do not forget my name,
Do not forget me,

Look down, Look down
You'll always be a slave
Look down, Look down
You're standing in your grave.
