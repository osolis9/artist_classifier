I-Need-Speed:Capone
Yea, yea, yea, what' up ya'll, this is your boy capone is it not me?
Got my voice filter on the track, killin'them, ... that's good money
For those homies who're drivin' the cars to auto miles plus
This one's for you, no seatbelt wearers
Buckle up, it's the law! i'll tell you like this:
You wanna' see me at house point
I'm from new york city, i like drag racing out here
I'll start it like this

Ain't nobody driver can stop when drippin' through the rain
Got the nitro button insane you donuts in the rain
Like six wheel impala hollow, you got rims
Get a car, can you paint it famous and i got rims
Like mary ... i'm heavy upon that gas pedal
Breakin' competition i'll deeply get the brass medal
V12 you can't see me, i'm takin' over with speed

I got a fast car I'll crash for the bash ya'all

I need speed!
When i fly through the hood, the ... the mood
In 24's lookin good, ah ah!
Don't want the keys!
The big body cool drivers, the big truck and' all riders
We let noone get by us, aha ah!
I need speed!
When i'm racin' that strip i got the button' n' chip
The car like tells me to strip, ah ah!

Don't want the keys!
The . to describe who ever put in the dollar, hollow, we see a car hotter

Yo!!
I'm cuttin' corners like i'm crazzy
I know how to burn a strip
Me and my car got a bomb like we . keep
Go with the 5'th, go with the 4'rth
Break it back down to third
Break it back up to 6'xth once around this curve
I feel the tension, not to mention
The intervention from the coppers
We got pay bills, pay the ticket, only flex, that ain't gonna' stop us!!!
Do look sure from the posh or red line

Once i'm crossed the finish you know that i's bad time
What more can i say, I'm true to this
My car's got a computer chip with no speed the way it's loosin' it!!

I need speed!
When i fly through the hood, the ... the mood
In 24's lookin good, ah ah!
Don't want the keys!
The big body cool drivers, the big truck and' all riders
We let noone get by us, aha ah!
I need speed!

When i'm racin' that strip i got the button' n' chip
The car like tells me to strip, ah ah!
Don't want the keys|!
The ... to describe who ever put in the dollar, hollow, we see a car hotter

And ya'all i'm in a need for speed
My rock's stampeed with horses four fourty
In that c.o. coop the rims with the .
Cuz' i don't obey when red say stop and green say go
I fly by through your ghetto in the ufo
Unidentified foreign object
You can't believe that aston martin is barelin' your projects
No matter what happin', it's elementry watchin'

Cuz after you bench you might not beat that tricked out .
Can't lose the battle when ur' whole clicked out watch
And my car comes equiped with smoke screen and spit out rackets
Just rub your engines, pop the clutch, burn out
I'll show you how a real race turned out .

I need speed!
When i fly through the hood, the ... the mood
In 24's lookin good, ah ah!
Don't want the keys!
The big body cool drivers, the big truck and' all riders
We let noone get by us, aha ah!

I need speed!
When i'm racin' that strip i got the button' n' chip
The car like tells me to strip, ah ah!
Don't want the keys!
The . to describe who ever put in the dollar, hollow, we see a car hotter
Ahh huh ah!
Yeah man! i need speed man!
All you race car drivers out there
Everybody with the fast cars
Keep goin' as fast as you can baby, don't look back!
(he's got a fast car)
