Will-I-Ever:Lyfe Jennings
Does it feel like you're never gonna find it?
And does it feel like you're always one step behind it?
And does it feel like you're out in this world alone?
'Cause you been looking and praying for love so long

Does it feel like you're wishing on a falling star?
Does it feel like you're lonely and it breaks your heart?
'Cause it feels like you're ready to let down your guard
Finding somebody's just so hard

How do you find the one you dream about?
(How do you find it? Yeah)
If I knew I'd tell you how
(Swear to God, swear to God)
It's kinda hard for me to figure out
(And I know you're ready to settle down)
I know you're ready to settle down
(If there's a God above please tell us)

Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
(Will I ever fall in love?)
Or will I be alone forever?
(I just gotta know)
Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
(Will somebody please tell me?)
Or will I be alone forever?

Does it feel like you're moving too fast?
And does it feel like you want something you can't have?
And does it feel like you're living in the past?
And the thought of going home alone again makes you sad?

Does it feel like you're feeling so bad?
Does it feel like you're getting so mad?
'Cause it feels like you just want someone to call
To tell you that you're human after all

How do you find the one you dream about?
(How do you find it? Yeah)
If I knew I'd tell you how
(Somebody tell me, tell me, yeah yeah)
It's kinda hard for me to figure out
(I gotta know, I gotta know)
I know you're ready to settle down
(If there's a God above, he'd tell us)

Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
(Will I ever fall in love again?)
Or will I be alone forever?
(Oh!)
Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
(Will I ever fall, will I ever fall in love again?)
Or will I be alone forever?

To fall in love
(I would do anything, anything)
To fall in love, to fall in love
(I would do anything)
To fall in love
(I would do anything)
To fall in love, to fall in love I would do anything

Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
Or will I be alone forever?
Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
(I would do anything, anything)
Or will I be alone forever?

Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
Or will I be alone forever?
Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
Or will I be alone forever?
