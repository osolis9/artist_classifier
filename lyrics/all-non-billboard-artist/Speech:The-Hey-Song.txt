The-Hey-Song:Speech
Step into my world for 1 day, just one
To some it be a ridiculous case of boredom.
Too others it be exciting as wild kingdom,
2 Me it be as bumpy as them roads in Brooklyn.
Fayetteville be my base my place to relax
Deep within the bush & barely on the map
Phat things of God around me when I do tracks
And blastin' thru my walls ya hear that ole boom bap
My queen & seed be maxin cuz the chores be taxin
At least one flick a week be our way of relaxin.
Drop off the baby at grams and mellow best. Then take a walk around the lake
to get our brains undressed.
Bare backed cerebrals make for good cathedrals
Ya body be yo temple so its best to keep it simple
Yo I rock this microphone with years of rap in my belt.
My voice clear as digital but with warmth so its felt.
Breath control on point, no darthvader here
So [adjust the bass & treble make my mic sound clear]

Chorus
Heyy

Come to my show, ya know I rocks better live
Hit U with the new, then dig into archives
Speech is big mouth Huge grill much teeth
Been doin nice routines since the age of the drill teams
Now I'm like a wu organization or an Indie nation
On musical levels fit to get wit music festivals
But on the D.L. check the vibe I omit
Cold rock a party wit that funky
