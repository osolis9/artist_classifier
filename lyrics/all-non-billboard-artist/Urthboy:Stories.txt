When i get to you, now i wont forget
what it took n text by the bullet n breaks
by the cradled limb by the state im in, by the skin on my teeth taken on the chin
i was out for it, yeah more than norm
I was down for the cause, and you ought to know
spanner down ...

something like an addiction that i fought to door
got a debt to the stars, debt to the gutter and a debt to the bars
debt for the wisdom that i would discard
yet i would do it in the future as i have in the past
all if it has scarred me but im still here

through the imperfections that intefere
feeling like a beef stole a whole career
when i know let me lend an ear

i had to go about it, write it out and fight it myself
and theres some stories i can tell you
i had to fail had to fall just for what i did well
and theres some stories i can tell you

dont get it twisted doh i dont want to blink and then miss its glow

get your dempsey by the same move
by the time you hear this you already know the future me
nothing you can do for me, sorry you are not who you used to be
whatever you got's news to me what i handed you wasnt handled beautifully
but its done
tainted blood cells of bad ankles

ive been damaged it was substabtial
your bodys a temple, but im a venn
but that could not live life in a stand still
im unapologetic im a park, but by the time you need me its already passed
hope you remember this when you fall apart
if not i wrote down a few reminders

i had to go about it write it out and fight it myself
and theres some stories i can tell you

i had to fail had to fall just for what i did well
and theres some stories i can tell you

you gotta go about it, you gottta write it out, you gotta know about it, you gotta let it out

you gotta go about it, you gottta write it out, you gotta know about it, you gotta let it out

bet it all on the vocal cords, reassure the inlaws

dear lord your girls in safe hands, were making great plans
and we will make sense one day
maybe when im grey, this complained of old age
someone get that grandad down off stage
hey kids, your gramps never drank cool aid
in his own time did it with a few fell greats
but what, whats the story better the redemption
whats the quandrum better the retention
i aint breezin and i aint george benson
i aint protected by the reigned fenston
in my future questions in its current sences
that woud be the same youve been doing for centurys
sorry if you ran into empty wrote this so you knew what i meant

i had to go about it write it out and fight it myself
and theres some stories i can tell you

i had to fail had to fall just for what i did well
and theres some stories i can tell you

i had to go about it write it out and fight it myself
and theres some stories i can tell you

i had to fail had to fall just for what i did well
and theres some stories i can tell you
