Tonight-I-Fell-In-Love-Tokens:Doo Wop
Tonight, tonight I fell in love, I want the stars above
To know tonight I fell in love.
Tonight, I gave my heart away to love that can stay
'Cause tonight I fell in love.

Oh what a wonder, this magic spell I'm under!
This feeling that I feel, is it really real?
My heart beats so fast, I pray that it will last
'Til the end of time.

Dum, doobie dum, woo - oo, doobie, doobie
Dum, doobie dum, woo - oo, doobie, doobie
Dum, doobie dum, woo - oo, tonight I fell in love, woo - oo

Tonight, oh may it last forever, forever and ever.
Yes, tonight I fell in love.
Yes, tonight I fell in love
Yes, tonight I fell in love.
Woooooooo
