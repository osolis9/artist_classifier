Tonight-I-m-Yours:Zane
Ooh, ooh
(I can never do too much)
Yeah, um, I know I been gone for a minute
But tonight, I'm all yours

Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way, turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up
'Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours
(I can never do too much)

Our whole relationship is based on trust
And for you I can never do too much
You kept my secrets and held me down
Plus you stayed loyal when I wasn't around

And I know it wasn't easy, I was never home
Concerts, videos and you was all alone
We spent many nights talkin' on the phone
You started catchin' attitudes, I heard it in yo tone

I used to tell you I'll be back when I could
You think I'd leave my baby girl in the hood
I would never do such thing
I wanna show you what true love means

I'ma put you on a pedestal, love so incredible
Victoria Secrets candy thong so edible
Spiritual, mental not just sexual
I'll deaden all my plans to get next to you

Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way, turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up
'Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours

I made reservations at your favorite spot
Pull up, tip the valet at the parking lot
Got a table by the fireplace, candlelit
Tonight, we gone stick to the manuscript

Start it out with a bottle of Cris, followed by a kiss
I can taste your lip gloss on my lips
So, candy sweet with your bubble gum tongue
The type of stuff that keep a brother straight sprung

And I try to play the tough guy role
And hold back but I'm losing control
When it comes to you I can't explain how it feels
No more games baby, Zane is for real

You been askin' for quality time, now you got it
Anything you want you can have, think about it
I been caught up in the hype so long
Now you never spend your nights alone
'Cause daddy's home

Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way, turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up
'Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours

All the love that you deserve I wanna give
And tonight I'll show you it's for you I feel
Everything I do is for you and I
So baby let's ride

To the fellas, while you're out on the grind
Don't forget about your home front
Spend some time with your lady
Or the next man will

If you don't treat her like a queen
You gone see what I mean
When's the last time you told her how you felt inside
Held her hand and caressed her while you looked in her eyes

Let her know that she's everything you need and more
For you my feelings are pure
And tonight, I'm all yours

Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way, turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up
'Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours

I had some problems
And I didn't know how to solve them
Oh baby, but you were the answer
I'll be giving you all my token
I'm your

Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way, turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up
'Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours
