Writers-Block:Knine
Huh-oh, oeh-oh, yea-eah

Another one, two check,
Another song for the radio.
It hasn't sunk in yet,
But it's about to, get personal.
Last night my life,
She walked out with a suitcase.
Took me by surprise,
And I'm hurting so bad.

Now there's just an empty paper
In a room that broke us up.
I'm running out of melodies
They used to be enough.

I can't write it, I just,
I can't write a note.
I can't write it, I just,
I can't write it.
If I finish this song,
I'll admit that she's gone.
And I won't write it, I just,
I won't write a note.
I won't write it, I just,
I won't write it.
Until my heart unlocks,
I'll have writers block, (oeh)
I'll have writers block...

You used to wait up late,
I said I'd be right home.
I'd even miss our dates,
Cause I was grinding in the studio.
You always gave so much,
I thought I gave it back.
I guess I spend my love,
To live in between you and the track.

Now there's just an empty paper
In a room that broke us up.
I'm running out of melodies
They used to be enough.

I can't write it, I just,
I can't write a note.
I can't write it, I just,
I can't write it.
If I finish this song, (finish this song)
I'll admit that she's gone, (ohh)
And I won't write it, I just,
I won't write a note.
I won't write it, I just,
I won't write it.
Until my heart unlocks,
I'll have writers block,
I'll have writers block...

And first week that I'm flopping,
I'll be on the bottom of the charts.
I need my one inspiration,
The reason that I'm saying.
She is how I got to the top...
I just can't write it.

I can't write it, I just,
I can't write a note.
I can't write it, I just,
I can't write it.
If I finish this song, (finish this song)
I'll admit that she's gone,
And I won't write it, I just, (I won't write it, I won't write it)
I won't write a note.
I won't write it, I just,
I won't write it.
Until my heart unlocks,
I'll have writers block,
I'll have writers block...

Oh, oh-oeh-oeh.
