There's something in the air that's making me so loco
down to my toes
I feel the better motion that's stronger than the ocean
Before I even know it, I'm letting go

Forget all your problems, you don't have to solve them
You just got to live and love
So lets come together, a moment forever
We'll shine like the stars above

Light it up
In the heat of the night
There's a fire in your eyes
I can see it
Light it up
Watch the temperature rise
Raise your hands to the sky
If you feel it

Light it up
In the heat of the night
There's a fire in your eyes
I can see it
Light it up

Woooooo...
Woooooo...

Feel like its getting hot, sweat dripping like a sauna
You should close up your [?] yeah its alright
Cause it's a celebration but every [?]
We got no renovation, nobody mind

Forget all your problems, you don't have to solve them
You just got to live and love
So lets come together, a moment forever
We'll shine like the stars above

Light it up
In the heat of the night
There's a fire in your eyes
I can see it
Light it up
Watch the temperature rise
Raise your hands to the sky
If you feel it

Light it up
In the heat of the night
There's a fire in your eyes
I can see it
Light it up

Woooooo...
Woooooo...
