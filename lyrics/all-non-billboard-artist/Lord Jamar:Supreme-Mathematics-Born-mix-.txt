Supreme-Mathematics-Born-mix-:Lord Jamar
(Lord Jamar)
ONE - One is Knowledge, TWO - Two is Wisdom
THREE - Three is Understanding, the devil's underhanded
FOUR - Four is Culture Freedom, FIVE - Five is Power Refinement
SIX - Six is Equality, newborns follow me
SEVEN - Seven is God, EIGHT - Eight is Build or Destroy
NINE - Nine is Born, you forget to rewind the song
ZERO - Zero is Cipher, now there you have it
And cause I sincerely love Allah's Mathematics

(Chorus 2X: Lord Jamar)
Supreme Mathematics, this ain't black magic
I do my work amongst dope fiends and crack addicts
Civilized the savage, eight five's run rampant
We try'nna save these babies lives, (god damm it)

(Lord Jamar)
Yo, Knowledge is the foundation, of all things in existence
Knowledge is symbolic to the black man
The foundation of his universal fan
Just like the son, in the solar system
Wisdom is the wise words spoken by the wise black man
Who is God, Wisdom is symbolic to the black woman
Secondary, but, most necessary, to bring forth the seed of life
Understanding is the best part, it manifest
The Knowledge and the Wisdom that Allah possess
Also symbolize the black child who rise, like
Cream to the top, and never stop
Culture is your way of life, my way of life is I Self Lord And Master
Freedom is to free the dumb, I see the slums
Full of mental slaves on the way to they graves
They need.

(Chorus 2X)
Aiyo, Power is the Truth, and the Truth is the Light
It take you right out of the dark and give you sight
Refinement is to cleanse yourself, mentally and physically
For so much not done typically, Equality is to be Equal
In all forms of Knowledge, to share with my people
God is Allah, and Allah is God
Is what was told to Muhammad by Master Farrad, come on

(Chorus 2X)

(Lord Jamar)
Aiyo, Build is to add on, to all that's positive
Destroy is take away all that's negative
Born is bring into existence
That can only happen if there's persistance
I was Born twice, first through my moms
Then through the womb of Islam
Born is be complete, cause after that
All numbers repeat, just add the zero
Cipher is a circle, three hundred sixty degrees
Knowledge 120, Wisdom 120, Understanding 120
A Cipher is a person, place or thing
My blood line trace back to kings
A Cipher is a person, place or thing
My blood line trace back to kings
Now do the Math...
