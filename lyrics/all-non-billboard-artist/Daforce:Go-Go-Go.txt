Walk up in the spot, ladys look hot, music gonna pop, The bars getting rocked âˆ§ we aint gone stop till 3 hits clock, R & B, reggae, cylpso and hip hop so shake what u want, shake what you got, I dont buy quickly i was taught to shop, your stock has dropped and ive seen your goods, and a flops a flop.
