Flesh-Bone:Shontelle
Yeah, listen carefully
Listen to these words

Baby take a minute let me sit you down
Been waiting for the time and the time is now
I think you should decide where you wanna be
Running in the streets or living here with me

Baby take a step back and look around
Gonna run yourself like you do the ground
You're not invincible and the fact is
Nothing's guaranteed but the darn taxes

[Incomprehensible]
Boy you better listen for you're all alone
When the money's spent and all your friends are gone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone, flesh and bone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone

Hear me now

Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
Is there any hope that you could ever be
More than just a fish in the sea?
'Cause baby after all if you get cut you're gonna bleed

Try to understand what I'm telling you
This is not a game don't you play the fool
I'm begging won't you hear my plea?
This is not a theory it's reality

[Incomprehensible]
Boy you better listen for you're all alone
When the money's spent and all your friends are gone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone, flesh and bone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone
Then you're gonna realize

Living in this cold world never easy
Life ain't no sweet bread, that's what my momma told me
I'm getting wise and now I see what she mean
You need to settle down and stop living so extreme

I'm your woman and you know I'll always love you
I'll never do a single thing to exploit you
Life is so precious never take it for granted
How can I make you understand this baby?

[Incomprehensible]
Boy you better listen for you're all alone
When the money's spent and all your friends are gone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone, flesh and bone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone
You're only flesh and bone, flesh and bone, flesh and bone

When you're in, when you're out
Boy you're gonna learn what it's all about
When you're up, when you're down
Who be there to lift you off the ground now?

When you're high, when you're low
One thing in life you're surely gonna know
Easy come, easy go
In the end you're only flesh and bone

[Incomprehensible]
Boy, you better listen for you're all alone
When the money's spent and all your friends are gone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone, flesh and bone
Then you're gonna realize you're only flesh and bone
