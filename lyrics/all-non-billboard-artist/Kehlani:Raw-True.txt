Raw-True:Kehlani
"Raw & True"

I am not looking for someone to buy my loving
Don't spend no money on me boy I don't need nothing
And I hope you know
And don't take it personal
When I say
That you're acting cliche

Anyone can buy me anything
And any man can buy me
Any gold, some cars, a ring
Is it that bad of an idea to love for love instead of money
Forced to realize that there's nothing wrong with love like honey

Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Stop looking down at your wallet
I'm trying to see your eyes
Not one gift in this world could make me feel more than I already do
All I need is for your love to be raw and true

I'm not gonna model us after the couples on the websites
Acting like they're in love for the fan's likes
Please
I just wanna know your soul
I am trying to discover your likes and your dislikes, your middle name, do you like starlight?
Baby, just let me explore you
And I'm not trying to hurt you
By not accepting the things you wanna do
I'm just trying to show you
That I'm in it with my heart
We could be dead broke as long as we're together
I'm not leaving you, no matter the weather
Cause I might be in love with you

Anyone can buy me anything
And I said any man can buy me
Any clothes, a car, a ring
Is it that bad of an idea to love for love instead of money
Forced to realize that there's nothing wrong with love like honey

Don't be scared
Don't be shy
Stop looking down at your wallet
I'm trying to see your eyes
Not one gift in this world could make me feel more than I already do
All I need is for your love to be raw and true
