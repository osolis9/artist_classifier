Walk-A-Poem-to-My-Fans-:Tyrese
Forgive me 
'Cause I come to you more than I give thanks 
Why am I on my knees prayin' yet again 
Asking for more and more and more 
Without recognizing the blessings I've already received 
So now I say to you Father God thank you 
People are inspired by your transparency 
Your walk is way more inspiring than your talk of God 
Walk 

I ask God for clarity so that He can reveal things to you that you will 
Never be able to see with your own eyes, pray for clarity
Walk
God will never give you something somebody else is supposed to have 
So your jealousy your envy and insecurities about somebody else's blessings 
Shouldn't be because it ain't yours 
Walk 
I bet everything on my wedding ring 
I'm married to God so therefore our marriage is work in progress
Walk 
Faith is climbing invisible stairs 
I pray that God blesses me to find comfort in discomfort 
Give me the strength to walk unto the unfamiliar 
You should always expect the things that you accept from people 
If I accept your disrespect then it's expected of you to continue
Walk 
If I make you uncomfortable with my bottom line don't cross it 
You can often tell how far your life and career will go 
Based on the five people you spend the most time 
So therefore I am a direct reflection of my surroundings 
Yes, walk 
I used to be in fear of people saying Tyrese you've changed 
Well, actually I have 

Walk with me, walk with me, walk with me ooh 
Walk with me, walk with me, walk with me ooh 
Walk with me, walk with me, walk with me ooh 
Ooh, walk with me, walk with me ooh
