Intensify my thoughts of homicide can't live this life
Gotta stick one in your dick skinnin you alive
But ain't no time to find a weakness in me
Set you on fire murda and don't bring no mercy with me
So you could die and burn up
And me and my alibis gonna watch you die gettin high
Should of told your mamma get your casket ready left to lie

[Chorus]
