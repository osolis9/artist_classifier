Would you take me out for dancing?
Dancing on the floor
I'll be out in Rio
Dancing at the disco
Girls'd be lookin' sexy
Dressin' mighty fine
Baby dancing funky
Happening start the good time (?)

I'll be steppin out
To paint the town
And party the night away
I'll be dancin'
I'll be groovin'

And I'm gonna do it
Because the drummer make me do it
Make me do it to the way that he play

Would you take me to the party
Party with the world
Dancing in the ghetto
Knowing not the jealous (?)
Come on everybody
Won't you feel the joy
Music is the potion
Travellin' from coast to coast in

I'll be steppin' out around the world
Washing the pain away
You'll be dancin
You'll be groovin'

And you will do it
because the drummer make you do it
make you do it to the way that he play
