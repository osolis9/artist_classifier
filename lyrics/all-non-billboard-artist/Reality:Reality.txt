Reality:Reality
Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, a times where we should know
I can't fly high, I can't go long
Today I got a million. Tomorrow, I don't know

Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, a times where we should know
I can't fly high, I can't go long
Today I got a million. Tomorrow, I don't know

Stop crying like you're home and think about the show
We're all playing the same game, I'm laying down along
We're unknown and wrong, special when I come

Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow
Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall

Dancing in the moonlight, don't we have it all?
