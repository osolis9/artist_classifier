Do you remember me?
I feel so small
Are you listening
tonight?
So temporary
The things that I have seen
I ran so far
Will you take me back again?
Entertaining angels
By the light of my TV screen
24-7 you wait for me
Entertaining angels
By the time I fall to my knees
Host of heaven, sing over me

One to another
The feelings in between
I won't let go
Of all you taught me
Alright
Close as a brother
The way we used to be
I'll hold my breath
And wait for you to breathe
Entertaining angels
By the light of my TV screen
24-7 you wait for me
Entertaining angels
While the night becomes history
Host of heaven, sing over me
Entertaining angels
By the light of my TV screen
24-7 you wait for me
Entertaining angels
By the time I fall to my knees
Host of heaven, sing over me

Well, just a day in the shoes of a color blind man
Should make it easy for you to see
That these diverse tones do more than cover our bones
As a part of our anatomy
Entertaining angels
By the light of my TV screen
24-7 you wait for me
(We're colored people, and they call us the human race)
Entertaining angels
By the time I fall to my knees
Host of heaven, sing over me
(... colored people who depend on a holy grace)
Entertaining angels
By the light of my TV screen
24-7 you wait for me.
