Please-Use-This-Song:Jon Lajoie
Please use this song in your commercial I need the money, so please use this to sell something
Please use this song in your commercial

A fast food franchise, office supplies
A brand new hair dye, a dating website
A suicide hotline, a new way to exercise
A preview for a movie that is coming out in July
A political campaign, a new video game
A medication that you didn't know you should be taking
Any product any service this is the right song
Your target audience will be singing and dancing along

Please use this song in your commercial I need the exposure, my house is in foreclosure
So please use this song in your commercial

Oh to have a song in a national campaign
Millions would hear my song and they would say
"Have you seen that commercial?
You know the one about that thing?
The song playing in the background is really great!"

A credit card company, join the military
A new way to make yourself less hairy
Life insurance, medical insurance
Cat insurance, insurance insurance
Financial institution, the one that took my house
If you use this song maybe we can work something out
Any product any service this is the right song
Your target audience will be singing and dancing along

Please use this song in your commercial The music industry's dying, but consumerism is thriving
So please use this song in your commercial
