[Intro: Phonte]
(To the left, take it back y’all now)
(To the left, take it back y’all now)
(To the left, take it back y’all now)
(To the left, take it back y’all now)

[Verse 1: Phonte]
One night on the scene, and they can see you
Living like a star
New Playboy fatigue, they don’t believe that
It’s tearing you apart
[Pre-Hook: Phonte]
All I really want
Is just a night at home with her by candlelight
But until I find that girl
I’m gonna hit the floor and we gon' jam tonight
Just can’t settle down not right now

[Hook: Phonte]
What you need and what you like
Drinks and girls of every type
I had one too many, I had one too many
Sexy girls and city lights
Planes and transatlantic flights
I had one too many, I had one too many, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Phonte]
One night on the scene, and I can see you
Moving in the dark
I don’t want to leave and can’t pretend to
Cause it’s not in my heart

[Pre-Hook: Phonte]
All I really want
Is just a night at home with her by candlelight (quiet time, quiet time)
But until I find that girl
I’m gonna hit the floor and we gon' jam tonight
Want to settle down, not right now

[Hook: Phonte]

Drinks and girls of any type

Planes and transatlantic flights
I had one too many, I had one too many

[Interlude: Phonte]
I had one too many, I had one too many
I had one too many, I had one too many
I had one too many, I had one too many
I had one too many, I had one too many

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Breaking down your defenses
In my arms, yes, you’re defenseless
Like you in court with a public defendant
Star witness wanna sing?
But if you on the team, we gon' swing for the fences
When it’s go time on that goal line, shit
I be making the call, just gimme the ball, I’ll get you the inches
Broads my age talkin' marriage and babies
And I’m like been there done it, boss
The young gals wanna love me long time
But then you gotta listen to ‘em talk
Talking me, me, me like she 'bout to sing a cappella on the steps of City Hall
Some set the bar, some raise the bar
I’ve passed the bar, lemme get you off

[Outro: Phonte]
I had one too many
I had one too many
I had one too many
I had one too many
