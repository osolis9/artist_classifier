Little bird
Of all the things I find in life
No moments better than this
Of all the things I didn't know
Nothing prepared me for you're kiss
If we fly...
If we fly...
If we fly into the sun
Of all the things I needed baby
You were my cherished one
Little bird told me, that you can't find you're way home
Little bird has showed me, that you can't run away from love
Darkness falls upon the city
Like the ocean falls upon the sand
Waves of sorrow leave me breathless
Can you love this broken man
If I try.
If I try...
If I try to love again
I wake up every morning, unsure of where I stand
Little bird told me, that you can't find you're way home
Little bird has showed me, that you can't run away from love
Open wide my feelings and tear me down until I break
Show me what the real is
Guaranteed to seal faith
If I fly
If I cry
If I cry when you'll be gone
Help me by my sadness tell me I am the only one
Only...
Only...
Only...
Angel
Hold me...
Hold me...
Hold me...
Angel
Love is only givin' when you feel it in you're heart
I know it when you, kiss my body, loving every part
Of all the thing I find in life, no moments better than this
Of all the things I ever knew, nothing prepared me for you're kiss
If we fly
If we fly
If we fly in to the sun
Of all the things I needed baby
You were my cherished one
Little bird told me, that you can't find you're way home
Little bird has showed me that you can't run away from love
