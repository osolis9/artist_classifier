Eyes-Wide-Shut:Muphin
I've got my eyes wide shut, shut
Too scared to open them up, up
And I don't know who to trust, trust
That's why I keep my eyes shut, shut
And I'm tired of being so predictable
Knowing how I'd respond to situations brought forth by a single individual
Typical with my signature mockeries and ridicules
My philosophy's based around what's visible to my own eyes
Knowing myself so well till I'm left blind
By the repetition of time, the signs of stubbornness
The rubble gets in the way of my views
And I could only see myself from the inside
Curious about looking at myself from your point of views
I really do have my eyes wide shut
And I'll be screaming silently to myself to shut the fuck up
Muph is but not enough to conquer the corrupt stuff
That snuck passed on a watered down footpath
Staring at a mirror through a mask
Supposed to be the first to understand me but I'll probably be the last
But I'll laugh after the aftermath of that A-class confusion
Losing clarity, all illusions
Now can it be that? Can it be that?
Built from moral bricks, my wall stood tall
Till you all flashed a light through it
Blew it with a slow motion tumble and fall
And I don't recall requesting these informative flashes
Images projected and I inspected the graphics
The lies behind the world and the truth behind the magic
Threw me into an immediate panic, havoc to my isolated space
Changed the face of my own hidden place
No fear or prejudice against any race, we are all equal
But these evil people backtrack to the medieval
And speak through hate, power, spite and the deceitful
The government's holding the world to be conceivable
Controlling the media to make it so believable
But holding back all sides of the story
And so this wall stood before me
Guns, violence and slaughter, how are they connected to the glory?
The lies bore me and the tide poured the refreshing salt water
On my bare feet, vegetables to eat
So why am I chewing on the beef?
Maybe the truth wasn't meant to be a sneak peak
And mentally eventually I'll fill the niche, retreat
And continue to speak so much bullshit
With my eyes wide shut, shut
