Great-Expectations:Diggy Simmons
[** feat. Bei Maejor:]


Yeah, I'm ready, yeah*

They wan't me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No one let them break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready)

All the stares
And all the glares
They waitin' on him
And all the weight
From all the hate
It's gainin' on him
The intensity as he rises
As nobody can disguise it
It's like he got fire in his eyelids
The crowd is roarin'
It's so enormous, his blood is boilin'
His head is burnin', he's focus
He wishes they ignore 'em
Who in they right mind
Want to let his light shine
He ain't even in his prime
Pressure of a lifetime
He standing steady, head sweaty
Maybe nervous, but ready
The skepticism lies heavy
He's bout to make it ready
He got his fam on his back
Bout to carry like Chevy
So much on his plate
He hopes the repercussion?s ain't deadly
But he ain't gonna back out or what
He faces right now and he
Knows that he will outstand every
Doubt and turn around
The inceptions are knocked out
They are no longer will be doubt
There's a rumor he won't stop till his name is what they shout

They wan't me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No I won't let them break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready)

He's no longer fearing
That's why the past [?] persevering
The way he's staring is clearing
All that could be competition immediately tuition
He's burnin, he's never slippin'
And been hearing him say that now he could be the best that ever did it
Their expectations lie
So we just bringin' can I
Be the best man I can ever be to exceed everything they want me to be
No anxiety, just gonna do me and no [?] for the ones to believe
Video name is dedicated with a protection to achieve
So Ima keep going, keep going, keep knowing
I'm the dopiest around my point but Imma need you to know it
I know where I came from but I stay so honest and focus
Like I was focusin and wasn't million in one of the closest
Great expectations I got em waiting and anticipatin
They only [?] you know [?]
I'm returnin' to be one of the greatest
So if you hate it take it cause I won't stop and you wanna make it

They wan't me to fall
They wanna see if I make it
Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky
No I won't let them break me
I got great expectations
Great expectations
(I'm ready, I'm ready)

Staring in the heaven with my headphones on
I can see it in my eyes and know
That I'm the one they have been waiting for
I know my dreams are waiting for me
And looking down into way to go, noooo

I tell em screamin' my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game, yeah [x3]
I tell em screamin' my name, yeah [x2]
I ain't gonna give up the game [x3]
