Four-Magicians:Insane
Heaven is seized by legions of hell
Sinful desciples raging undead
Rotting obscene in the realm of death
Witches that dance in the night

Moonlight tyranny four shadows unnamed
Come for the upset mind of you all
Restless nightmare corrupts your brain
The evil wisdom unfolds

Maniac wizards live
Idle eyes and blood
Under the spell
Killers with no soul

Inplore and you'll be spared to follow us blind
Lost in a madness that endlessy glides
The morbid worship renders you numb
Soon you are going to be dried

Black sons of hell born from a graveyard
Waste the world at every foot step
Decayed children entreat the end
Satanas is biting our hands

Black magic lords
Face the wrath we bring
Evil makes us be
As long as we kill

SOLO

Maniac wizards live
Idle eyes and blood
Under the spell
Killers with no souk
Black magic lords
Face the wrath we bring
Evil makes us be
As long as we kill
