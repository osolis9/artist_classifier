Keep-It-Real:Young Bleed
Yeah, uh, my boy Young Bleed in here
C-Loc in here, an' you know the
Colonel MP up in here

Nigga we gonna keep it real dawg
Hustiln' high, 'cuz live niggas keep it real
Young, can we keep it real Loc?
Tryin' not to spill no blood
If it's real show a nigga love, nigga

Nigga it burns for gold that rose before me
That was fakin' the funk, long an' behold I come to get it
So I'm takin' it in chunks, out to lunch for brunch
Maggots gonna munch in perpendicular, order money, man slaughter

I write this shit that's good for you
How many mutha fuckas must get dealt wit'?
Before someone kick down yo door, an' leave you helpless
Is you feelin' my fear, feelin' my vibe, at the same time

I dirty my theory, clickin' my tribe, tryin' ta claim mine
Hush, what you discovered don't shake the rector
My nigga, my nerve, go get the camera, get the picture
I'm laughin' at y'all for tryin' to ball, wit' yo mug on me

Movin' a million mutha fuckas strappin' murder machine
I come dainty an benidine, so gimme mine, sippin' great wine
Polishin' pussy that's genuine, paralyzed to the format
Still smokin' blunts for days

An' mama's theories an' ways, got me prepared ha
Niggas ain't ready but if it wasn't for the grace of God
They say you couldn't live life against all odds
I know it's hard but it's real though
I'm 'bout to peel out, every time I touch somethin'
What ya feel yo, nigga, give a fuck if you bigga

Nigga we gonna keep it real dawg
Hustiln' high, 'cuz live niggas keep it real
Young, can we keep it real Loc?
Tryin' not to spill no blood
If it's real show a nigga love, nigga

It be a piper push pounds, wit' playas who wanna rise
Pick the pen then my rhyme, eh
So now I can make a legal paper in this rap game
At the first used to hear that boy playin' wit' steel toys

Now I'm worse, can't break the curse, y'all laugh until I die
Comin' from the dirt, so watch a young hustler rise an shine
Like the ghetto mastermind, let 'em know, why do
('Bout it, 'bout it)
Doin' all that lyin' got the nation down to Young mutha fucka ain't do shit, can't stand the heat
Get out the kitchen, before trigga fingas get to itchin'
Get up, get into position to have twitchin', thinkin', damn
How could I have mention, stop trippin', keep it real nigga

Nigga we gonna keep it real dawg
Hustiln' high, 'cuz live niggas keep it real
Young, can we keep it real Loc?
Tryin' not to spill no blood
If it's real show a nigga love, nigga

Nigga we gonna keep it real dawg
Hustiln' high, 'cuz live niggas keep it real
Young, can we keep it real Loc?
Tryin' not to spill no blood
If it's real show a nigga love, nigga

Uh, I live my life of a youngsta wit' money
Too many, bitches panhandlers, beggas an dummies
Tryin' to, steal my soul, I mean suck me dry
For these 20 inch rims on my ghetto ride

I couldn't lose my life tryin' to keep my shoes
Sell my soul to the devil, in the ghetto you lose
An' ain't no, nigga gonna make it, fakin' the game
Too many blacks behind bars for fortune and fame

I live, my life, readin' jail house letters, I'm workin'
Money orders sendin' weed through sweaters
I seen mama's turn off of hustlas and killas
My last supper probably gonna be wit' fiends an' dealers, uh

Nigga we gonna keep it real dawg
Hustiln' high, 'cuz live niggas keep it real
Young, can we keep it real Loc?
Tryin' not to spill no blood
If it's real show a nigga love, nigga
