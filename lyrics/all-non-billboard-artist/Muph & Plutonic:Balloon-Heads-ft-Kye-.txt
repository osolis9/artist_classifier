Balloon-Heads-ft-Kye-:Muph & Plutonic
feat. Kye
Let's pop these balloons, one by one
They got a head full of helium, floatin to the sun
Make it pop, make it pop, these fools are so overrated
Bring 'em back down to earth and see their egos deflated
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, oh...

Let's pop these balloons, one by one
Got a rock and a slingshot, I don't need a gun
It's time we burst these bubbles for what they've become
Too good for here an' now, they want the clouds, let 'em run
Once upon a time, they'd hang at your level
Floating by our sides, they seemed so settled
Head was a regular size, now it's incredible
How mammoth it actually got, so drop little bastard
Watch the rock just knocking on your heartstrings
And you lost it in the fast winds
No option but to harm him, so common it's alarming
No calming before the storm, you're sure to be torn
Conform to the outburst, what goes up will be falling boy
That's just how it works out in the outer burbs
Now it first starts off as just confidence
I'm all for that but keep it in tact, you overreact to the compliments
The problem is you let the nonsense go to your head
And as you float to the sun, you a approach a lonely death

Drifting so high up above
Got a head full of helium, neck full of drugs
As if you weren't already cool enough
Now you gotta go ahead and try to pull my plug
I use this as a rule of thumb
If I think I'm better than them, I'm the foolish one
They didn't even need to pull a punch
Cause you don't even know what stupids done
You're making me dizzy, busy tryna move to the sun
You flew with nuns over the rooftop
I'ma take it back to the days of roof rocks
You're too hot, two pot screamer, spaced out
Head in the clouds, your proud face play it down
Safe and sound so I hope you found the thunder
Even if we're drowned in the sun all summer
You will deflate and awake in the grate of a gutter

Pop!
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, oh...
