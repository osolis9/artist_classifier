And they ain't stopping, til there pussy poppin
And I'm not stopping, til I get them bobbing
Maaannnnnnn I just want some hear,

Don't get me wrong I'd love to have sex, 
But I'd rather blow a load all over your face and neck
Dripping to your breast to relieve all my stress.
You'll get curressed after you get undressed

Take a hit of this dro, then suck on my pole

If your stressing cause an ex dont mess with me, 
But if your tripping on some x, sit next to me.

And yes i confess you look HOT in that dress 
So why settle for less, you deserve the best
Lets make your hair a mess, and get you wet!!
