Here-We-Go-Sing-Along-Instrumental:Ali Dee
Be heard, Be strong, Be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, Come on, Be loud
We're gonna raise our voice
Come on, Come on, Come on
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
Hey now
We no longer wait around
My team stronger than weights now
Keeps on growing
Our muscles keeps on showing
We came here to make a change
We came here to rearrange
We came here cause we believe
We came here cause we achieve, yeah
While I've got the microphone
Make sure how i feel is known
All for one we rock the zone
How I feel to each his own
All my people treat' em right
We reserve the right to fight
For what we want, for what we need
To the front we shall proceed
Here we come and we're ready to
go, go, go
Better run cause we don't take
no, no, no
So come on
Be heard, Be strong, Be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, Come on, Be loud
We're gonna raise our voice
Come on, Come on, Come on
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
We're motivated
We're aggravated
We're dedicated
So now you better play fair
determination (and) will power
With consideration
we will devour
We're on our own
But we are one
Shoulder to shoulder we'll fight until
we see the sun
It's just a matter of time
Before you see our way
We fight with all of our lives
We do this everyday
Here we come and we're ready to
go, go, go
Better run cause we don't take
no, no, no
So come on
Be heard, Be strong, Be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, Come on, Be loud
We're gonna raise our voice
Come on, Come on, Come on
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
