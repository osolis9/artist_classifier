Get-Off-It:Casual
Ha, you know what I'm sayin'
Hieroglyphics in here forever
Ha, ha

Aiyyo, peep it, the back breakin' mack takin' titles
Vital to the right I'll make men ache when
They try to step, but Charlatans are within
The range of danger, which keeps me callin'

Friends I meets more fake fools than real ones
But it takes clues and hits to make moves with sense
And since I'm a rhymer, I need to take time to
Give niggaz reminders

Who's the best? Confuse the rest
Abuse crews with the news they paid dues to my death
The defter, slept on, long enough
So now I pissed the stronger stuff and break out a bomb to puff

Wrong, you can't hit, I lit it
Get it, nope, because you, counterfeited, dope
I hate fake guys and you make eyes follow with you
Hollow tips through your hand, you're left dead

Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know, I know you know

Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know, I know you know

Hip, hip, hooray, dip skip away from the forte
Of freshness nuff skills impresses the West is
All up to my ingenuity, you will be
Comparing, to the rare men, we're aware when

Daring situations get your face in
Your crew's areas, so you move gregarious
Whenever you rhyme you do shit that's putrid
And noisome so why voice 'em, crew's get

Beaten until inanity, Hieroglyphics can it be
We're the best in the planet G wiz niggaz are jealous
But I fight what you bend with teeth
So you can see if you can dig the G R O O V E S
'Cause we be fresh for cypher a few the sneakiest

When kids wanna fade me, great
But behold I got Seoul like the Olympics in eighty-eight
So ladies wait for the coming of the He-Men
You're on my nuts or that's how it's semen

The mastermind is never apprehended
I screw the ruler to fool the joker, and going up
Like the smoke of a phattie, add me to the shit list
'Cause I be that, I know you see that

We phat, livin' larger than life
I be the Zenith, clean with mean stuff
Taking charge of the stifling, oppressing the dopest in the sector
Respect the dope rhyme wrecker

Hope I'm clingin', when you think you're seein'
A massy Josh B got the beat like Rodney
So King me 'cuz I jumped ya, this is how I checkah, foe
Hit even the pecker, yo, getting to respect the bro
L I F N I C, you now know

Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know, I know you know

Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know I know you're on it
Get off it, I know you know, I know you know
