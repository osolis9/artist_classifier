Hunting-the-Midnight-Sun:Caffeine
here i am about to leave out of your life
never told a soul what i have planned
but my twisted hands kept coming back to you

you're like a cigarette,
your addictive love I just can't quit
The colors of your eyes,
your hands holding mine
I just can't forget,
the best things in my life
Why would I let go of someone
who is going to keep me?

When the sun dies out
will you be the light?
when my heart beat stops
will you be my life?
If I leave you here
will you wait for me?
'til i'm old and gray
do you promise to stay

Am I still worth your love?
Am I worth my weight in gold?
I'm scared of what the future holds
Blinded by my visions,
is it still you that I am dreaming of?
Are you going to be the anchor
of a ship that is sailing?

If I leave you here
will you wait for me?
'til i'm old and gray
do you promise to stay?
But if my walls cave in
Would you find a way?
If i'd burnt bridges
will you be ok?
please don't fade away

when the sun dies
out
