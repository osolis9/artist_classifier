All-the-Roads:Pigeon John
All the lights shine brighter out in Hollywood
Get her in my Coupe de Ville, yeah, I probably could.
But in the morning when the sun's up,
She gonna wanna know what's real.
See, I've been known to take a drink or two while out
Doing anything in front of me and pass out.
I come around and wake up slowly,
I already know the deal, what's real!

I've been blind and wasted in all different places
Racing towards something new.
It don't matter where you face it,
All the roads lead back to you.
I've been rolled like a boulder into a soldier,
Stood on his shoulders too.
It don't matter where you face it,
All the roads lead back to you.

I've been around the world and fought with the best of them
Saw disciples sing a whole new testament.
I run away and see the same face,
I know that my fate is sealed.
She said, I wanna know the truth, if I'm the only one!
I turn around and lie to her in the morning sun.
But every seed I plant on me,
Is gonna reap an empty field
What's real!

I've been blind and wasted in all different places
Racing towards something new.
It don't matter where you face it,
All the roads lead back to you.
I've been rolled like a boulder into a soldier,
Stood on his shoulders too.
It don't matter where you face it,
All the roads lead back to you,
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I keep on going back
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I keep on going back
Back to you, back to you, back to you

I've been blind and wasted in all different places
Racing to something new.
It don't matter where you face it,
All the roads lead back to you.
I've been rolled like a boulder into a soldier,
Stood on his shoulders too.
It don't matter where your face it,
All the roads lead back to you. End
