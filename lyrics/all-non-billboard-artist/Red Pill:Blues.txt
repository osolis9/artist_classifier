Blues:Red Pill
Now I only smile on Fridays
The lights turned off
The fan is on for comfort
But i lie awake (lie awake)
Her next to me is lovely
She was nice enough to fuck me
Before we went to bed
And now my body's feeling warm and comfy
My mind is on some "What the fuck is going on?" (Going on)
I'm 25 without a basis yet to grow on
No foundation
Feel like a newborn on the ground naked
Tears flowing
Mouth open like screaming but no sound making
And do I sound crazy?
Probably not because we all feel the same
We all feel that pain
We all drink and smoke and fuck too much
To numb the chase of money
Bunch of fucking dummies
We all heal the same
But god damn it we all wake up like
"Today will be the day I change"
Knowing motherfucking well tomorrow it will be the same
I feel like this is all I write about
Depression is perpetual
I feel my life and write it down

Feeling trapped in my head
So I wake up on some late night shit
Feeling trapped in my bed
Trying to quit smoking with those blues
But my friend he left a pack of Reds
Walked past the E-Cig and grabbed the pack instead
I grabbed the lighter off the coffee table
Somebody left the TV on
So I turned off the cable
Something about that late night feeling
Had me feeling lost, unstable
Put on my Vans
Grab my hat
To cover my dumb-ass hair
Then I walked down those stairs and
Out the door and to the porch of my complex
Thinking I'm poor
But I'm complex
I lit my cigarette
I'm feeling alone
I'm feeling happy about forgetting my phone
Some days I'm on this shit like it's real life
Some days I forget my humanity
What it feels like
And down the street I see this drunk ass
I'm thinking, "please walk past, man
Don't even ask" (even ask)

'Hey man can I bum a smoke?'

So, I gave that bum a smoke
And then he asked me for my lighter
For my fire
Now this is where I get inspired because
He said, 'I'm sorry
All I brought was my habit'
Profound words of an addict

Because all I came to this Earth with
Was a habit and no purpose But I'm going to die with a smile on my face
Either looking back
Or looking forward
Let's hope that it's the former
