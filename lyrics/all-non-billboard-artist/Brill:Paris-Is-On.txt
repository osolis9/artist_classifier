Paris-Is-On:Brill
It's been almost seven hours without a sign
And the dust from ruined cornfields caught in my eyes
And my mind is empty and my heart is pure
I have learned to forget
I have suffered these fools

Paris is open
Paris is I see you, you're alone

I see burning flames from oil wells and factories
And the desert night is a rusted and stained painting
See the dead insects on my windshield
Think, "Maybe now our souls will be free."

Paris is up
Paris is open
Paris is I need you like the sun
Paris is on, Paris is on

Paris is on
Paris is anxious
Paris is I see you, you're an easy mark

I'm so tired of these freaks and their violent streaks
As they pound on their chests with their fists and their feet
I lay quiet and watch their murderous heat
Felt the hate in my heart, wish them dead in the street
Now I'm distant, dark in this anthrobeat
I have suffered the winds of these idiots

Paris is on, Paris is on

Paris is on
Paris is ancient
Paris is I need you 'cause you're all I've got
