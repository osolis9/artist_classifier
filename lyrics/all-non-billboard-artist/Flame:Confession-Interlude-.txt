How the fuck would you feel if you had to share every meal, every night with your foster brothers and sisters, I think about my mom and I missed her, nights after watching the A-Team when I kissed her. I used to want to be Mr. T or Murdoc, which one was it uhhh, than I heard shots, it was coming from a 133rd block, where them Westside piru niggas birds pop, and the crips ain't far way you got nothing block gray streets in the PJ's when niggas 15 years old with beards like freeway and you can die over he say and she say. Like your cousin told my brothers baby mama that game did started that drama in the projects, yeah the same one that they said carmello got robbed at, but I talked to him he said it didn't happen, nigga you play ball, I be the rapper. I don't give a fuck about nba ass niggas (fuck em') anyway nigga, I aint make it nigga I play ball, nigga im jealous nigga. You don't play for the lakers anyway.
