Walk-Away:Wiley
[Verse 1: Wiley]
You can see beef from a mile away if you're looking
You could be strong or weak, don't matter, you might not see what's cooking
I learnt the hard way, me and Kerwin getting stabbed at a booking
And yeah, we fought to the end, me and him against 25 man, no shook ting
All over a Liverpool war, [?] why you wanna be a badman?
I swear your beef ain't mine but certain man, they wanna talk and add man
So how am I gonna win this war when my boy's tryna call nine man more?
OK, two cars, I get outnumbered too fast, [?] numbers, who's fast?

[Hook: Sinead Harnett]
Is there more to life than status and competing for the top?
Is it all just reputation, all the power that you got?
What are we fighting for? Where will the line be drawn?
Before it's too late, just walk away, walk away, walk away
[Verse 2: Wiley]
If nobody backs down, then one of us are gonna die sooner
And it's way too late cause nobody from any ends accepts any ruler
We all wanna be our own bosses, controlling the [?], while others enrol in uni
I respect them cause education is the key, really and truly
I wish I didn't get involved in a final stabbing, could've avoided it, left them hanging
In my life, I don't need no more fakers or non-believers, have it
I prayed they'd change and they did, no more gun or knife in a crib
I'm free, all I gotta do is be me, all I gotta do is be me

[Bridge: Wiley]
In a hospital bed where I'm lying
Ain't sure if I'm dying
In a hospital bed where I'm lying
Ain't sure if I'm dying
In a hospital bed where I lie
It's possible I could die
In a hospital bed where I lie
It's possible I could die
