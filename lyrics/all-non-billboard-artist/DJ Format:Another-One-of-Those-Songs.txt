Another-One-of-Those-Songs:DJ Format
It's time to start shit,
roll out the carpet and turn up the stereo,
Ladies and gents I'm proud to present the finest in sound and flow,
The capital D hyphen S I S I V E F O R M A T
On the Beat... Servin' up hot shit for y'all to rock with and it don't stop till we fall apart,

I try to stay away from a dope beat, 'coz every dope beat I've known I've been forced to headbutt it 'till it's nose bleeds,
Like Steven Seagal in a pool hall with a pool ball in a sock fighting dope fiends,
Breaking arms with my own two palms,
And spit cold flows till my head to my toes freeze,
Shit rappers stick needles into both knees, and try to rob my mojo to clone me,
I own a flow so mean, I could send the hardest rapper running home, in soiled briefs,
So don't provoke me to kick ass or you'll watch the rest of the show crying, clutching torn cheeks,
Here's a warning, I spit harder than waking up after a porn dream, at fourteen,
I'm so fresh and so clean, y'all could serve a four course meal to royalty on my corned feet

I haven't heard one in so long, so
Somebody please tell the disc jock to
Turn the volume up just a little bit,
Where the MC thinks he's so hot,
And makes us say 'HO' wavin' both arms, so
Somebody please tell the disc jock to
Turn the volume up just + Show with every new song,
Got you and your mom screaming 'YOU ROCK!' at your boom-box,
Moshing on your living room floor, raising two palms, and stage-diving off your boob-tubes top,
Like Tom Cruise in a dress shirt and tube-socks,
And yelling 'BO!' like the strings in my shoes' knots,
In a frenzy, eyeballs bulging,
Like seeing MJ introduce the moonwalk,
Makin' disc jocks give my old records a resurrection,
Like Tupac's new doc,
So don't hate coz your crews flopped,
I got nothin' you can hold, you're a figure-skaters tube-top,
I got a buzz like a crew cut,
that gets listeners hyped when my tune drops,
and makes large crowds jump like balloon pops,
And trust me, it ain't the first time like a used...

I haven't heard one in so long, so
Somebody please tell the disc jock to
Turn the volume up just a little bit,
Where the MC thinks he's so hot,
And makes us say 'HO' wavin' both arms, so
Somebody please tell the disc jock to
Turn the volume up just a little bit...
