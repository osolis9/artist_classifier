[ VERSE 1: Al Skratch ]

Uptown, summer in the city85 degrees and the girls are lookin pretty
Yo, check it as I wreck it
I love the summertime, that's when fine girls get naked
I slide in my ride and let my drop-top down
Pump up my block, stopped by a cop clown
On my corner, now what he wanna do? Hold me up for a few cause my car is brand-new
Ran through one light? Not did I ever
I'm just makin money, ain't nothin funny, it's sunny as the weather
Since I'm in the right not the wrong, check it
They go oop-oop, move along, be gone
So I do, as I search for my crew
We got a job to do at the barbecue
By the swimming pool makin women drool as I kick it
I'm drinkin and I'm thinkin I'm addicted
But to which one honey bun wanna get done
Layin in the sun sippin rum havin fun
Come one, come all, we can all have a ball
When it's summertime and we all feel fine

[ CHORUS ]

(It's all good)Yeah(In the summertime)Say what?(It's all good)When(In the summertime)What we doin now?(We gettin together)Say what(Having fun
Keeping that love)How we keepin it?(one on one
It's all good)
