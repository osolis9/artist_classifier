Suicide-Music:Get Busy Committee
You could take our lives, fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I won't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die

Yeah' cause even if I gotta live a life of crime
You got it, imma get it, never need it, 9 to 5
I push it to the limit, 'til it's time to say goodbye
That's fine, 'cause I know just where I'm going when I die (die, die)

See me in the microscope, see me in the fish tank
Chicks want to know my real name plus the dick length
Me? I'm a scientist, God to a lab rat,
Now I'm just a has-been rapper in a hazmat
Duckin' spray shots, sewing up wounds,
filling up tombs, let the bass boom
Blood everywhere, so chaotic,
I'm a bullet with your name on it
Seekin' body after body????????? ain't in office anymore
But he's still Illuminatti,
Death to the king, overthrow everything
They'll be searching our apartments in an ATF sting
G-g-get busy, scum of the Earth,
hold a black magic seance to summon my verse,
I'm a walking skeleton, the zombie that will rush the crowd
Devil baby, I was born inside a mushroom cloud

You could take our lives, fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I won't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die

Yeah' cause even if I gotta live a life of crime
You got it, imma get it, never need it, 9 to 5
I push it to the limit, 'til it's time to say goodbye
That's fine, 'cause I know just where I'm going when I die (die, die)

Suicide music, nothing to fucking fool with,
full clip in the Uzi
Shooting now at some zookies,
no excuse, we blast now,
splatter your goose down
Clapping like it's the Yen,????? your fucking movie
Asking for passes,
homie I'm not a coobie
Here to blow your brains all over your bitches' boobies
Take me alive? Never,
better to die free
I'm writing "fuck the police" inside a good-bye letter
Peace, fade to black, call the priest
Tell them to call heaven and save me a few seats
Sorry it's the last minute, I'm bringing a few peeps
Body, the lieutenant, who took a shoot at the chief, sheesh
Guess I got a little problem with authority
Tend to get a little bit gruesome and gory,
Volume on 10, if I gotta get it in,
always keep a pistol grip pump
Sitting on my lap like a Yorkie

You could take our lives, fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I won't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die

Yeah' cause even if I gotta live a life of crime
You got it, imma get it, never need it, 9 to 5
I push it to the limit, 'til it's time to say goodbye
That's fine, 'cause I know just where I'm going when I die (die, die)
