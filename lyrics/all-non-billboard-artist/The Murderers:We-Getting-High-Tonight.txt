We-Getting-High-Tonight:The Murderers
Gangsta shit
Fuck the drive by means you gettin' high
Ya feel it? This is funk
Get ya dick sucked, get ya clit licked
This that shit word to God, listen

I gotta unconditional love for sex money and drugs
Bitches who strip in clubs, get hit with dick from thugs
Sweet thing, my dick is thick like sugar cane
Give me brain 'til my heads shrink' an
If you drink' an, I'm think' an
About coppin' you a mink an' in the pink Lincoln

Bitches wanna navigator, having alligators
And aqua flavor[unverified]that wear cops and drops and shit
When you my bitch you get to ride my dick
And drive my six, I have you high as shit
It ain't no secret, that I stay on creep shit
Sweetness, my weakness is freak shit

Black Child, we busting billion dollar babies
For Lexus's my lady, we name daughter Mercedes
Keep her shinin', jewels ain't just son diamonds
Thats a girls best friend, now hoes start hollerin'

All my bitches in the club that love dick from thugs
Come fuck with us
(We gettin' high tonight)
And all my niggas takin' dough, and cakin' on the low
And fuckin' all them hoes
(We gettin' high tonight)

All my bitches in the club that love dick from thugs
Come fuck with us
(We gettin' high tonight)
And all my niggas takin' dough, and cakin' on the low

This shit right here is for all y'all money makers
Y'all rappers, y'all actors, anybody makin' papers
The hustlers, the honies, anybody gettin' money
Its all good when its all gone, its funny
The Lexus, the Infinity was just a fantasy
But cream bring dreams to reality

I been in million dollar hoods, and billion dollar ghettos
Smoked blunts with devils, caught bodies with metal
Had all types of females, and no need to details
On how I keep my Coke price below retail
We bouncin' in and outta countries like an immigrant
Snatchin' up yens and pesos and dead presidents

Thats probably why shit got hot so quick
Slingin' bricks, gettin' cash, with my click
And its all good the way we be livin' life
Spendin' hundreds during the day and making g's in the night

You only live once, and you only die once
You gotta make what you want
(Nigga)
And take what you want
(Bitches)

You only live once, and you only die once
You gotta make what you want
(Nigga)
And take what you want
(Bitches)

Tonight, we gettin' high and we fuckin' for life
Ahh right, niggas I run with stay on some dumb shit
Bitch, we'll make you come quick, love to let the gun spit
After dark thats when the blunts get sparked
The 'dro get lit, the hoes get hit, ya know this shit
Is the Hennessey life, Remmy with ice
Sticky green, kna I mean?
We gettin' high tonight
