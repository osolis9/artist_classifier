Shout-It-Out:Charizma
The road is getting narrow
Straighter than an arrow
Run the race, run strong
Focus on the One
Great is our mission
Break down resistance
Revolution of love
Spreading throughout the world

Shout it out to the corners of the earth
Will you let your voice be heard?
Your life, shining like a lighthouse in the night
Through the power of the Son
Til we see the Kingdom come
Shout it out, shout it out

Freedom bells are ringing
Tell me are you willing
To be part of the plan
To restore the soul of man
Global revolution
Make your contribution
Theres a hunger you can feed
Help the ones in need

Dont keep it a secret, dont hide your faith
Choose to live life fully, give yourself away
Run to win the race, remember Jesus said
"I am with you always, til the very end of the age"

Its a revolution of love
Spreading throughout the world
