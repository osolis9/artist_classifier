Gospel-Weed-Song:Bizarre
Brothers and sisters!
We gonna have Church tonight!
And tonight this speaker is, Reverend Ruffus Jackson.

I wake up praising, God every day,
I wanna... smoke some weed and roll me the J,
Thankya Jesus! (Thankyou Jesus!)
Thankya Lord! (Thankyou Lord!)
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

Nigger I'm high, nigger you high. (uh huh)
lets get high in the motherfucking sky!
Watch the butterflies, hit the wall,
and if you're feeling down, give yer boy a call!
Weed, it takes the stress away,
thats why Bizarre smokes ten blunts a day.
It's nuffing but the sticky, icky, green stuff!
Line it, pass it and take a puff!
Having a bad day, stop by my house,
coz most likely, I've got a blunt in my mouth.
So sit down relax and chill,
and if ya don't smoke weed, then shit, I got sum pills!
Watch ya need girl,
a fucking refill?
a fat bag a weed
and sum happy meals?
Nah, baby, I don't smoke no porks,
only fat bags of weed in this escort.

I wake up praising, God every day,
I wanna... smoke some weed and roll me the J,
Thankya Jesus! (Thankyou Jesus!)
Thankya Lord! (Thankyou Lord!)
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

Sunday morning, Bizarre have day,
Blunt in my mouth, watching DJ Dre.
Dangerous my, just like Cudio
Only church I know, a snoop dogg's studio.
Wide out the raps, blowing in my lap,
Rap hennesy, keep the acid tap.
I'm glad, that I didnt't go down south,
Take care of my kids, be the man of the house,
orange mushrooms, and yellow stars,
Fat bags of weed(?)
Get in and lap, come on jump in,
Raid a bottle of gin, and two of your freaky friends
O fuck it! Let's go to see the point,
Bring your son alone, shit, he can hit the joint,
Cause rapping, it's a full time job!
All I wanna smoke weed and praise God!

I wake up praising, God every day,
I wanna... smoke some weed and roll me the J,
Thankya Jesus! (Thankyou Jesus!)
Thankya Lord! (Thankyou Lord!)
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!
