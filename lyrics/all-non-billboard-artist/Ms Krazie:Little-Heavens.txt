Little-Heavens:Ms Krazie
My Love.. 
Come Back... 
To Me.. 

First Verse: 

I don't know how to describe it,
Because I miss you. 
I wish I would've had the chance to hold you & to kiss you. 
To keep you in my arms safe & never let you go. 
I promise little one your momma loved you. (I loved you)
Don't you ever doubt it, 
I know you're looking down.
& I can't wait to see you. 
When the heavens bring you down, 
I mean I won't let you go for a second time. 
My soul couldn't take it. 
It's like take my heart & break it. 
I think about you every time I close my eyes, 
& I hold on to my faith so your memory never dies. 
I will forever be in debt with you,
Because you showed me how to love a way I never knew. 

Hook:

(My Love)
I know you're never coming back
(Come Back)
& My hopes are fading fast
(To Me)
I'm holding on my ???? 'cus my heart is filled with sorrow.
(My Love)
Missing you is killing me
(Come Back)
But you'll always be a part of me
(To Me)
I need to find the strength to hold on til tomorrow. 

Second verse:

See the thing is, 
I wanna see you again. 
I never got over the fact,
I just can't play pretend. 
& pretend you never happened
when I heard your heart. 
God had some other plans for you from the start. 
& I try to understand but I really can't. 
I mean I wanted you so bad,
What was so wrong with that? 
I know I wasn't perfect, 
I was acting a fool. 
I couldn't make a decision of what I thought I knew. 
Thinking I could live my life pushing God away,
Until I got a big reminder when you couldn't stay. 
Then my eyes really opened, 
Something had to change. 
I wasn't willing to go through something like that again.

Hook:

(My Love)
I know you're never coming back
(Come Back)
& My hopes are fading fast
(To Me)
I'm holding on my ???? 'cus my heart is filled with sorrow.
(My Love)
Missing you is killing me
(Come Back)
But you'll always be a part of me
(To Me)
I need to find the strength to hold on til tomorrow.

Third Verse: 

Wish I would've had the chance, 
To hold your tiny hands. 
& sing you lullabies before I put you to bed. 
Wish i could've seen your eyes, 
Heard your little cries. 
Held you to my chest & knew that you were okay. 
I mean I gotta believe because if not i'll break down. 
I gotta know that you're in heaven & you're smiling down. 
Trust that God had his reasons, 
I was blessed to even have you.
Even for a second i'm so glad that I had you. 
But that doesn't take the pain away. 
Even though it's been years I keep on feeling this way. 
I mean my heart remains broken, 
They tore my soul apart. 
The day they took you from me will forever be hard.
