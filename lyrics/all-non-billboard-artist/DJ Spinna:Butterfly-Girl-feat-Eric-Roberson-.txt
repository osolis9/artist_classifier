Butterfly-Girl-feat-Eric-Roberson-:DJ Spinna
Dear butterfly
Time is so precious
Your purpose here is to fly
If it's not love
Ask yourself
Are you just here wasting your time

You don't like how this cat treats you
But still you choose to follow
Right down the path your heart is unwilling to go, baby
Deep inside you know he's not matching
Your heart, your passion, and time invested in him
'Cause it seems he's so hard to find lately

You want something more
But still you ignore
The reasons for love
The reasons that we're here for
Your heart deserves a true feeling
A partner to touch it inside
There's no need to leave
You just feel the need to hide, baby

Dear butterfly
Time is so precious
Your purpose here is to fly
If it's not love
Ask yourself
Are you just here wasting your time

Dear butterfly girl

He second your second guessing
Keeps you away from your path
All roads will lead you
To blessings you don't know you have, baby

What is it you feel you are chasing?
Are you just racing against time?
Why don't you just slow down?
Make sure that your steps are in line, baby

You wonder why his love
Is not stronger as it was
But don't stop your heart
Don't stay just because, lady

I know that you want something special
Why not be careful with your soul?
You keep jumping in and falling in love
Instead of letting it grow-ow-ow-ow

Dear butterfly
Time is so precious
Your purpose here is to fly (your purpose here is to fly)
If it's not love
Ask yourself
Are you just here wasting your time
Dear butterfly lady

And also to the guy
Why not take time to see
how sweet that girl can be?
If we let down our guards
and let our loving in
We may begin
To realize what it is we have
If it's just a game
Be honest with yourself
Go play that somewhere else
No need to lead her to a place
Don't intend to be displeased with her

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Dear butterfly
Time is so precious
Your purpose here is to fly (is to fly)
If it's not love (if it's not love)
Ask yourself are (come on, girl)
You just here wasting your time (wasting your time)
(Oh, my baby, one more time)

Dear butterfly (dear butterfly)
Time is so precious (time is so precious)
Your purpose here is to fly (your purpose here is to - is to fly)
If it's not love (love, yeah, yeah)
Ask yourself are (ask yourself, baby)
You just here wasting your time? (Are you just wasting your time, baby girl)

Dear butterfly (uh-huh)
Time is so precious
Your purpose here is to fly (is to fly, baby girl, yeah)
If it's not love
Ask yourself are
You just here wasting your time? (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
