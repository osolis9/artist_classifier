The city is on acid
The city is on fire,
The city is on acid, fire.

Joelistics verse l
Paint a picture with language and memory
beaten in to shape with the rhythm and melody
my performance more like therapy
translate poetry to punishable herasy
So you know it clich√©s the enemy
Freestyles skill level more like telepathy
Word play grey matter designed for damaging
down for the chaos, gettin up anarchy
And I'm managing heart beat galloping
and I'm actually gravity's mannequin
and I'm back again there in the front
tryna make sense but the sense don't come
It don't matter tonight I'm brave
my behavior strange and deprave
I stay awake for days on end with an Mpc and a mic and a pen
I gotta problem with space. There' lots of it
but in the city you can't get enough of it
I like the touch of it, infinite, rush from it.
in life we stand on the cusp of it.
in death we dress in the best of it
that's the promise that we keep when we borrow from it.
it takes a body and a heart
to stay solid
You gotta heart tell me what you get from it.

The city is on acid
The city is on fire,
The city is on acid, fire.

Count Bounce verse 2
the city got reception, cross interference
speed through tunnels rap feel got the clearance
slack on the beat like smack on the dealers
watch the beat drop street got heat
not one of them on me
fear not I'm fearless
you can fake the fantasy but cant fake the realness
cause the dumps just got the land fill in it
and the waste of the city some stealing it
and these words are a back alley deal
and it ain't that hard for you to tell who's feeling it
cause mamma got a gun and she's holding it
hip hop interrogator sill not solving it
drop out demonstrator finger on the pulse
cant ever take the heart or the soul from it
drunk / sober the night ticks over
as the rays of the sun draw closer
shed light on the ugliness running this
in a cypher outside the pub and shit magic
ignite like match stick
still pumpin out smoke with the factories
plug into the feed now fantasy
no game now to play all reality
no switch for you to go and rerecord It
move foreword the future calls it
and all 4 walls are like mediatronic
snow crash the brain no trees for the forest
with the streets in chaos are the demons upon us
or we the beings who be bringer on the ruckus?

Joelistics verse 3
Language is a virus
that breeds in the silence
feeds on the minds of people who devised it
The books and the poems and the slang that designed it
reality defined by the words we assign it,
We gave a name to the apple and the diamond
dive in the depth in the realm of Poseidon
speak with a breath that ring like the horizon
meaning has a melody that rings like a siren
sings like a siren spins like a DJ
playin for the players in the arkum asylum
Now hit the replay and analyse timing
And look what I made harnessing lightning
To battle the right wing and travel the day
see what the night bring
get out of the way.
