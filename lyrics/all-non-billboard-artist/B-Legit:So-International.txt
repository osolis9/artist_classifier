So-International:B-Legit
Me and Too Short, we do the frequent miles
In and out of ports keep secret files
First peep the smile, then flash the wrist
Diamonds get them pissy when it's stashed like this
On a flash like this, according to the script
Hoes do the choosin', a boss he flipped
I skipped from Peru, went straight to the map
Them boys from the Bay and all day we be at it

Yea, we fly first class, touch down like pimps
What's the next event, tell me what town it's in
I'll see ya there man, I always do
I had some good weed, some hoes too
What the feinin' for, give it too'em
All around the world we get to do'em
When I'm on vacation everyday I fuck
Bad bitches see a player, wanna lay up

The places I go make me so international
People I meet make me so international
Wherever I go I'll be so international
Wherever it goes I'm just so international

I run into my folks, nothin's too far
Got a few breezies, gettin' drunk at the bar
I don't care where I'm at, I'll make ya girl share that
I step in the room she recognize a player mack
Known for my raps, gettin' blown in the back
Gimme 10 G's a microphone and some 'Yak
And don't forget my Kahlua and Baliey's
Look and learn, don't ask me what I'll do to ya lady

Now what I'll do to ya lady, I'll do to ya life
Come through, break you, get out with my stripes
Pipe down big dog, ain't no need to be soar
'Cuz I'll I'm comin' for is the Christian Dior
Catch ya boy off shore, candy bars in the store
Forever papered up but they handed me more
Did Twins in Minnesota at the All-Star Break
Bounced all accross state on them concert dates

The places I go make me so international
People I meet make me so international
Wherever I go I'll be so international
Wherever it goes I'm just so international

California Baby, that's the way we get down
Handcuff'em now, you know we comin' to town
No, we don't smoke brown but we do shoot rounds
Green 16's over Rick Rock sounds
Call me flip flop now, mix yellow and brown
Korean, European, know they all get down
Muslims get the money, man, I'll see you in Guam
I'm there 2 weeks need freaks and bomb

We knocked these grey girls from Oregon
They had a flight to catch early in the mornin' to Portland
It doesn't matter where ya from, baby
It's the last line, we can have some fun, maybe
Me and B-La, yea, we got jungle fever
But it's all about the money with us
We don't want ya people to think we discrimanatin'
Can't make the pimpin' wait
I spit a lil' game then I listen to what women say

The places I go make me so international
People I meet make me so international
Wherever I go I'll be so international
Wherever it goes I'm just so international
