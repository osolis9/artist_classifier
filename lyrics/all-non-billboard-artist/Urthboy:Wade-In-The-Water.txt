Wade-In-The-Water:Urthboy
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, baby don't you think we're lucky that we had it good for so long
We hit the jackpot, edge we got from where we come from
Poplar trees swaying in the wind, dead quiet
'cept the single engine of a passing headlight
Do you remember what that life's like?
And now your dad project a slideshow on Christmas night
My heart sunk on weekends with the rain outside
Because the cricket's called off, we could've got outright
Right? Right, day to day is cruisy on the mountainside
And bushfires used to only come in summertime
Apart from that it's fine, life's so easy otherwise
Sleepy streets mostly all free of crime
Kind of place to raise a daughter
We can reconcile our fortune in the natural order
But what's around the corner?
I know for sure that if you're ever dragged into the deep
I'll wade into the water
[Hook: Jane Tyrell]
I'll be staying by your side
I will be staying by your side
Whatever we're facing I won't run
Wherever we're drifting from
I'm staying by your side

[Pre-Verse]
But suddenly you're standing there in front of me, I'm crushing hard
And part of me is to excited
Dive into a love affair, right into each other's arms
Neither of us frightened
Not a single person on the planet could've swapped, nah
Yeah that feeling when you think you're gonna be with someone till you drop
Till you drop, till you drop, till you drop

[Verse 2]
We had been together since forever when the tipping point came
Dam broke, that's when everything changed
We had been through thick and thin but bigger things lurked
Have you ever envisioned your city in flames?
No, neither of us think about when we were of a certain type
Of people that just never thought they were in range
Well, we raised a kid to think the same
The fighting that was taking place well that was always somewhere far away
Channel 24 got it, run it round the clock, got it
Switch channel, get on Twitter, read it, retweet it
Look out your front door, streets are at war streets
Streets to the mall and an army being called
Is the city gonna fall while they tell us stay calm?
With another close call, why are children being armed?
As we join other people tryna flee to the border
Promise if you're at sea then I'll wade in the water

[Hook: Jane Tyrell]
I'll be staying by your side
I will be staying by your side
Whatever we're facing I won't run
Wherever we're drifting from
I'm staying by your side
