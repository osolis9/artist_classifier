Heart-Crush:BJ the Chicago Kid
[Verse 1]
So sick of trying
So tired of lying
Past the point of dying
No compromising
And that fire we had girl just couldn’t survive the rain
Heard the weather man telling us that it was gonna shower some pain

[Hook]
Sometimes we want to work so bad we stay too long
Then too long turns to too much
Cuz too much's how two hearts crush

Sometimes it gets too much
A lot of everything but no love
Just too much
That’s how two hearts crush

[Verse 2]
Arguing about everything
And having sex just to make me happy
Our folks think we got everything
But they don’t know that we so unhappy
Every time I hear a love song on the radio
I think of what we used to have but ain’t got no more
Like that fire we had girl just couldn’t survive the rain
Heard the weather man telling us that it was gonna shower some pain

[Hook]
Sometimes we want to work so bad we stay too long
Then too long turns to too much
Cuz too much is how two hearts crush

Sometimes it gets too much
A lot of everything but no love
Just too much
That’s how two hearts crush

[Outro x2]
I swear it feel like pain got a thang for me
It’s like love want me to be in pain and want me to leave
I swear it feel like pain got a thang for me
It’s like love want me to be in pain and want me to leave
