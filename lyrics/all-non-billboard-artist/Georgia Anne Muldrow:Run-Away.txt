Run-Away:Georgia Anne Muldrow
[Verse 1:]
Woke and realized I was free
To be anything if it was an integrity
With what I dream, I knew it couldn't be wrong
And would be done I was born to be Earth's song

[Chorus:]
And I feel like I'm running not away
But to take off and fly
Using this life as a run away
And I feel like I'm running not away
But to take off and fly
Using this life as a run away

[Verse 2:]
Going to sleep and other worlds I've seen
Where my thoughts turn into thangs
Magical, intangible, and know how fresh we would be
If we took our dreams seriously
'Cause I-I-I-I-I

[Chorus:]
I feel like I'm running not away
But to take off and fly
Using this life as a run away
And I feel like I'm running not away
But to take off and fly
Using this life as a run away

[vocal break]

[Chorus:]
So if you feel like you're running
Don't run away, just take off and fly
Use this lifetime as a run away
You feel like you're running
Don't run away, just take off and fly
Use this lifetime as a run way

Oh yeah...
Take off and fly
Take off and fly
Take off and fly
You just, you just, you just, you just
You just fly baby
Just fly away {Fade}
