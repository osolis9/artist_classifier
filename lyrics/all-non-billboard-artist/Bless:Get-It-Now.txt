Get-It-Now:Bless
It's too late in the game now
Platinum-berg
We done came to far
All my soldiers
There's no turning back
March!
Hey, yo, these cats don't be acting right
They don't be rapping tight
They holds out switch quick like a hermaphrodite
I'm ready kill the beat
Now we livin' in the afterlife
And whether black or white y'all feel the sacrifice
I'm moving past the ice, the crystal medallion, shit faced, while in popping bottles like volumes
Drink by the gallon, and piss on ya' album
and profile
were two coke'd out Italians
These labels didn't sign me
figure the loss
