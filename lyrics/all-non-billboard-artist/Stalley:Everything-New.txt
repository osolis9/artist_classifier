Everything-New:Stalley
Pulling tricks about my bag
X-nay on the Jag
Pulling back them tags
Everything new, feeling never gets old
Yellow go whites
Everything, everything slipping from my fingers
Always a gentleman, always distinguished
Everything, everything new, think like a heathen
Speak like a gingis sultry O'Neil
Everything, everything new

Just came through the right door
Now they're tryin' to push me left
I'm trying to get it right more

Haters got me vexing
Loading up this rifle
I'm thinking that I might go
Dump getting drunk and in hate mode
Cruising through the flat slow

Everything is not fault
Me I be honest, but I'm a try to get it all
Gee, I'll be on it

This is just the calm before the storm gets
Crazy dollar bills fall, let me get my charmslet
Ask them why they coming
Young nigga owes heads man cause they lost it

Then blow your Ts never crossed it

Making fur lynx, gator on that shoe
She got haters on her too

When everything new
Just keep quiet and let that money talk
Get the hell up in this two seater
Sweep through this city like a group
