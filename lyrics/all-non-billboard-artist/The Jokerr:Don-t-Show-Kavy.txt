Don-t-Show-Kavy:The Jokerr
You could even see me after Lasik surgery
(See me even after major Lasik surgery)
Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
(Ayo, skip all glamour and glitz, I plan to get rich)
But I ain't takin' crap from nobody like septic tank service workers on strike
(Everybody I'm not takin' your shit like out of service port-a-potties)????
Crap in your house and purposely not courtesy flush, my ego...
(Kavy on the mic murderous, poop in your house and purposely not courtesy flush)

Hey Kav, Just letting you know man, I don't know what this is going to do to us as friends
But I feel like I feel for a reason that I had to get it off my chest
(Recording of Kav: You're seriously the most talented MC I've ever heard. I'm, I'm not even fucking exaggerating, bro
You're fucking sick. You are my favorite rapper)

Well, let me with start with a disclaimer
I haven't pitched a fever
And I'm not on some "Knock you out when I see You" shit either
I'm not really bitter
I'm not really mad
I just need to cordially address some issues that I had!
See, you've been a big fan, and I appreciate it greatly
But a subtle annoyance has been boiling as of lately
If imitation is the greatest compliment you can give
Well, frankly, I'm all complimented out, my nig!
See I got up at the diss game as a true right of Passage
I'm passed giving out frivolous ass lyrical actions
You think you the biggest nigga on the block
You can test it
In certain cases merit it neccessary to oppress it
As an example, this is a case where Jokerr was patient
In trying to nurish you as an artist and hoping you make it
But you've been insisting on, spitting it back in his face
And there's not much of that shit he takes for Jokerr to brace it
It started back when your first album was being crafted
I made the comment, "I frollick naked through cactus patches"
It wasn't but a week later
You came back with it written back into one of your verses
And spit it without even asking!
I found it intrusive, but screw it I needed the cash
And you were paying me like 250 a track back when you snatched it
You sneaky bastard, you were a rap-jacking-felon
I should've listened to the little voice in my head telling me.

Don't show Kavy
If you're ill and he knows
Homie just be careful what you disclose
He'll listen and smile
But wish all the while
That your lyrics were his and then he'll act on it
Oh-ho Kavy
Oh, how I hate what you've done
To make me say you are a fake and a sponge
You're a rapper but i don't know if you'll make it as one
I'm sorry homie take it and run

Yo
Alledgedly, you write disses for every rapper you spit with
Just incase they double-cross you and you need to be defensive
Well, guilty-artist-suspicions, my nigga, let's get it cracking
Let's see your best shot, without your boy the Jokerr backing
See, there's noone in your sessions, so noone sees me catching
All your inconsistent phrasings and me helping you correct them
It's really not an issues, and I'm happy to assist you
I just wish you'd quit fishing, and just appreciate the blessing
Now, you shower me with mentions every hour of our kinships
But as a convient distraction to your cowardly infringements
And every self-respecting rapper knows that's a symptom
Of a Jealous-ass-fella hiding bellows of resentment
Now I understand you're frightened and the difficulty writing
When you're recording your albums in the shadow of a Titan
But remember I'm a storm full of lightning and I'll strike at ya
You're bitings equivalent of skipping naked flying kites in it
I gave you plenty chances you gave the same excuses
That I thwarted, you then resorted to blatant playing stupid
You backed me in the corner and you made the Jokerr do this
You betrayed me, and now I feel like the Saviour choking Judas
So, if anyones to come across a copy of this track
If you could keep it to yourself, that'd be optimal in fact
Listen once, flip it over and scratch it with keys
I just don't want him stealing lines to diss me back with so please

Now he's come to the conclusion
Of my thorough ego bruising
I'd just like to note to all involved this wasn't of my choosing
I was put in this position
Jokerr just needed to vent
This is rap intervention!
I hope that you see and repent!
See we all love you
We just sick of you biting niggas
There's programs
And 12-step plans for your type of sickness
Listen, you suffer from a lack of confidence
Just Call 1-800-BITING ASS NIGGAS ANONYMOUS
Hopefully, someone will answer and show you compassion
And help you ration all your shameless ass faggot swagger jacking
Cause I'm sick of it
And you know I'm the wrong nigga to start it with
I get out of hand faster than text message arguments
I'm sick of your rhyme-stealing illegitimate tracks
Now you got me feeling like a gorilla, flicking a gnat
But I had to do it
Your buzz was bugging me
