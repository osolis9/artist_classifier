Skywalker:Denzel Curry
Oh my god, Ronny

I keep the heat so let me be discreet
The highs and lows, the skies and then the streets
The life I live has took a part of me
The only Hell resides in my memories

I can't even fathom the way I've been livin'
I'm tripping out, too many people be all in my business
I'm ripping out my hair follicles 'cause
Everybody want a particle of my soul
If I have one, I can't even fathom
Oh, Lord, they put me on the fire
If they can't love ya, they try to crucify ya
Took my nigga Moses and took my damn messiah
When I'm underseas, I can only hear higher

I keep the heat so let me be discreet
The highs and lows, the skies and then the streets
The life I live has took a part of me
The only Hell resides in my memories

It feels like you're ripping the skin off me
Too many parasites, please get off me
I'ma do what the rain does
But when I go outside, it's like it rain blood
You just a hoe so you'll never be my main blood
You say we bros when we never shared the same blood
So my god, get the fuck out with that bullshit today, uh
Fake shit get hit with a full clip today, yee
I need a sign, uh, I'm out my mind, I
Never had love cause they say love is blind, ah

I keep the heat so let me be discreet
The highs and lows, the skies and then the streets
The life I live has took a part of me
The only Hell resides in my memories

I can't even fathom the way I've been livin'
I'm tripping out, too many people be all in my business
I'm ripping out my hair follicles 'cause
Everybody want a particle of my soul
If I have one, I can't even fathom
Oh! (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh! (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh!
Oh!
