Keep-Praying:Outsidaz
I was born in the south land
Grew up rolling stone
Working all day in factories
Was livin' it all alone

I got no friends to call my own
No woman to love me
My life just seems to be slipping away
Thinking about jumping in the sea

I'm gonna keep praying
Everything's gonna be alright
Keep praying
Everything's gonna be alright

About a month or so ago
I was working in Tennessee
Tried to make time with another man's woman
And he turned around and tried to shoot me

I'm gonna keep praying
Everything's gonna be alright
Yes I do, yes I do
Keep praying
Everything's gonna be alright
Aahhh
