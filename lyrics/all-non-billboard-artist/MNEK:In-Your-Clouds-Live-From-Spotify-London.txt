Shisha, skunk, Grey Goose, baby what you saying?
Took a booze, baby what you saying?
Shisha, skunk, Grey Goose, baby what you saying?
Took a booze, baby what you saying?
Shisha, skunk, Grey Goose, baby what you saying?
Took a booze, baby what you saying?
Shisha, skunk, Grey Goose, baby what you saying?
Took a booze, baby what you saying?

I just want to be
All up in your clouds
And be so high up there
That I can never ever come down
Even if we kiss
I can't feel my mouth
It's not that deep, it's just a crush
Not hard to figure it out

I just want to be
All up in your clouds
And through the haze, just find a place
That I can figure it out
That I can figure it out
Just find a place
Take me to that place

You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
Shisha, skunk, Grey Goose, baby what you saying?
Took a booze, baby what you saying?

You're a pool of desire
I just want to drown
Drunk off your infatuation
You spin me round and round
If you tell me stop
I'll dream the night away
I'm just having fun, there's no reason
To be afraid
I just want to be
All up in your clouds
And through the haze, just find a place
That I can figure it out
That I can figure it out
Just find a place
Take me to that place

You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
Now we're in the sky
Never seen anything so blue
It's ironic, if I'm honest
Cause I'm so happy with you
There's an energy
When you're next to me
Direct me to a place
Where I can leave my mind and just be free
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
You take me to that place I love
