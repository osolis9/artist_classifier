Legend:Mickey Factz
I am a legend
I'm living life
These niggers hatin'
I'm doing something right
I make it happen every day every night
I am legend

It's the number one push up
Put you rapps in the facts
Gonna for a second now I'm back for a while
You can... my little cousin
He's as bad as a champ/child
Now he's at college with a...
And that made me proud
He showed me I can make it
He told me I'm the greatest
Cause he knows I wasn't faking
I was only being patient
I'm still in every second
A murder would take time
I'm killing every rapper

These lyrics are my weapon
If I aim them at your head
You'll be brain dead
I'm married to the game

Up from the bed
I'm looking to the mirror
Today I'll be better than you
Look what I'm wearing
Got my pride on my shirt
My heart on my sleeve
My thoughts on my kicks
All this love in my jeans

And you know it seems

I was supposed to beg
We'll see I was told
Don't let the money change you
Get out of my way
You won't like me when I'm angry
They say it's truly as dough
... no with this music shit bro
Got that crucifix flow
I carry it in my cross
I'm headin' up the cavalry
Looking for the lords

I'm back
They said I wouldn't last
They told me break a leg
But they wouldn't sell my cast
They pray for...
But I didn't win...
Seeing life to the blast
I think a girl said
He's running out of cash
Bills coming up the ass
And my mama wanted back
I got a free car
But I don't give free gas
It's nothing up on this life that's gonna last
That's the legacy we ly
So please all remember you breath
I'll never gonna be what I've said I wouldn't be
I am legend so I tell them what I see
