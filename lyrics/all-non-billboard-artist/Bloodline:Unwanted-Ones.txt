Unwanted-Ones:Bloodline
When he woke
He was frozen to the bone
No thoughts inside his head
His dreams have now all flown
A day of solitude
No will to start
No feelings in his heart

Life was never this complicated
He can’t recall where it went wrong
I believe in yesterday
Used to only be a song
Once a hero for his country
In a country he did not belong

When she woke
She was frozen to the core
She was a mother once
Now lost forever more
A day of solitude 
On the concrete plains
Another day of shame

Life was never this complicated
She had a home and a family
Now her home is where she stumbles
Where she falls is where she sleeps
She’s tomorrow’s mystery
Another soul that God no longer keeps

Like a prayer no one hears
Like a life of wasted years
Like a gift from a thief
Like a church without belief
Like a cloud across the sun
When a new day has begun
What they’ve become
Unwanted ones

When she fell
she was frozen to the core
Today is tomorrow’s memory
And lost forever more
Nicotine stains
On her finger tips 
cigarettes gathered from the floor

Life was never this complicated
Silent cries are all she hears
She survives without existing
As the sun sets on her tears
A night of solitude
On the concrete plains, another night of fears

Like a prayer no one hears
Like a life of wasted years
Like a gift from a thief
Like a church without belief
Like a cloud across the sun
When a new day has begun
What they’ve become
Unwanted ones

I saw someone dying
I saw someone dying
Look at me
Look at you 
Look at us
I saw someone dying
I saw someone dying
Look at me
Look at you
Look at us

Like a prayer no one hears
Like a life of wasted years
Like a gift from a thief
Like a church without belief
Like a cloud across the sun
When a new day has begun
What they’ve become
Unwanted ones
