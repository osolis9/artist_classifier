No-Secret:Black Milk
Haven't told a soul
But they seem to know
Didn't say a word
But I've been overheard

I guess it's obvious
How I feel about us
They say that I'm a hopeless case
It's written right there all over my face

It's no secret, no matter what I do
I can't help but feel it
There's no use in playing it cool
It's no secret, gotta let you know
'Cause I really feel it
Baby, I'm in love with you

When you talk so sweet
I get a little bit weak
When I see that smile
My heart goes wild

When we finally touch
Ah, ah and then a voice inside me screams
Don't be shy

It's no secret, no matter what I do
I can't help but feel it
There's no use in playing it cool
It's no secret, gotta let you know
'Cause I really feel it
Baby, I'm in love with you

I picture us together, in a world that's just for two
It's my vision of forever, can you see it too?

What do I have to do for you to understand?
Gotta get through to you baby if I can
