Sounds-of-Music:Mars ILL
We invite you and your section to witness pure perfection
Right here in the form of these finest phonograph selections
Drums in all directions, arrange tonal inflections
Sound penetrates your chest like some sort of ill infection
Reflect eternally on these high fidelity masters
Whisper secrets in your ears in the form of ghetto blasters
Rap until the rapture, what you need, not what you want
As we represent the artform that was born in the Bronx
Forming the songs that haunt fake emcees nightmares
Might scare you straighter than the mayor did Times Square
Right there, the dopest vocalist hold this down like an anchor
Driving the mic like a motorist yelling, "Rappers are in Danger!"
Beautify tracks like trains by graff painters
Speak to rap fans like family even though you're perfect strangers
Emcees showing their anger, so they be, they stand true
The sounds of music, do re mi, peace to Julie Andrews.
Sounds bounce through back alleys, pound the grouds of where you live
We found the call to pack venues wall to wall and we did
For all you kids, heads, whoever who are holding it down
All in all we do this now so you can soak up the sound.
(Repeat)
Behold the now, evolution of stereophonic sound
Ultrasonic combinations of thought and revolution
Lock down spots like a convict, plus I've made a resolution
Don't take part in popular practice of mind and noise pollution
Voiced the best solution but no one really wants to hear
The God of Abraham and Isaac was the answer all these years
Do I have to strike hearts like Richard Gere with primal fear
In the drivers' seat of life but really much too blind to steer
Target ears with acoustic weapons, the music of the culture
Collect props from heads like Fleer, but won't be honored with a sculpture
Steer clear of idolotry even if you might call it me
I'd fall to see hypocrisy held high in the halls of we
I tell the fly to be grounded, the sharp to be well rounded
When you've mastered the facets of the craft, they'll be astounded
Hold fast to syllabic patterns and different forms of meter
Use the vocab, teach the masses when you're blasting through the speaker
The power's behind the tongue, I'm the novel, you're the reader
I'm the manCHILD, I' speak for the Most High, Elohim the leader
Surpassing heads who are lofty or holding it down for the underground
Behold the now, evolution of stereophonic sound.
