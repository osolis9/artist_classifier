Wreck-the-Discotech:E-TRAIN
There's a new white boy in the game and it ain't Bubba
And it ain't M, his uncle, cousin or his brother
It's another cousin my mother missing thunder
Could turn me into the sun or turn me into tundra
Now I got a hot flow watch me rock a drop rolls
With the mag in my lap and them Prada hot clothes
And I'm bout that money honey I don't know how to not grow
Take it from me dummy I show you how to pop pro
Aim at your brain knock it outta ya skull
In the middle of nowhere like how did he know
I know everything didn't you hear
See these kittens got deBeers for their mittens and ears
And they look sexy matching the train
Neon green on me sweet pink on the thing
And the other women prey to meet me
When they see that new Lambo with the Train graffiti, I.

I ain't never been and never will
I'll never be a has been
I did it definition of my spitting in the past tense
Living in the moment it was spoken this is epic
I flip shit and they say the kid was dyslexic
I kick shit they say this is eclectic
Connected my brainwaves are electric
Infectious but I can't pass the germ
So I cop cribs whips kicks cash and fur
And I'm riding with a honey she the baddest girl
Plus the diamonds match those of the passenger
And you can laugh at her but can't play with the Train
I'll be laughing too all the way to the bank
