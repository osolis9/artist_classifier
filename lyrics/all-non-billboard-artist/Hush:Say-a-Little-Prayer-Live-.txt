Say-a-Little-Prayer-Live-:Hush
Don' talk much, reveal nothing
don't complain a lot, never show a thing

Frosty trees will grab at you until you fall
and dark birds above you will follow you from this day on

But the pain is concealed
there is nothing here to see
except for a broken and shattered heart

Say a little, say a little prayer
everything you wanted lies right here
and I'll say a little, say a little prayer
I hope some day you'll reach out again
I'll say a little, say a little prayer...

Colder, when you turn away
older, when you face yourself

You cry out loud but you're caught in silence
and echoes fall as an icy rain on your skin

But the pain is concealed
there is nothing here to see
except for a broken and shattered heart

Don't talk, reveal nothing...
