Stop-Being-Greedy:Necro
(Uncle Howie)

Hey, this is Uncle Howie,
I'm the master clone, the king of beasts
The alpha male, I do not fail
When I'm on the prowl,
Yeah, I burn my bridges
My balls got ridges

(Necro)

Brand new Necro (shouting)

(Uncle Howie)

Stop Being Greedy
Buy some fucking cd's
this is Uncle Howie
reppin' the psychological street villains

(Necro)

(chorus 2x)

Y'all been eating long enough, Stop being greedy
ya downloadin ma shit, buy some fuckin cd's
support this shit, don't pull their tapes
fuck around and I'ma fight you, smash your face

(verse 1)

Morbid's my factual fate, anger developed in me at a gradually rate
now my natural state, is actual hate
every patrol man is my opponent, is upper swollen
if your foamin' every moment, is my atonement avomence
every species with a brain, can be sleezy and insane
it is easy to obtain, anger splurgin' at the course
like sweat galour gore, violent temples spite back to watch to catch you
peep the blood red flow invented necro, a rare skill
ill like blendin blazz grill take a bolt to drill repulsive
beautiful exit gore, make-up Playtex
Make-up Playtex, rockin' gay fuck, bitch with a-cup
you need tits, I'll sew â€˜em on your spine
you'll be blowin' on my nine
blast you full of metal cum into your mind
get yourself fur, cause when I'm depressed you get blessed
your breasts (narkles?) leave you booty thugs grotesque ingest

(Chorus 2x)

(Uncle Howie)

This is Uncle Howie, stop downloading and start buying
make sure you caught brutality pt. 1
in September, like a bundle of crack
