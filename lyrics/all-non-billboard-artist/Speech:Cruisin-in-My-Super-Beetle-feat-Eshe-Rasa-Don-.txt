Cruisin-in-My-Super-Beetle-feat-Eshe-Rasa-Don-:Speech
Cruisin' in my super beetle I've been speeding way above the limit
and still can't reach my goal oh no
getting tired of the cardiovascular on a treadmill
no destination no scenery and no roads uh huh

Everybody's striving to get to the top making moves
and the wheels don't stop
never take a moment to breathe the fresh air
going someplace but never getting there
I'd like to say
I live to play every day's a whole new game
if I could take more time enjoy the pace

I'm like a super star times my fan base
I can't do this without you with me
not enough time to take in everything
so what I can take don't wanna waste it
play some golf and get an endorsement
take my time there's no need to force it
life's too short and too fast to chase it
no need going crazy

take a little time and relax your mind (woo)

Cruisin' in my super beetle
I've been speeding way above the limit

Eshe: Here, here I stand with the sun shining on my face
I, I'm so glad I made it through another day
Cause as tough as it's on
with me don't wait on no one You see
what will be will be
Make this moment count for me

Rasa Don smell the trees smell the land
smell the flowers and when you've finished then do it again
and hopefully when you're done
you'll realize just how much they mean to you Once you never be too busy
He can make a little bit of time to sit and think
the Almighty God up in Heaven's above will spread
(y'know) His Precious Love
