I-Hate-Ho-s:Poison Clan
[Verse 1: JT Money]
Hey yo!
Life's a bitch, so why marry one?
A nigga in love with a bitch is very dumb
The PC is hoe-haters
That's the motherfuckin' reason all hoes hate us
But I don't give a fuck, 'cause all a bitch
Good for is a suck and a quick nut
Tryin' to get a nigga' riches
But I got beef for ALL y'all bitches
Tryin' to run those sex scams
In a nigga' face, gettin' fucked by the next man
But I don't care about that either
'Cause all I wanna do is fuck, then leave ya
See, I know how the game goes
Yo - fuck y'all hoes!

[Chorus:]
I hate hoes. Hoes hate me. [chanted]

[Verse 2: JT Money]
Hoes try to run that love shit
The only thing you better love, hoe, is this dick
How can you love a mack?
The only way to love me is flat on your back
Or maybe FROM the back, I get ya sexed in
Tell you to step, and call up your best friend
'Cause I know she's a bitch just like you
If you're down, she can get the pipe too
See, it's all the same
To me, a hoe ain't nothin' but a fuck thing
But if a nigga disagree',
Then you's a hoe-ass nigga to me
If you can't strike 'em, how can you pipe 'em?
A hoe is a hoe, and yo, I don't like 'em
So fuck y'all!

[Chorus]

FUCK Y'ALL HOES!
[Verse 3: JT Money]
Stank ass hoes, I hate 'em
I get with 'em and slay them, and then I play them
'Cause they try to be slick
But all they get is a fight with a hard dick
See, the day I fuck you,
Dumb bitch, then tomorrow I duck you
'Cause you ain't got nothin' on me
And when I'm through with yo' ass, I'ma pass it to my homies
Madd Ball and Uzi, and let the boys
Wear out that lil' coochie
And if you start walkin' out
You must be the bitch that I'm talkin' 'bout
So wise up, hoe; it's In My Nature
To hate ya, so, fuck you!

[spoken: JT] That's right, fuck all y'all raggedy stankin' motherfuckin'
bitches and hoes 'cause I hate you. You heard "In My Nature, " you heard "The
Bitch That I Hate, " you heard "You Gets Nothin', " so don't come to me! You
fuck a nigga, think he gon' fall in love with you; you know I ain't with that
relationship shit! You ain't good for nothin' but a head and back massage,
and if ya get mad, fuck ya whole ass!

[Chorus]
