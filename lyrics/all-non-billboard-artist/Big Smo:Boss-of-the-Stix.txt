Boss-of-the-Stix:Big Smo
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix
I'm a big ten hustler with a true south swagger
Hillbilly balling count money on my tractor
With my John Deere fiddy cap made in the shade
And my throwback bravo boots, stomp in your way
Got the gay rap type like some square bale hay
I can pull about fresh hit the block and get paid
I own 32 acres of a dream come true
Bout a 100 head of cattle and a fishing hole too
I ain't hard to find, I be doing what I do
Out push hogging fields till my people come through
Living my life like an old dirt road
Sipping poke-brown out the jug, keep me ice cold
I'm a small town boy with some big city dreams
Let me drop a little something just to show you what I mean
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, king of, king of the country
K-k-king of the country, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix
Let me smash through with my K-5 Chevy
Banking through the Stix here to get my boat ready
Put some fun in the sun, get the party just right
Bonfire in the back cause we kicking all night
Racing cane like a devil kicking mud like a coolhound
Catch me by the creek and my backwoods camp ground
Thoroughbred gal with her deuce cut low
Going donkey on the boss like a smooth seated stripper pole
Shine' in my truck, got my eyes on the prize
Chunky-dunking in the water underneath the moon… light
Getting out living every day of my life
Southern swag in my blood, so to hell with a wife
Wild as a jackrabbit, slick as a fox
Country ass water milk served on the rocks
King of the dirt roads, watching you learn
Now put that in your swisher and let the truth burn
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, king of, king of the country
K-k-king of the country, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
Boss, boss of the Stix, boss, boss of the Stix
I'm the king of the country, the boss of the Stix
I came up like biscuits from scratch in the mix
