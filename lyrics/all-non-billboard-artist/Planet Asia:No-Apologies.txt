No-Apologies:Planet Asia
[Planet Asia]
This is that fly shit
Ladies and Gentlemen
Durag Dynasty
Champion belt holders, dolo did it
Without a hand out I'd still remain Polo printed
Speakin' of the golden era, God, you know we was part of that
My old flicks is like Abyssinian artifacts
A bunch of warnings we gave you but yet and still
You ride with 85ers and actin' like you're out of your mind
That's a Uncle Thomas behavior and furthermore my niggas ain't rollin'
So if you see us then y'all niggas should slide
I roll wit' maniacs, brainiacs, mainly wit' gats
Ayo Daddy-O, tell Shallah to meet me in Iraq
I part raw back, they got Gucci dashikis and all that
Right now I'm in the Philippines drunk rockin' a straw hat
Be back to the block soon, top noon
Runnin' wit' top goons, that's the type of shit that I'm talkin' 'bout
The tour is coming soon, for now we in the streets
Eating off land, prepare to go to war with a platoon, nigga

Little brother what's the science? You could
Come to the yard, I got you, we hood
Do whatever, light up the woods
We major fly niggas, garments is nothin'
Press a button, watch me light somethin'
I'm holdin' you back like you good
Grill cheese, egg, sixes waitin' for the sevens, you heard
Word to my mother, this is legend, a star home made barber
Touch the top, leave the edges shredded
Then it's laid out, fresh blow 'caine rhymes is ready
Know you glow, try to stay on point like swords
Don't ever underestimate the competition, this is important
I'm your brother, do it my way, the don way
Yves Saint-Laurent way, gimme your palm
The fire warm, Rae

Ayo Cotton Club, coco leaf
Age of the scared criminal
I'm never where the po-po creep
On the low plottin' the jux
The big shit only though
The homies know, they analyze
Watchin' me cook
This is my playhouse
Create a feature talent that's top rated
My shit bang in your head like gettin' your crop braided
Yeah like seven in a solid square
To only hustle we solemnly swear
With no apologies
