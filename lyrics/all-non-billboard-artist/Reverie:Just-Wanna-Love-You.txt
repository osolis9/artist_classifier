Just-Wanna-Love-You:Reverie
Baby, when you coming home?
I've been waiting all night
I just wanna love you
Kiss beneath the moonlight

Baby, open up the doors and come inside
There's no need to rush
We can take our time
Tell me how it feels
Tell me what you like
Baby, say my name
Say your love is mine
Bring me closer
Lets tear down the boundaries
I can sense you're free when you're around me
Spread my wings and fly in your direction
Stick your keys in- unlock my reason

Baby, when you coming home?
I've been waiting all night
I just wanna love you
Kiss beneath the moonlight

Kiss beneath the moonlight
Kiss beneath the moonlight
Baby, when you coming home?
I've been waiting all night
All night
Baby, when you coming home, cause I've been waiting all night
All night
Baby, when you coming home?
