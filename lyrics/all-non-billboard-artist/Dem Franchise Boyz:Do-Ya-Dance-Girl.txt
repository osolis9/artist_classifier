Do-Ya-Dance-Girl:Dem Franchise Boyz
Do ya on that hoe
First u lean and then u roll
Bind ya knees at touch ya toe
Beat none of ya know how to get low
doit like some Fa-bo
Bet u can't doit like me

Bind ya knees and rock ya hips beat u can't g it like me
Try to doit like me and watch ya legs get sore. (aaa!!!)
Bind ya knees and rock it 2 da floor
Ride and go a head and do ur dance
See this ur song girl so go head and do ya dance
