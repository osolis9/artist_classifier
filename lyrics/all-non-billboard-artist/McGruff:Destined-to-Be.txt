Destined-to-Be:McGruff
Herb McGruff, gat's in the beat
The richest black man on earth
Who gon' stop me? Fish scale for papi
Spots all over from New York to Utah

Salt Lake City, stay jiggy, cranberry eight fitty
Tented with BB's, stash box got three keys
Puffin' trees, lock on my knees for car jackin' thieves
I'm gettin' Lucci, Versace, Cucci, Gucci
Be loungin' like Luke be with wall to wall coochie

Uh, Gruffie, know your biggest dream is to fuck me
This Willie sip the bubbly, homicide's be ugly
For the record, I'm connected across the borders
Meetin' Bermuda blue waters on the celly givin' orders

Cream functionin', 52 states, I'm bumpin' in
Humpin' in, operation, flowin' and pumpin' in
Big Willie, Crystal, isle's and Phillis
Don't act retarded, I'm guarded by nine millies

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny, Prodigy
My theme is all about making the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably, Havoc

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny, Prodigy
My theme is all about making the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably, Havoc

I rest my ebony grill up in Beverly Hills
Smokin' Phills, listenin' to Stephanie Mills
Lifestyles of the rich and famous, all on anus
I'm in the spotlight who don't know what my name is

Life dangerous, police always puttin' me through changes
But in my spare time, I be at the golf rangers
Gruff, blowin' up with Mr. Big Stuff
The hamster, soul on soul, we on a roll

Explodin' platinum hits, cop catchin' fits
Got this rap shit, lock like pitch, niggas call it quits
For '96 and forever, I'mma get the cheddar
I keep it by the lever, sport my minks in cold weather

I'm well known, rockin' icy jewel stones
They be shinin' like stars from the twilight zone
You know my major, 1,800 sky pager flavor
Colombian connection, Don P, honey sexin'

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny, Prodigy
My theme is all about making the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably, Havoc

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny, Prodigy
My theme is all about making the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably, Havoc

Now who be that hundred dollar bills crispy?
Versace suit, slightly out the blaze, handkerchief be
Gator Morty slidin' through the party mad pissy
Champagne cooler filled wit Mo', Don and Cristy

Eyes low from the Dutch and hydro
When bubbly get low, what the fuck we rhyme on
I'm universal, gals love herb's style
Every now and then, mix my herb with tical

I run with real niggas who live life foul
My clan's off the hook, y'all soft and shook
Now look, we never talk, lives get took
Straight up crook, Gruff could never live by the book

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny, Prodigy
My theme is all about making the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably, Havoc

Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny, Prodigy
My theme is all about making the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably, Havoc
