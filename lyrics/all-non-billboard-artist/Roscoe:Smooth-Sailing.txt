et's go back go back the one yall love to flow back
i got five fingers and it aint no riddle why the only one showing
is the one in the middle... hey diddle diddle the cat and the dark are fightin'
over kibble in the back yard, i drink yak hard, yall act hard now i gotta
cut ya up like a Mac card, everybodies packin' and scrapin on all nobody wants to
scrapin an all... im old school with it, no tool wit head up till we fed up that's hard
(chorous)

i got the ladies sayin
hell i even got my mam sayin
east coast sayin
my big bro sayin

i show my g and fluid and all i do is spit fluid
im rollin' dep' and smashin i growin' up real fast and all i know is
flow and rappin. they call me young roscoe the philli fanatic silly spiratic
dippin in traffic grippin the matic'
sharp as a guillotine still a teen the california sun
just beamin as i lean pull out the cigarettes
feen if a nicoteen straight off the philly screen made for the philly scene
and a beam with my foot on the gasoline tell me im aint the fliyest mc youve seen
and it's all smooth sailin'
(chorous)

i get the club shut down with this thug style
i puff clouds and touch crowds what now?
sick wine strick nine runnin through my blood line

my heads spinnin like a windmeal rollin down the 101

(chorous)

hell i even got my sister singin
east coast singing
