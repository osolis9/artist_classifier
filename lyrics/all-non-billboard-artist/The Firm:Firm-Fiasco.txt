Firm-Fiasco:The Firm
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in The Firm
I can remember when I first met Sosa, it was a glorious time
There were wise guys everywhere
We were around twenty-one, twenty-two at the time
Yeah, every place we'd go, every party
People would stop and stare when we walked in

We give the doorman a hundred dollars just for opening the door
Sosa'd give the bartender two hundred dollars
Just for keeping the ice cold
Yeah we were legends, yeah and we still are legends

Two hundred fallen angels, we balling from every angle
Heavy bag gold, Panamanian changed angle let's tangle, tabernacles
Ill lukiens coming at you, fuck Parus
A billion years B.C., originally black Jews

Cashews honey now roasted, let's kill the colprate
He owes it, [Incomprehensible] with that four four bit
Fuck the hoe shit, mercury back tax the birth for me
Personally I existed when earth was in need, indeed

Human life form transformed from light storms
Poltroons, electrons neutrons, iced long
Nights long, reptilians, I'll see y'all in the next millennium
What world are we really in, amphibians moved to the Carribean

Underwater force, placed under the court of law
Usually sport Warlaw, my mind stay core raw
Fill of ambients, love fine carats and cars that launch
Nonchalant, usually there are Jimmies up in the palms

Play low style, Guteians change my whole profile
Left the dope pile, bet the guard be around for awhile
Firm Islamic, hit the corner of the earth just like a comet

See I like Esco, he knew everybody
And everybody knew him
He was the type of guy that routed
For the bad guys in the movies, but hey

Die for this Firm, live for this Firm
Niggas learn, never should come before your fame
From ki's to ported grams, these are corners in the blue van
E's upon on us 'cause of warrants
While we smoke hash cheese enormous

Stack cheese travel the world like Taurus
Went half with Sosa for four bricks
Down in Camden, we handlin' to D.C.
Chicks on fights with China White's by they tight PP

Wanting PC but all they get is good dick or four clips
For loose lips, by the jungle flise
Suck the pearl tongue juices, off you fly misses
Take her out to the Spark's stake house, gentlemen style

Coincidental, family's here
Meet fem fatal, French connection
Persian wet don, let's get this 'F' on
The Ebony Queen, Fox you grab my left arm

Dre made a QB the Canton, BK and so on
Family strong 'cause [Incomprehensible] in nature
Make it sure we all get this millionaire paper
What a sweet site for sour eyes, may we all rise
Hope for now on we never cross sides

You know what, most hoes would have
Left these cats a long time ago
I mean if your man gave you a gun to hide
What would y'all hoes do?
But you know, the shit kinda turned me on

Black Madonna, hoes kill for they popals
Never seen a bitch like this, queen misses
Rock BDS's on the left wrists, trick check this
Respect this, Firm niggas lie knee deep in this bitch

Wanna need bitch and have my pussy bleed, swear for 'em
Fuck and take the chair for 'em, whoever dare cross us
The thoughts that thoughts across a bitch's minds, pops the nine
Leave 'em resting in pieces, while my thorough bitches peep this

Death before decide-a, screw me on the dick-a
Lace me in Gabanna, peep dat, think I'm flippin' on these three cats
Set yo clown ass right up with my down ass
Bitch to hold the cash and G's, stash the guns for 'em

And the icedy E Berke, breathe the the sun for 'em
Long dick style, swallow the enemies cum for 'em
Pretty ass hoe, bitches fuck 'em and I dumb on 'em
When Nas pop the Crist, Fox cops the fifth
Make my doe up for OZ's, now hoes that's real uh
That's right
