Everything-Is-Yours:Kehlani
Up at a time when I shouldn't be
Thinking 'bout things that I shouldn't be
Sad about shit I'm sad about for the past year
I've been low, I've been down and out it
And it cost a few [?] with love and the [?]
I've been here and you know the times that I'm talking bout

(Oh, oh)
I would give it all to make it all work
(Oh, oh)
I wish I could say that you knew my worth
(Oh, oh)
End of the day, you was my first
At the end of the day, you'll know you're worse

I love you shawty, shawty
You know you my shawty, shawty
I need you to make me happy
There will never be nobody

My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (save it all for me)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours

Thinkin' bout your bed when I shouldn't be
Missing all that when I shouldn't be
You was on the road, I was on the road
We'd be back to back, back and forth
They know how it goes, know you got your pride
Just admit you hate being alone
Know you allowed to know
I'm sitting right beside your throne

(Oh, oh)
I ignored my friends, they ain't gon' make it all work
(Oh, oh)
But I just can't say that you know my worth
(Oh, oh)
End of the day, you're still my first
At the end of the day, I know you're worse

I love you shawty, shawty (you know it)
You know you my shawty, shawty
(You know you my shawty)
I need you to make me happy
There will never be nobody

My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (save it all for me)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (yours)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours (save it all for me)
My ring is yours (save it, for me)
Everything is yours
