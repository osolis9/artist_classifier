I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
my hood

If I was y'all I wouldn't come around here

I'd watch both pots cause they ain't from around here
Man stay with the stizzy cause I'm from around here

And not even the cops dare to come around here
So if ya hit the ambulance it don't come around here
Now ya stuck not even cabs they don't run around here
If ya hungry pizzaman he don't come around here
And I bet Jehovas Witness they knock around here
Whips get stolen they never gettin towed around here
Stay in the news, but never nuthin' new around here
If you ain't never been to the ghetto man
Don't ever come to the ghetto man

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
my hood

I heard there was a few people down there
Welfare made the rent a lil cheaper down there
Don't be slippin you'll get cut up and cheated with down here
For ya bling, even ya two way beeper down there
I got this bitch, mmm... she got a crib down there
I moved out while still get to live down there

You couldn't go down there to see ho around there
I you ever ask around there, I'll go down there
So don't go down there, in ya gold down there

Ya lookin for trouble even when ya stroll down there
'N ya whipped, popped at down the road down there

They don't play

Streets of war... hopes down there

Who ain't, hood prince still poor down there

been workin mighty hard 'til they old down there
'N they got a security guard in the store down there
But them kids are sellin me stuff they stole down there.man

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
my hood

Well I guess its the same everywhere
Come around iced-out n you get 'aight' anywhere
Fight to give it up or you get 'aight' anywhere
Most these people... they don't live anywhere
So every other night they just sleep everywhere
I tried to live that life but it ain't get me anywhere
I make my money here there but I can make it anywhere
Ask me bout me 'Suni', they respect me everywhere
Been in biggin' pop-down here there everywhere
Every block locked down here there everywhere
Guess they got fiends every block everywhere
'N they pumpin' Biggie 'n 'Pac every block everywhere
When ya lookin for the cops... u can't find 'em anywhere
Kids lookin for the pops 'n can't find 'em anywhere
'N their mama keep on switchin the creep down there

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
My, my hood

I tell 'em everywhere anywhere murder
What was really good
my hood

Is that your place?
Is that your hood?
Is that your block?
Is that your place?
Is that your hood?
Is that your block?
Is that your hood?
Yo...
I'll be there soon to a hood near you
