Tons:Natural Elements
[Mr. Voodo]

Natural Elements, the name of this topic
You should pay close attention how we rock it
When we drop the album and single, you should cop it

[A Butta]

Yo Voo, stash that, L hit em wit 2 Tons

[L-Swift]

Yo, first and foremost
Natural Elements serve a raw dose
You ain't hear the first time, so I return wit more dope
And I just burned some raw smoke, Voo else wit a? a-sand? Like a life-size statue of Elvis in Graceland
The fucker of jakes, they rush the gates
But all they find in my pocket was two dutchies, a razor blade, and some duct-tape
So if you're lookin for a cut face and broken jaw
Make you feel like you was locked upstate, and close the door

[Mr. Voodo]

Pope John Paul, I bless ill figures (reputedly)Dons fall when I caress steel triggers (rufusly)Anonymously, toss shots wit an ominous force night
Not know two MC's, draw guns wit two's a piece
Your whore's is chossin me, rap wars is losin me, a true MCMy influence be showing and fluently

[A Butta]

True indeed, I flows by properly hop
Go-go's coppin your spot
Yo whatever we drop, you know it's gotta be hot
Blazin, Raisin Hell like Run-DMC Sprayin shells till my gun be empty
I heard you want it kid, don't wait to tell, come and get me
Save your hit for A
