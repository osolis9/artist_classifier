The-Way-Live-Album-Version-Explicit-:Jill Scott
woke up this morning
with a smile on my face
jumped out of bed, took a shower
dressed
cleaned up my place
made me some breakfast
toast
two scrambled eggs
grits
grabbed my keys, grabbed my purse
grabbed my jacket, off to work
beaming all the way
down third
is it the way
you love me baby?
is it the way
you love me baby? (yeah)
4: 30
can't wait to get home
(oh jill, i know you're coming out with us tonight)
naw girl, i got something else to do
(aww jill, i know you're not gon' be frontin' on your girls, come on)
go 'head, really get your groove on
cuz tonight my man's coming thru
(awww, yeah!)

(well, that's cool, i understand)
as much as i like to shake my thing on the dance floor
i got a funny, nasty game in mind
(i hear that)

(ooooo, girl)
repeat
