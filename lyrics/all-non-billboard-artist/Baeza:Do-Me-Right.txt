Do-Me-Right:Baeza
Truth is, I'm really faded right now,
Truth is, I wanna get you naked right now.
To many shots, to many shots got my thoughts gone wild
I might as well just let my thoughts run wild.

I can get you naked, grabbing on the sheets
Get your heart racing, grabbing all on me
Gripping on your body, grind me to the beat,
Say grind me to the beat, grind me to the beat, yea

Oh, I got you in your zone, yea.
Oh, I love to hear you moan, yea
Oh, we on some other shit tonight,
Girl just do me right, girl just do me right
Oh, girl just do me right
Oh, girl just do me right
Oh, we on some other shit tonight,
Girl just do me right, girl just do me right.

Girl I can't see a damn thing, yea
So I'm just gripping on your damn frame.
Oh, you go me racing, for the finish lane,
But I'm gonna let you get close before a mile,
Ain't no rushing girl, got all of this time,
Go and do me right, go and do me right.

From the bed to the floor to the shower
Making love for hours, making love for hours
From the bed to the floor to the shower
Making love for hours, making love for hours

I got you in your zone, yea.
I love to hear you moan, yea
we on some other shit tonight
Girl just do me right
Girl just do me right
Girl just do me right
Girl just do me right
We on some other shit tonight
Girl just do me right
Girl just do me right
Girl just do me right

Truth is that I'm faded
Truth is that I'm faded
I just wanna get you naked
I just wanna get you naked
Truth is that I'm faded
Truth is that I'm faded
I just wanna get you naked
