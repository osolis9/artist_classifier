You-Say-I-Say:Mystic
thug niggas
drug dealers
y'all so caught in the game
you scared of love
what's that?

I was thinkin
you the one for me
I was hopin
you would set me free
how silly am I
how silly I am
you're not an angel
you're just a man
but I
I understand
you make me cry
and I smile when I can
this evil game
such a shame
lately
its all the same

you say it hurts too much to want me
thats what you say
it hurts to keep me
that's what you say
hurts too much to hold me
that's what you say
but if it hurts so bad to love me
tell me why you stay...
why.
I say I say
tell me why
I say I say
tell me why

why I'm lookin
deep into your eyes
I see perfection
I cant say goodbye
how strong is our love
this world is so cold
you sometimes act
like my tears ain't worth yo gold.
every time you leave
it hurts inside
still I let you go free
this twisted game
such a shame
lately its all the same

You say it hurts too much to want me
thats what you say
it hurts to keep me
that's what you say
hurts too much to hold me
that's what you say
but if it hurts so bad to love me
tell me why you stay...
why.
I say I say
tell me why
I say I say
tell me why

You promised me that you would never leave
