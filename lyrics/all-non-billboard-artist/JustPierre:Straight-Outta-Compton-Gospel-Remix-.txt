Straight-Outta-Compton-Gospel-Remix-:JustPierre
[Intro]
You are now about to witness the strength of knowledge

[Verse 1]
Straight outta Compton, a sanctified brutha seeking no fame
The name above all names is what I proclaim
Jesus Christ, Son of God, hold the codenames
Cooking like propane anything in close rang
Uh, Wilt Chamberlain with the post game
Team Jesus, crushing the devil's domain
But if loving our neighbor ain't the soul aim
We just making a bunch of noise like loose change
Hold the horoscopes, tarot cards, old sayings
This a call to repentance and the truth, man
To stop the will of God, you gone need Bruce Wayne
Usain Bolt and the Hulk, still will lose, man
I'm just exercising freedom of speech
With the hand I was dealt, tell 'em 'Read 'em and weep'
Declaring the Word of God, tell 'em 'Give me a beat
Give me a week', opposing what the enemy speaks, capisce?
I hope you get it, man, I hope you get it
Clique full of soldiers, call us No Limit
Loyal to the cause of Christ, man, we so commited
So persistent in Jehovah's business cuz we so addicted
To His goodness, we behold His image
Omnipotent, His glory overthrows afflictions
Isaiah 61, if you don't know His mission
Healing broken hearts and opens prisons of His hopeless children
He's given us His Holy Spirit and a strong conviction
To preach His Word to over millions and provoke repentance
I hope you with it, cuz I ain't stopping 
I preach the Gospel, coming straight outta Compton 

[Verse 2]
We just celebrating like it's grad nite
Living life, won't trip if this my last night
Cuz when I die I know that I'll be with the King
When I die I know that I'll be with the King
Name written in the Lamb's Book of Life
Inscribed in His blood, such a precious sight
My name in lights ain't on my checklist
Cuz in Heaven, my name is on the guest list
Uh, Heaven knows us, baby
So no it don't phase if radios don't play me
Riding out, just me and my team
Bending corners, yelling out, 'John 3:16'
For God so loved the world that He gave
His only begotten Son, believe on Him and you'll be saved
Took the pain and the shame for the mess that we made
They laid Him in a tomb, but He rose in 3 days, yeah
He came through 42 generations
To take away sin and to grant us salvation
So we sing praises in any given song
Live to know Him, die to make Him known, til He take us home
In sin, I was sinking way deep
Til the Master of the sea came and rescued me
My little sister told me, 'Keep preaching on them beats'
And at that Great Banquest, LORD, we gone feast
So I keep my eye on the prize
Lead me to the Rock that's higher than I
I lift Him high, and I ain't stopping 
I preach the Gospel, coming straight outta Compton

[Outro]
And that's how it goes in the city of Compton, boy
