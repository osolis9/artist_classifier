I-Salute:Tyrese
Black-Ty, it's time to show 'em the other side
You motherfuckers ain't ready

Sticks and stones may break my bones but
Words will never hurt, it won't work
So throw dirt on a nigga and watch me brush my shoulders off
I ain't sore for loss, I'm CEO, the boss

Think about it, he done went from this and that
And back and I ain't tryna rap and we ain't havin' that
Says who, you? You ain't got a clue what I been through
[Incomprehensible]

You used to be cool when I was on the R&B; side
Rap niggas is singin', I figured I give it a try
Can't be mad, you niggas never called me for a hook
The industry's shook, I'm Black-Ty, open the books

Steady reppin' the block, niggas know from Watts
Am keepin' it hot, the West Coast move won't stop
Straight out the do' fo' sho, got plenty collabos
You niggas sayin' you ready for the raft, don't make me laugh

I been doin' this rap shit for years
Blood, sweat and tears, no fears
So let me be clear, I got medicine for your ears
And naw, Dre didn't do it, shit is still hot [Incomprehensible]
I salute
