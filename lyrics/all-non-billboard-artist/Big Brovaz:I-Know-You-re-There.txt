I-Know-You-re-There:Big Brovaz
You take me to paradise and I feel
As though I'm goin' out of my mind
Can't you see, every time I'm with you, I feel weak?
Even though we're in a dream

Oh, I can't last a day without your touch, your kiss
Gently caressing my body, my body is only for you
Distant love, wish I knew how I met you
I know I shouldn't waste time wonderin'

Is it you who yearns when I touch your skin?
So gentle, so gentle, I can feel you
Tell me, tell me this is no lie
I see you in the reflection of my eyes
If you're not here, please tell me where

I know that you're out there
(I can feel that you are close by, you're here somewhere)
I've been waitin' so long for you
(Is life a dream, are things really what they seem?)

When I close my eyes you're here
(Yo, I wanna hold you if only I could show you)
Dreaming's not like reality
('Cause you're my destiny, girl, you know)
Need you too

Is this a curse or am I blessed? I think I'm going mad
Up in this cold world without my girl, I visualize her daily
Because I am feeling incomplete without my lady
I see things like her image, lurking in the mirror
I'm fantasizing, wishing she were right beside me

But realizing I am dreaming it's an illusion
So much confusion, I'm crazy about this lady
You haunt me, I have never met you
But I can swear to God, in my dreams, I smell and touch you
I long for you, wanna hold you when I am lonely

'Cause in my heart, you're the only one who knows me
If only I could manifest your very being
I could show you a part of me, no girl has ever seen
Believe me you're the only one in this whole world for me
I know you're out there so baby girl, just wait for me

I know that you're out there
(I can feel that you are close by, you're here somewhere)
I've been waitin' so long for you
(Is life a dream, are things really what they seem?)

When I close my eyes you're here
(Yo, I wanna hold you if only I could show you)
Dreaming's not like reality
('Cause you're my destiny, girl, you know )
Need you too

How will I know it's you
So many faces in the world
(Which on belong to you)
Would you pass me by
(If I don't say hi)

Please leave a clue
(I'll come find you and make our dreams come true)
I won't hesitate nor wonder
But please don't make me wait no longer
(If I had my way you'd be, here with me)
(I know it's destiny 'cause we we're meant to be)

I know that you're out there
(I can feel that you are close by, you're here somewhere)
I've been waitin' so long for you
(Is like a dream, are things really what you seem?)

When I close my eyes, you're here
(Yo, I wanna hold you if only I could show you)
Dreaming's not like reality
('Cause you're my destiny, girl, you know)
I need you too
