All-Night:Paulie Rhyme
She look so good, ahhh
Stay right here, all night
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ahhhh

Yeah, We gon put our suit in the booth
we gon put our suit on in the booth for this one
Yeah

Stay right here, all night

Now as the sun comes down, and we headed for weekend
Catch a few drinks with my folks before I back down,
You know the routine, happy hour with your peoples,
Put in work all week, now its time for the kick back,
Relax, step in right before the rush,
If you single, mingle, looking for the crush,
Im locked up, so I just head for the bar,
And I see that light brown, as pulling out my card,
Guiness, Fiddich, neat if you please,
Now I seen before but today she looking mean,
Kawaii mixed with a hint que belle,
Long hair, pretty smile, and nice lil smell,
The kind that make you give second thoughts bout your life,
Spend all your money, puppying dogging for night,
Know you not gon hit, not even gon attempt,
But if she did make a move, a brother might slip…

She look so good, ahhh
Stay right here, all night
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ahhhh
Stay right here, all night

Smell that cooking from a block away, work hard everyday
Still looking fresh though, beauty, grace, and gusto
Trendsetter in a league of her own,
Well traveled and well versed, and she know what she worth,
And I know much more so we roll like best friends,
Wheels off, through the end, on till the next life
Much more than a wife, more like a inspiration,
No need to get trife, turn'em down no hesitation,
So when I say I got a go, much more than some words,
Im on down the way, lay it down for the day,
Till we wrinkled in the face and our heads full of gray,
I got a full place, one Moto is ok,
As I pull to the stop and I head for the door,
Taboo in the front, other cat on the floor,
Everything in place, and the food on the stove,
My lady breaking a smile, couldn't ask for much more…

Now its early Friday feeling kinda buzz,
Got to grab me bite, try to soak some of this up,
Headed up Geary with some grub on my mind,
Should've stayed downtown, but cant deal with the lines,
And I got get back, man short on the time,
Left on Fillmore, right on Haight, see an open spot

She look so good, ahhh
Stay right here, all night
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ahhhh
Stay right here, all night
