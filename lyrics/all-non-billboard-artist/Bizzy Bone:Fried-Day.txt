No stems no, indo and chronic hydro that stinkin' and I can think of

(chorus)(same as first)

(verse three)

that
dont legalize cuz they know we can roll
gettin high just to get by
through all the suicides and homicides
and genocides drivebys walkbys gonna multiply
and chalk lines in the towns in the h-double-o-d hood
and it would rain
and it aint all were it aint all and it aint all and
it aint all good
I started at eleven stealin weed from coppers kreeper
and even though you beat us I gotta thank you for the
reefer
neva mess with white girls but I roll those white
boys
niggas come out the pen and they roll some tight
joints tight joints
my shit is swollen you shouldnt be rollin
livin on green leaves that will make your heart
bleed for the moment
just go and let me split up the weed and be silent
and sober
no jokin when the nieghbers door is open you want to
come over
we smokin smokin and now we tokin tokin and then we chokin
chokin chokin
chokin chokin chokin chokin chokin
I'm so high

(chorus)(repeat til end)
