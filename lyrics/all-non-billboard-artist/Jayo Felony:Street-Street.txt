Street-Street:Jayo Felony
Now, city 2 city, state 2 state
Country 2 country but most of all

I rock from street 2 street and alley 2 alley
While all you couch potatoes watch 'Ricki and Sally'
So all you so called players better hide in the valley
'Cause real G's put the killer in Cali, come on

I rock from street 2 street and alley 2 alley
While all you couch potatoes watch 'Ricki and Sally'
So all you so called players better hide in the valley
'Cause real G's put the killer in Cali, come on

I don't think none of y'all wanna test this
From bus tokens and transfers to Lexus
Never sexless, they all want the pipe layer
I come bang on that ass so I can get player player

The way that I operate will thrill you for days
To all my niggas turnin' green in the face from eatin' microwave
Meals, and I kill off a whole fuckin' race
Now I arrive to you and rock the whole fuckin' place

Hear me now, it's bully loco, baby
And if I could I'd play 'em all 'cause they skanless and shady, nigga
Don't put your hands on 'em, 'cause they lock that ass up
But they try to hold me down so I can knock that ass up

You got me fucked up in the realest way, or do I feel this way
You're quick to get knocked, while I struggle and strive
Throw up your doves and your E's while you're pumpin' this beat
On a Hundred and Fuckin' Loony, 'cause that's my street

I rock from street 2 street and alley 2 alley
While all you couch potatoes watch 'Ricki and Sally'
So all you so called players better hide in the valley
'Cause real G's put the Killer in Cali, come on

I rock from street 2 street and alley 2 alley
While all you couch potatoes watch 'Ricki and Sally'

E A Ski gon' keep bringin' the paprika to your speaker
As I fly over MC's and I watch em get weaker, uhh
At a club we come deep as the beat gets funky
Then I get tipsy off Hennessey and start feelin' on monkeys

Damn love, you're lookin' good in them tight ass jeans
To all my bitches writin' mad checks, for the finer things
As it comes through the door, I creeps up real slow
This ain't Joe, fools, I'ma be a player for sure

How ya like it, baby? How ya like it, boo?
How ya like it, baby? How ya like it? Player style
How ya like it, baby? How ya like it, boo?
How ya like it, baby? They say, she like it player style

You wanna make love but do you wanna wild thug fuck?
She wanna get fucked so like Luke, I put her in the bump
You can't take it so I'm laughin' as you cum to this beat
On a Hundred and Fuckin' Loony 'cause that's my street

I rock from street 2 street and alley 2 alley
While all you couch potatoes watch 'Ricki and Sally'
So all you so called players better hide in the valley
'Cause real G's put the killer in Cali, come on

I rock from street 2 street and alley 2 alley
While all you couch potatoes watch 'Ricki and Sally'
So all you so called players better hide in the valley
'Cause real G's put the killer in Cali, come on

Can't believe somebody tried to test this
Skanless fools just got me for my Lexus
Now I'm sexless and I wish I had that bus token
I know y'all niggas laughin', but fool I ain't jokin'

Smokin' the hump with dreams of livin' lavish like Donald Trump
While niggas go out like Willie Lump Lump
At least I know my main squeeze will be there for me
The way I lay the law down, she gots to care for me

Mr. Professional, I'm not an amateur by far
'Cause I leave the pussy open like, aah
I'm just a motherfuckin' real OG and ask my click, bitch
Fuck that pretty boy shit

You know, you wanna real nigga, that's strictly out to win
So now I like to drink Brandy 'cause we're best friends
Fuck your player style to this bomb ass beat
On a Hundred and Fuckin' Loony 'cause that's my street

I rock from street 2 street and alley 2 alley
While all you couch potatoes watch 'Ricki and Sally'
So all you so called players better hide in the valley
'Cause real G's put the killer in Cali, come on
