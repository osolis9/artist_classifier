Nasty Dancer
[Intro] 
Yeah get money 
Do what I want her to 
She dancer for money 
Do what I wanna do 

[Chorus] 
I'm your nasty dancer dancer for money 
Do what you want me to do (do what I what her to) 
I'm your freaky dancer dancer for money 
I'll do what you want me to do (do what I what her to) 


[Verse 1] 
Pass the salt shaker so I can make her 
Shake that salt all over my plate 
So you wanna get paid here the table though 
Put a legband on you a project ho 
Now drop that shit don't waste no time 
Ain't no rules could this be mine 
A high price ho with a body like that 
? much butt but I wonder what it shaped like 
Jam a jammy, jammy a jam 
All y'all tricks need to get with the program 
So shake it one time 
Let me see you stomp and grind 
Here a butt, there a butt everywhere a butt butt 
Booty all around I'm glad y'all found me 
Cuz I've been in a daze 
With all this pussy in my face 
Ow, so shortie what's up with that 
You wanna work gotta unzip your backpack 
And let me see you do the rabbit in the hat trick 
Cuz these niggas be lovin' that shit 
Don't stop, get it, get it 
Don't stop work with it 
Don't stop just get it 
Shake that shit don't stop work with it 

Chorus (x2) 

[Verse 2] 
It's her attitude that puts me in the mood 
Shit, shit, shit 
And it feels so right, it can't be wrong 
I could watch her do this all night long 
She's a fine girl but all the other girls 
All think she's a freak 
Gotta make that money honey 
Can't be livin' on the streets 
>From the front to the back, from the front to the back 
I didn't know she could dance like that 
Ooh she so nasty 
And I just might do anything she asked me 
Cuz she for real 
And she got my nature hard as steel 
But it ain't nothin' but a shake your booty thing 
I see booty comin' all out the g-string 
Let me see you in your birthday suit 
Baby gotta dance to get this loot 
So loose my money honey 
Let me see the little pink bunny 
Now when I'm in the club I'm in the front row 
I like to tip, tip, tip the hoes 
Niggas in the club sittin' all alone 
If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home 

Yes I'll dance (do your dance) 
Yes I'll dance (do your dance) 
Yes I'll dance, I'll da-a-ance (x2) 

Chorus
