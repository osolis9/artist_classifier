They ask if I'm a Christian?
I say, "is you serious?

This Giant Light of my will keep on Shining!
No matter what they think or say I'll talk about Christ!
They ask if I'm a Christian?
I say," Really Really."
The Gospel in my heart?
I say, "Really Really."
I look like I been Balling cause I'm really Balling!

Make them believe? I made them believe
Is Prime Wizzy Dope? I guess you can see!
I'm making progress like raking the leaves
I killed golaith just like David Did
Acheew! That was a blessing
I am too blessed, I will overstress it
I am no someone I think you should mess with the Lord on my side Holy Ghost can attest it
I can see peasants, they getting jealous
I think they should, they need to join us
If you can't beat it then join it stop living with poison
Just make up your choice and come in with the brothers
We ain't got no worries
we ain't got no burdens
If we get you bothered we will not be sorry
We fight for your soul all day
Even on Sunday so don't tell a rapper to shut up (shhh)
UNO UNO SEIS Please don't get up in my way
You ain't with Christ? Get out my face
All men in sizes, Life is a phase
After this life? Heave my base
People believe we all can't be saved
Me I believe we saved by Grace
Receive Christ, he is the WAY! Woo

I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no problems
You don't like my lifestyle? I ain't got no words
I bet my whole life man, Jesus Christ will come soon
Protected I need no Kong fu! The End is Close like 1, 2
Serving God we all want to, but our flesh make us to fall, True!
But your dreams will come true, if you study the word and pray in tongues too
Bros and Sis's he Loves you!
Do you know that he wants you!
The devil is a born fool
But Jesus CHRIST we run to
I say
UNO UNO SEIS Please don't get up in my way
