I'm not a fan of puppeteers
but I've a nagging fear someone else is pulling at the strings.
Something terrible is going down
through the entire town
wreaking anarchy and all that it brings.
I can't sit idly, no I can't move at all.
I curse the name, the one behind it all.
Discord!
I'm howlin' at the moon
and sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon.
Discord!
Whatever did we do to make you take our world away?
Discord!
Are we your prey alone?
Or are we just a stepping-stone for taking back the throne?
Discord!
We won't take it anymore
so take your tyranny away.
I'm fine with changing status quo
but not in letting go
now the world is being torn apart.
A terrible catastrophe
played by a symphony
what a terrifying work of art.
I can't sit idly, no I can't move at all.
I curse the name, the one behind it all.
Discord!
I'm howlin' at the moon
and sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon.
