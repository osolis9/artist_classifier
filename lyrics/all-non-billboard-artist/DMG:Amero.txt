Everyday we lose everything
again & again…
Everyday we get something
again & again…
Tell no one the place you gotta go
Nobody knows the way.
And it makes you runaway
Makes you Runaway.

People come and people go
again&again;…
Question come and question go
Like it goes past by me.
Tell no one the place I gotta go
Nobody knows the way.
And it makes me runaway
Makes me runaway.

Everything is movin' like a merry goaround.
Cool my heels before I lose my tears.
Everybody ask you but we don't know.
"Where're you goin'?"
"Where're you from?"
So, Where's the answer?

How many rivers do I have to cross?
Could I drop off? Could I drop off my bag?
How many rivers do I have to cross?
Where am I drifted? Where am I drifted away?
