Bustaz-feat-Edi-:Cablez
(feat. EDI (Outlawz))

[Intro: EDI (talking)]
G you wanna hit this? My nigga G
Outlawz... Mob Life

[Bridge: EDI]
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Can you handle the weight?
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Let me see that

[EDI]
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Ride or die nigga, can you handle the weight
My niggaz everywhere, trying to come up quick
And we full of hard times, ready to fuck up shit
From the block to the booth, slanging rocks are the truth
Nigga you got to do, what the fuck you got to do
For my peoples thats gone, and my peoples thats still with us
To them hustlers that love us, tell them bustaz to ill with us
Cause we the last of the realest
The truest niggaz left, Operating Under Thug Laws do it to death
It's a lot more than rapping up in the videos
A lot of hatred with drama thats how it really goes
So you wanna be a rap star nigga
You got to do more than just act hard nigga
Cause pressure bust pipes, and pussies pee on theyself
Cause they unable to keep it real with theyself

[Chorus x2: EDI]
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Ride or die nigga, can you handle the weight?
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Ride or die nigga, can you handle the weight?

[Cablez]
Ain't got no time for no bustaz, I only fuck with real niggaz (Outlawz!)
Like Outlawz motherfucker, you gonna recognize the Neen
I shall never ever surrender, to these bitch made niggaz
Cause snitches they get you got, and these bitches love to plot
I'm like these Young Blood niggaz, screamin' "we dont give a fuck"
I shake'em off like its nothing, you know the haters be fronting
Tell your mans Cablez on another level you cant handle me
And E-D up on it, you fucking bustaz dont want it
I put it down motherfucker, anywhere that I'm at
I'm not +Sigel+ but I can make the fucking +mack+ react
I'm not +Busta+ either but I can make the nines just +clap+
I'm nowhere near +Snoop+, but you can get +pimp slapped+
Ain't got no patience for haters, aint got no time for fakes
Niggaz think they want +drama+, but you not +Kay Slay+

[Chorus x2: EDI]
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Ride or die nigga, can you handle the weight?
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Ride or die nigga, can you handle the weight?

[Cablez]
I got that Mike Petty style, niggaz know how I get down
Go ahead and violate me nigga, you can get fucked up
I'm in these streets cousin, I see a lot niggaz fronting
When its time to get it on, you see a lot of niggaz hiding
Only real niggaz going to be around when the smoke clear
Niggaz not ready for the kid this year
I got a hustle game sicker than Vince Carter
Nah ma I'm not a baller but I can go to the whole harder
Nigga, I thought I told you that I'm ready for whatever
I got big shells, that'll rip through your leather
Decapitate your ass they can't put you back together

[Chorus x2: EDI]
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Ride or die nigga, can you handle the weight?
Ain't no room for bustaz, ain't no room for fakes
Ride or die nigga, can you handle the weight?

[Outro 1: Cablez (talking)]
Yeah fuck all you bustaz, niggaz hating on mine
Mob Life doing big things nigga
Outlawz, my nigga E-D what up hold me down nigga
Neen click that's what's up

[Outro 2: EDI (talking)]
Outlawz... til the day I die
Outlawz... til the day I die
Outlawz.
Outlawz set... til the day I die
