Stay-High:The Chainsmokers
You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind

High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mine

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
