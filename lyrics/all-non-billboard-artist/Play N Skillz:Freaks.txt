Freaks:Play N Skillz
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night
(The world has too many freaks)

(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night
I can freak you on the counter, freak you on the table
Freak you right now, 'cause I can't wait to freak you later

I wanna, lick, lick, lick you naw never that
To the bedroom give me head room
Straight to the point my time to clown
Let you know from the gate I don't go downtown

To many freaks that'll please me
I'm that playa you better believe
I'm payin' on cheese, but I guarantee
That I still got a freak everyday of the week

I love feeling when you dealing with someone
Pumping' them holes in your body all night long
My keep gets bigger when you giving me dome
And I get a little crazy when it's time to bone

Ma I like that you think that I was one of a kind
And my ice made you think that love was blind
Separate the greats, from the weak freaks
I would never hate, I love all my freaks

But I never bone, never let a hoe know that
I botta a lot of dough, she ain't gotta know
Take her to the room, I don't need your voice
But I might need your mouth to provide the moist

Didn't think you had it right till I met your needs
And swallowed my seeds and now I see
Why choose one freak when?

Idone been around the whole wide world
I done been so many places, seen many different faces
Met girls, girls, nasty girls
Real bad girls, chasin' this platinum world

And around, behind me and my shit
They say they really wanna get me high
They wanna spend some time
With a thug and get freaky with it

In a hot tub thuggin' gettin' weeded with it
We get P.O.D a little turn off the lights
Come over here, with me
Take off all your clothes, and freak me baby

You get's nothing from mayou just ah not a gucci, no prada
I holla at the chicks that I'm mackin' down
Hit then I pass it's a hand me down
Said I been around the world

I ah, been hated on for the things I got
But I don't come for man I just fuck the man
Talk real fine, then I fuck her man
And i love the girls that I bone, bone, bone
Call me up when she all alone, she good with the dome

She'll ride my le'll, she'll take my pride
She'll take my le'll you don't play I'm the playa to call
All you get is a little Cry-stal
Close tha you know my style
(Cense)

Coke bottle frame with a kodak smile
Straight with the cheese, we still got the beats
I'm straight to the point, I'm straight to tha sheets
Why choose one freak, when tha?

I took my T-shirt and my panties off
(Off, off)
I want you to freak me in tha morning
We can do it anywhere you like
In the shower, on the counter, every hour
