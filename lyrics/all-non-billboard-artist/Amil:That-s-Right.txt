Jigga man got Grammys so grams, cops cannot stand me
Ladies want me to put cock in they hot panties
Big man on campus, six sedan
Over 100 million made niggas shipped and scanned

Niggas cannot stop, knocking that big pac
Banging that big punch, poppin' my big gun quick
Run duck as soon as the gun bust
Forget where I'm from be coughin' ya lungs up

Robbin Hood in the big truck, pickin' the bums up
I never know when I can be down on my dumb luck
But the flow so tough I've been beatin' the drums up
Been hot so long like I'm heatin' the sun up

Wanna come up ones as I'm beggin' niggas to run up
So I can take this heat and bang you ta next summa

Don't make me come press ya wit' this fo fo, nigga
