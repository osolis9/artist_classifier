Accordeon:Ghostown
The morning rolled off me, as I downed a black coffee,
My vision stay misty, stay sticky like toffee,
My girl stays cross at me, cos I don't know the cost to be
I'm living this life, like this mission is lost to me
I'm 20%, still not paying my rent,
but im staying unbent, and I'm swaying on my fence
I'm undecided, at the place where I'm resided,
which the government provided, so why you try and hide it
I'm like 20, 000 under, every time I blunder, I wonder
when l'll light the sky up with the thunder
I'm singing "aye currumba" as I waken from my slumber
success is like the lottery, I pick a random number
so welcome to the twilight, I'm checking out the skylight
I'm checking out the nightlight, checking out my eyesight
deteriorating, lost in my own delirium
delirium, living inside the aquarium
so breathe in with me, and lets see where the story is
skip to the good part, and get to where the glory is
emerging victorious, that much is obvious
hard to be a real man, in this rap land misogynist
hard to keep moving as im walking through the boggiest
hard to keep moving as im walking through the boggiest of
waters, thinking of stuff you never thought of
stored in the back of my mind like some sort of
Art exhibition, with some parts looking missing
I'm talking to your mind, but there's just parts of you that listen
so hark what you spitting, as you sit and reminisce,
and I spark my ambition, and reload my ammunition
in the dark I will glisten like a poacher going fishing.
I spark my ambition, and reload my ammunition
in the dark I will glisten like a poacher going fishing.
I spark my ambition, and reload my ammunition
in the dark I will glisten like a poacher going fishing.
I spark my ambition, and reload my ammunition
in the dark I will glisten like a poacher going fishing.
I spark my ambition, and reload my ammunition
in the dark

Hold back when I'm waking, shaking up your dirty bacon
Paying double for your rations, mashing up your dirty cash-in fashion
Shows it when your faking, shaking fists up in my breaking patience
Don't you know I'm pagan, making bridges like a mason
Placing pieces on my chess board, gets more stronger by the hour,
tasting sweet and sour, shower spits upon my flower,
cower cover from the residents,
the kings and queens and presidents
bring me to and swallow whole
break my bones and lose control
to my roots im heathen, breathing life into the season
leaving traces of what I'm believing
traces of the gold I'm heaving
scheming from the world I'm bleeding
heeding no advice I'm needing
hearing that somebody's nearing
fearing that nobody's steering
