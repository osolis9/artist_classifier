Dress-Off:Phlake
Dress o-o-off
Heels o-o-off
Pass flo-o-own
Fast all alone

You make me grow old already
Just take that dress off dress off
You make me so sure
Please let me

I don't mean to be rude
but there's a couple things
I'd like to see you do
Bedroom studio

Slipping into your room
Oh no whimp as I go
Before you start the show
You set the tone oh oh

You let me go all the places
You made me so sure already
Now get that dress off dress off

You let me go all the places
Don't make me grow old already
I need that dress off dress off

First, roses and nothing else
Sent to the family back home
Diploma on the shelf
The lingerie tores the most

I know the gown stays on
While the hats in the air
Now you look oh so grown
With that smile in that brassiere

You made them so proud already
Now take that dress off dress off

You make me go all the places
The bedroom's so loud so ready
To take that dress off dress off

You let me see all the places
Make me so sure already
Now get that dress off dress off

You make me go all the places
You make me grow old already
Now take that dress off dress off

I don't need to interfere
I just need your ask to stay here
You let me
Sometimes you let me take that
dress off dress off dress off

You let me go all the places
You made them so proud already
