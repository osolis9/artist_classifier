For-All-Y-all:The Grouch
[The Grouch]
It's time to share I got enough to go around
so when you get yours, put it down
It's time to share I got enough to go around
so when you get yours, put it down (way down, put me up)
It's time to share I got enough to go around
so when you get yours, put it down.

Behold, a pale emcee
Judging like a book, everything you claim to be
I act on motivation, don't like to waste my time
I'm puttin truth in music, to stimulate the mind
Do not emulate my kind - or mistake that plusness for weakness
I'm observant - don't like secrets
I'm a servant with the deep dish
At times I'm speechless but I'll freak this to my favor
I'm your neighbor, your life savor, you're doomed
The smartest in the room at any given time
You have fantasies I'm living mine. out
That's what I'm about, the root of the route I'm taking
You used to the doubt and I'm breaking the mold

Yup, y'know don't be so greedy dog
Holding all the cards in your hand, y'know, share with your folks

It's time to share I got enough to go around
so when you get yours, put it down (down)
It's time to share I got enough to go around
so when you get yours, put it down (that's right)
. hook me up!

This is only one form, out of many
Plenty they are done for, but I'm not
What I am is power man, more than any
Rhymes are like a shower and, you are bathing
Sheep grazing, fools raising
heads up, "Mars Attacks" - we are fading
in and out of conciousness
Pa-rading around on some nonsense
Tell me why the contents kill me
Let me know why people at the bank don't feel me
Let me go really, let me go
Get your hands up out my pockets and your nose up out my window

You supposed to be my? you nosey motherfucker!

It's time to share I know enough to go around
so when you find out, put it down
It's time to share I know enough to go around
so when you find out, put it down

Y'know, hit me with some shit
Let me know when, you got somethin to tell me

If only for a second, I knew it wasn't just a dance
Dude had em checkin, they was lovin that my camps drew
real weapon, really steppin up for good
Somewhat sweatin cause they never understood, now I'm closer
Tomorrow more closer, rap vultures it's your roast
I hover around, pick at, take the best of what you're sick at
and reshape it, make it right call it mine
It's all in time you get your payback, stay back
and lay back and think, think before you speak
Lay back and think, before you speak

It's time to share I got enough to go around
so when you get yours, put it down
It's time to share I got enough to go around
so when you get yours, put it down
It's time to share I know enough to go around
so when you find out, put it down
It's time to share I know enough to go around
so when you get it, put it down
Put it down
Put it.
