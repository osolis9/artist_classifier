God:Nana
God is good, I never understood
All the darkness in his soul.
And God made man, the only way he can,
But for a heart he left a hole.

And it's killing you
And it's killing me too
Are we failing the truth?

I'm betting on desire, i'm betting on deceit
I'm betting on a moment when everything is sweet
I'm betting on disaster in every living hour.
Would you burn your fingers if you touched God?
Will he let you in if you have or not?

Once my friend, I loved you as a child
Kissed your face before I slept.
Be in my head, and with me when I sleep
In the bloodied tears he wept.

And it's killing you
And it's killing me too
Are we failing the truth?

I'm betting on indifference, i'm betting on belief
I'm thinking of a beauty where ev'rything's complete
I'm betting on a laughter, a very distant star...
Would you burn your fingers if you touched God?
Will he let you in if you have or not?

And it's killing you
And it's killing me too
Are we failing the truth in everything we do?
Are we failing the truth?

I'm betting on desire, i'm betting on deceit
I'm betting on a moment where everything is sweet
I'm thinking of the beauty I love with all my heart...
Would you burn your fingers if you touched God?
Will he let you in if you have or not?
Will he let you in?
