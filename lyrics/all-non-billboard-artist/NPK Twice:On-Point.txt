[Verse: Npk Twice]
Lot of mother fucker wana talk like they know me
Biting around the bush,don't act like you know me
I ain't kush,but your girl wanna blow me
When I blow I up she gon' act like she know me
On my own level nikker been lonely
Spit on a daily,ask your lady
Npk twice that's the man of the moment
Wasn't traveling but your lost in the moment
Could of gon quicker,blame it on liquor
Lemme switch it up... My flow is thicker
Speeding on nikkers they need to catch up
Was getting head Lemme Pull my pants up
You can keep ya Props I just want the fxckin' Guap
Few couple meals,couple of thrills Nikker's for that deal!
Few couple Meals,Few couple drinks the only time that u tap
Get a fucken Pen nikker and mark my words

Make the lines bend over nikker like aerobics
An you should stay in in-line like you want a fan pic
They lied my nikker yall ain't dope,spit terror a killer on the mic!
All you do is Boast,but I understand you wouldn't throw a dope line tossing on Zebra's man...

[Verse: Npk Twice]
I know one day that I'm gon' die so I'm preparing for a new paradise
Give my doughtter a real fatherly love
Your vision is blur you need a Pair Eyes
No fabulous but damn I flow nice
Got a tatoo on my right arm
Like uhhhhhh yeeahhhhh nikker look
Hitin' on me won't get you bread
Got a 9 Millimeter plus shoot you dead
My Stress level up to my head
She's your chick? Ugh take a dame
I'm an elevator I will eat your brains
Blowing steam like Saddam hosaine
Watch the news on a boom A rang
Fire works? Par horain
Call me Go Ku I'm the Super Sayan?
I'm the man what the hell you' sayin?
Call it a Gun while I call it a Toy
While I feel like Boy you tryna be Troy?
Me and My Homy Ghost on the beat when it comes to a Trap,kill and destroy!
Playing the Cassper Nyovest on a Trap
In my crib my girl is wearing a Bikini
Come any close and I swear to my God
My homy my home I will take off your kidneys
(Bah!) Swagger on point
Everything On point
Your girl on point?
My bars on point!
I'm Dee PDN

I'm an impacable linguist
Don't lie you can't defeat this
I'm ahead,while Getting head,while you nikkers sounding hideous
I'm crus ur lady like,I'm fina Strike,I'm anti wack
Your phone full of guy pics
Get a pen and mark my words
You want beef I'm goin Spurs
Go ahead paint ur nails
I diss you,your dead
You diss me,your still dead
Nikker death is inevitable
This is east vs west,defeating you ain't no biggie!
You nikkers cannot Curt This,and I ain't talking Fifty
Ima Meek Mill Your ass
Like ya hair style you gon' die!
This is a lyrical lesson,fresh bars like a new Cell
Your main? got no side chick
Call your fourth night your too weak!
Twice Killed Artizo and he ain't even raised a Bic
You should check my Match width,spits full of Dome Pitt!
Now I'm scouting ya casket cos you are dead nikker!
I'm a morden shake spears,these bars nikker shake spheres,scare pears,and cause tears
See how I treat you like my off spring!?
