If you're fallin' in love, let me show ya
At least a thousand reasons why
You should take your time
Before you fall again

If you're still in love, now's a good time
To wish upon the stormy sky
And take your time
Trust and you will win

So you got that lookin'
Like you lost your best friend
Said he didn't get to know you
Didn't 'ven get to see you
For all the beauty in you
You chose to set aside
You chose to compromise
Every time you saw the
Dangerous signs come crashing in

Ooh, we're so proud of ourselves
We're only human
There is lessons we all could learn

Oh, it's so hard to be alone
It feels so good to have a kindred soul
But it's better when it's on equal ground

Picks you up right on time
But he never seems to wonder
Never shows and interest
In anything about you
