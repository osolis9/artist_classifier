Another-Niguh:Sticky Fingaz
Who are you to question how I live
When the whole entire world is negative?
I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive
Keep my hustle in the street 'til the day I die

From NY, Southside where guns hide
Shells fly, eyed red, I'm dumb high
Got one eye, you get wet and hung dry
Leave you tongue-tied mothers watch their young die

Nig' you wan' die? Fuck a car through run by
I'll be waitin' at your crib for my money 'til the sun die
Six niggaz eat, divided off one pie
A nigga as ill as me is so hard to come by

Squeeze this rap shit 'til the well run dry
I never spoke to one time, not even one time
Look at my brain, it's every rapper combined
I'm 'bout to OD on some shit like Sublime

Who are you to question how I live
When the whole entire world is negative?
I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive
Keep my hustle in the street 'til the day I die

I'm just another face from a movie screen
A tough little nigga from a magazine
I said you're lookin' for trouble, if you want his cream
Remember everything ain't what it seem

Now can you feel me? Can you feel me?
Can you feel me? Can you feel me motherfucker?
Can you feel me? Can you feel me?
Can you feel me? Then get it right motherfucker

A'yo pass that, niggaz like that get blast at
Your life flashback, you was born out the ass crack
You mad wack, walk around with that gas pack
You get laughed at and asked that where the mask at

15.3 match that, coupe hatchback
I'm a class act, got assets, where the ass at?
I do you like I did them niggaz on the last track
We like dice, if you gon' roll don't ass bet

I won't rest in peace, even in my casket
Had the '03 hum' in '02 and I crashed that
I rap slash act, seven digits I cash that
Niggaz wan' dead the beef now but it's passed that

Who are you to question how I live
When the whole entire world is negative?
I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive
Keep my hustle in the street 'til the day I die
