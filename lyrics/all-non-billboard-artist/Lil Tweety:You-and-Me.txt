You-and-Me:Lil Tweety
Well its me once again
Baby girl it ain't the end
Hopin I can spend some time
Reminiscin' 'bout the last time you were mine
Baby girl it's you and me
It's what I wish to be
Once again together life one
And just imagine all the fun I would give
If you give me your heart
It makes me hurt cuz we always stay apart
In the dark I stay alone wit my back against the wall
Waiting for your phone call
See I gotta understand that you got another man
But I got to change those plans
Cuz I am here to give a helping hand
When you feelin we can a stand????
Call on me it doesn't matter what it is
All I want is a kiss
Cuz I miss being with you
It's true how I feel cuz I will fight for you
Just to make it right with you by your side is where I wanna be
And you ride???
You and me like a perfect team
Baby girl just you and me as one having fun

I just want to know will
it ever be
the way it was before
just you and me
If I get with you (You and me)
will you be true (You and me)
Cuz I want it to be just you and me

There ain't no other in the world
That can love me the way you do
I know I made you cry but I am sorry for that
Cuz what we had was so good
When I was in that hood
You were at home waiting for me
You never even tripped when I came a little late
Even though you had to work
You still showed me love
You are like an angel from above that I had to take care of
Cuz you were my girl and you were part of my world
I want you back in my life I need you girl for a wife
I know that I am younger than you
But that's okay it shouldn't matter anyway
You told me that you love me and I told you back
I will never cheat on you remember when I told you that
Now give me something at least
Forget about the rest
Me and you together we were the best
I know you heard so many things about me but it's not true
Cuz my love and my heart is waiting for you

I just want to know will
it ever be
the way it was before
just you and me
If I get with you (You and me)
will you be true (You and me)
Cuz I want it to be just you and me
If I am with you
Will you be true
Cuz I want to be just you and me
If I am with you
Will you be true
Cuz I want to be just you and me

Well it's time for me to go
And I hope that you know
I will never leave your side for as long as I live
It's me that you can call on
How long do I have to wait for the day you will be mine
Time is running short but I will always make time up for you
And it's true the way I feel every day I keep it real
Hoping that you still love me
Always thinking of me
Put no one up above me
See I gotta understand that you got another man
But it gotta change those plans
And I wonder what you think about me
It's plain to see how I feel inside
I need you next to me
So I can hold you tight and I will never let go
Baby girl I just want you to know
I will be here when the other one ain't there
I wanna get so close to you and get the most of you
Cuz that's want love is supposed to do
And every night I think about you

Yeah girl (You and me) every night I think about you (You and me)
Ever since that day we split up you had me thinking about you
You know we went through a lot of problems
when we were younger, you know
I am still waiting for the chance
You and me is what I am hoping for
So when you feel it in the heart let me know
I'm out

I just want to know will
it ever be
the way it was before
just you and me
If I get with you (You and me)
will you be true (You and me)
Cuz I want it to be just you and me
