[** Crime Stories (Album):]


{*Nino Brown laughing*}

[Slow Pain: {Nion Brown in Background}]
Say, hoe (Yeah, yeah, one, two, one, two)*
What the fuck (Check it out)
Why you always pagin' me 69
911
You know my homies come first
And they comin' first right after my money
Cause you know my money comes first
The homeboy, then the pussy
That's how it goes on this side

[Verse 1: ~Nino Brown~ {Slow Pain in Backgroun}]
I knew this freak
I think her name was Mona
Nasty little hooker from Phoenix, Arizona
At the Super Show
On stage with a G-sting
Bet she get first place, then she got a purty face
Big ass chest
Five thousand dollar ones
But that's okay
I lick 'em anyway
She came backstage with
Fine ass friends
I got five, they was strippers cause they rollin' in the Benz (Benz, biotch)
I said, "What's up, mija
They call me Nino
Good to meet you, hoe, I mean, trick
Cause I know you sick a duck"
I'm just teasing you
Why you go and look like that
She said, "She do
Anything for a backstage pass" (Ha ha)
I'll be right back, Slow Pain said he want some too (Right)
I told him, "Cool"
And we go again on a rendez-vous
Super Freak Mob
And you know we pimp like that
And Mona said she wanna ride my dick like that (Like that)
I told her, "Hold up
Wait
Before I sign your tape
Room 113
Be there, be square
And bring a friend too
If that's alright with you"
Super freaky Lil' Mona said she do that too
And that's some good shit (Biotch)
It turned me on like that
She said, "Papi, I'm the freakiest you ever gonna have"
I said, "Oh no," I
Really, really, doubt it
I bring the candlewax, you could tell me all about it
Super freak

[Chorus: ~Slow Pain~]
Super, super
Freaky, freaky
These are the tales that I tell so well
Super, super
Freaky, freaky
These are the tales that I tell so well

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2: ~Slow Pain~]
I bumped into this super freak from East L.A.
Met her at my homie Lil' Blacky's party
Took her for a ride in my '98 Lex, so
Ecstacy had the hoe thinking it was a Benzo
Late, late, park in the dark Lakeside
Cold Aliza had me feelin' all right
Parked my big Caddy in the mansion near the bush
All I could hear, was "Ay papi, just push"
Pimpin' ain't easy, but it's easy for me
Tilt back my leather seat, now she slow riding me
Finger on the titty and a finger on the clit
Finger up her ass cause Slow P be the shit
Nasty as I wanna be, sixty-nine reasons why
I'm a be a motherfucking pimp til I die
Took the bitch home, and the player got a page
Another pussy call, but this one's from out of state
Ontario Airport, Denver, here I come
This bitch named Monique
Hoe got me on the run
Checked in at the Hilton
She waitin' in the lobby
Why she wanna fuck me
Baby, just bob me
Hit the cat all night
Caught a flight in the mornin'
I guess you could say
Slow Pain be so horny

[Repeat Chorus:] (2x)

[Slow Pain: {Nino Brown in Background}]
Hey, you know what, hoe (Say what)
Next time you page me (Yeah, you know she)
69911 (Super, super, freaky, freaky)
You better make sure your sister (Yeah, yeah)
And your cousin with you (Don't stop, don't stop)
Cause I ain't fuckin' with you no more (She super, super, freaky, freaky)
I don't give up one of my boys, Nino B or (Say what)
Somebody else in the Super Freak Mob
Cause I'm tired of your shit (She's super, super, freaky, freaky)
And you know me, I'm always lookin' for the new shit, the good shit (Ha ha, biotch)
The shit that make me free
Tired of making you yell and moan and all that
Where my money at
Where my money at, fool
Biotch
