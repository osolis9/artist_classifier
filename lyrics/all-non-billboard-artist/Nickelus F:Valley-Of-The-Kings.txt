Valley-Of-The-Kings:Nickelus F
This is the valley of the kings
Valley of the kings
I should have been Egyptian
Just look at all these yellow clothes
With the pyramids and every dollar that I am spending
valley of the kings
.. re-emerge from the flames . now I am the pharos
I moved out Cairo .. we were inspired by .. desired and dreamed
.. I bet you all want those I let you all come close
All that Samaritan .. you were expressing .. for our exotic women
We are in the valley of the kings

Chorus
This is the valley of the kings
Valley of the kings
I should have been Egyptian
Just look at all these yellow clothes
With the pyramids and every dollar that I am spending
valley of the kings

hey my city is like Mesopotamia
before was the kush we twisted and blew the ..
we all move like Gods
all pray when we are on the scene
.. but a bloody Mary is not scary ..
The summer is mine but I keep in 100
Cleopatra .. the apple of my eye
Sing a lullaby
Say that’s what you are
That’s your new name
I call you sexy
We are on the valley of the kings

Chorus
This is the valley of the kings
Valley of the kings
I should have been Egyptian
Just look at all these yellow clothes
With the pyramids and every dollar that I am spending
valley of the kings
