Godz-Handz:Young Noble
[Intro]
Yo... yea...
We already sketched out in ya history books
Pac made sure of that (Pac & Yak)
That's what you call destiny
It's like we in Godz hands ya know
Whatever's gon' happen, gon' happen
So don't worry about me -- worry about you
We alright

[Verse 1]
Aye yo...
It ain't no way out -- Nigga
So we stuck in everyday out -- Nigga
The heat tucked
From my birthday -- March 21st
In the worst way -- I feel I've been cursed
Cause the world heavy
And I'm only a buck-70
Makaveli was telling me to duck them fuckin felonies
I gotta feed my family
The man of the house
So why the fuck you niggaz think I wont run in ya mouth
What it's about?
Hoes and dough?
Clubs and shows?
Thugs and hoes?
Nigga fuck my foes!
I'm on some Outlaw shit until they bury me six
Smash for Pac and Yak
They started this whole shit
The Lawz don't die we just spread the love
And we shed blood for dead thugs
Outlawz don't die we just spread the love
And we shed blood for dead thugs
Sing with me...

[Chorus]
Outlaw Recordz
We ball or die
It's in Godz hands now
We gon' fall or fly
(sing with me now)
Anybody think they stoppin' it
You all could try
Everybody here bleed so we all can die

[Verse 2]
Yo...
For my nigga Yak
We the hottest right now
For my nigga Pac
We gon' lock shit down
For my nigga Al
We gon' sew the whole game
For my Greg Brown
I make the world feel my pain
For my nigga Ceddy
Imma always stay ready
For my nigga Sieke
And all the legals will believe me
For my Grandma Marcy
We ain't neva gon' stop
And for my Grandpa Allen
Every plan gon' pop
For my Mustafa
Imma stack a few dollaz
For my nigga Chu
Imma show you how I'll do
For my Aunt Dee Dee
I'm makin' sure you can't see me
For my Nico Storm
Dawg it's on til they free me
For my Miss Reeves
Imma show no fear
We got angels down here
And family up there
For my cousin Darren
Imma show no fear
We got angels down here
And family up there
This is destiny

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a son now
So I put the gun down
Pick it back up
Cause there's always one clown -- tryna test us
Thinkin' niggaz ain't down
Niggaz stand up
Just to get shut down
All the hard living
We already been through it
Thinkin' God sent me
Just to make thug music
Picture my history
Dealing with destiny
We in Godz hands now
So just let us be

[Chorus]
