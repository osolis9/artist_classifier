The-Reason:Funkoars
Find me around the last house on the left
In a car, with a dark figure, cigar and hard liquor
Harbinger, bar spinner, far sicker, fightin em
You aint up to par with this hard hitting bastard
This after charred remains, the basket case who cant remain
With half these names just after fame
Park ya fame in the corner, ya shake
You lookin like ya bitch period late
Last behaviour, duct tape and taser
My flavour, laughin at the deaths in the paper
Your saviour, role model, creature, teacher
Sendin motherfuckers to ether
I'm feelin like fuck this, fuck that, fuck him, fuck her
Fuck the beats, of course, fuck the world aye
I got a bitch slap for everyone who want it
And this is the pure product

We the reason you quit, we the reason you spit,
We the reason you aint worth shit
Cant believe the thought or fact the Oars are back
We the reason MC's leave peaceful
We the reason
We the reason
We the reason ya crew aint shit
We the reason
We the reason
We the reason ya crew aint shit

My broad slam, the fuckin face of your Fam
Like give up that walkman now walk man
Now you half steppin in the mine field
Full of blind rappers and past efforts
Of veterans ideals
Theres no hidin, the odds of surviving
A drunk drive grindin with five cunts piled in
Spin, hit the island, bright lights to walk toward the hospital ward
Where they lay silent
Bright lights to walk toward they lord
Driver escapes unscathed and walks from court
I'm from the place where they expect me to be
An excessary to a fetal bashing excessary
But fuck it, I'ma go against the grain
You know the name, I'm the picture of health
Stuck inside a broken frame
A Funkoar, pissed on this binge drinker
On my bucks night stickin bitches with my ring finger

We the reason you quit, we the reason you spit,
We the reason you aint worth shit
Cant believe the thought or fact the Oars are back
We the reason MC's leave peaceful
We the reason
We the reason
We the reason ya crew aint shit
We the reason
We the reason
We the reason ya crew aint shit

Who wants to battle, I'll leave you face down in a dark alley
Look into the eyes of death through a blood stained belly
Hack the women 'till the hatchet turns red
I wont let you die, I'll show you things worse than death
Ice pick to the knees to take out the two limbs
So the ligaments trail out the back like loose shoe strings
And this is how we do things on a blood stained pavement
This aint Wes Craven I'm the right hand of Satan
This aint the main stream, this some dirty back corner
We on top of the food chain, crowned the kings of this rap order
Think that aint true, that's some funny shit
I only rock shows to find a pretty bitch to bump uglys with
Hon's some scummy shit, brush the crum from my shoulder
And use my nuts to paint ya girls body like a whole car
Get them hands up like David Blain made em levitate
And make some noise for the Oars, Australian hip hop heavy weights

We the reason you quit, we the reason you spit,
We the reason you aint worth shit
Cant believe the thought or fact the Oars are back
We the reason MC's leave peaceful
We the reason
We the reason
We the reason ya crew aint shit
We the reason
We the reason
We the reason ya crew aint shit
