Standing behind the mutherfucking trigger
Making them dollar on the hour

Making them hoes scream and holla

Puliing triggers

And all you buster ass bitches can suck a fat dick
You see, I gives no love to no bitch ass fag

Slanging nothing but rock
Cause I'ma bad ass nigga
Holding with a tech
Now you'll never catch me slipping
My old lady pack a fucking nine
