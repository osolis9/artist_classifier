Vulnerable:Tinashe
(Verse)
Once upon a time I was all alone
How you like me now? Do I turn you on?
Now that you’re drunk I can get on the pole
Show you what you want, give you what you want, want

(Verse)
Have to make you mine, get you on this ride
Yea, watch me go to work, I’ll put on a show
Now that you’re drunk I can get on the pole
Show you what you want, give you what you want, want

(Chorus x2)
Don’t stop looking at me
Don’t stop looking at me
Don’t stop looking at me
Don’t stop looking at me

(Verse)
These niggas ain’t mad about it
These niggas ain’t nothing to worry baby
You got it got it
The way you run this shit, go big baby
Sure will
My berkin bag, banky bank
Hotel…
Oh dear

(Verse)
You know what?
I’m that crazy motherfucker form the dust
You’re the angel out of hell from the cross
Independent on this world, we attachin
Man I love when yo ass start to fuss
And that crazy little face for you cussin
You love a crazy ass, he’s a nut head
Put one hand on my elephant tusk
Hand on her mouth, no you ain’t gotta say much
Fuck then she more, get the loud
Shut the fuck up!
That’s right nigga and I can’t get out it
You said and then she can’t figure it out
I hate the deep end just so I can snap it on
I want straight in that genital, I’m thinkin about er
Bitch stop thinkin that we hung up
Bitch keep lookin at me

(Chorus x4)
Don’t stop looking at me
Don’t stop looking at me
Don’t stop looking at me
Don’t stop looking at me
