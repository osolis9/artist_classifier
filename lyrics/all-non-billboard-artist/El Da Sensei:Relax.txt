Sit back, relax,

Do you believe in yourself
Coz I believe in you
I'm gonna be there by your side
And get to do what you gotta do

You wanna be your own man
Shake the world with your bare hands
Gotta have the best of it all
Be proud, and stand tall

No mat-ter what you
No matter what you say
Things won't go your way
So when you're mad at the world
And all your feelings are hurt
Do't let it getcha

Just take it easy babe
It's all gonna be alright
Just take it easy baby

There's nothing greater than you
Because heaven said it was true
And I'm gonna pray every night
To make sure we got it right
You wanna do what you can
Work as hard and come to no end
You gotta prove to them all
You're alright - Ain't nothing wrong

No mat-ter what you
No matter what you say
Things won't go your way
So when you're mad at the world
And all your feelings are hurt
Do't let it getcha
