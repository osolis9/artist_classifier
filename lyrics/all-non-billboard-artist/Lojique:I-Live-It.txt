I-Live-It:Lojique
Chorus:

I live it, you can't get around this
So sit, as I hit every target
(repeat)

Verse 1:

(Nickels)
I hate petty church games, don't front
Live the lifestyle, don't even act like the stunt
Who tries to fit in, pathetical compromise
Open up your eyes to see, that you can be wise
And not just some church kid who owns a forgotten prophecy
Taught since youth, you've known this since infancy
Head knowledge ain't jack, abide in Christ
And He'll abide in you, make that sacrifice
To live a life for a God bigger than you
A God much larger than you, be a man, I challenge you
Prove me wrong, unless I'm right, and you don't care
Aware but unaware of the dangers everywhere
Thin ice, no joke, catch on fire, melt
And take a swim in Him, you know what's happenin
You can't tell when you're out, don't take the route
Where before you're X'd out, you plead the blood, please

Pre-chorus:

What you want now, what you want now
What you want now, what you want now
What you want, what you want, what you want, what you want
What you want, what you want now

(repeat Chorus)

Verse 2:

(Ohmega Watts)
Are you a solid or a liquid, I veer towards liquid
Unstabilized minimizing time which now ticks away
Attributive display towards Christ, hundred percent
I maximize my ability for rhyme to be efficient
Why is it that you live unbalanced not accepting the challenge
Sporting Christ and sin out to spiritually damage
The body, formulated to support one another
On a thin line, playing two sides, undercover
This life, but a vapor of smoke, you might choke
On the exhaust pipe that the worlds pro life, what a hoax
I mean this in love, return to Him the First and Last
Author and Finisher of future and present, don't become past

(repeat Pre-chorus & Chorus)

Verse 3:

(Othello)
The original plan was not to have religion
But intimacy, through you transparently
Show nothing, spineless mortal man with foolish plans
To rule the world, cash money, bling bling, I find it funny
How you're dumb, ignorant bliss persist to rock your knot
And block you from heavenly thought resulting in spiritual walk
With God, martyred for the sake of your facade
Haunting your offspring with gnostic influence

(Page One)
This can be earned but not bought, learned but not taught
The only profession where you can get burned if you're not hot
I got the recipe to rip into beats aggressively
Rugged at the same time smooth like a luxury SUV
But not nearly as trendy with the upper class
Suffering succotash, I'll break your continuity like a double dash
Struggled through a troubled past
But wherever I blessed the cipher I "8" heads without the duffel bag

(repeat Pre-chorus & Chorus)
