Baby-Brother:Sticky Fingaz
Let me call this nigga
Come on man, pick up the damn phone
Hello

I got your pictures, damn, we look just alike
A younger version of me, half my age and height
I played, 'Beat you up', made you tough, taught you to fight
Put you on, showed you things, put up your first bite
Now you on the streets making the same mistakes I did
That got me nowhere, so I'm trapped upstate in this bid
Caged like an animal ain't no way to live
Got a baby on the way, who gone father my kid

Where you going now I can clearly see
You either going in a [Incomprehensible] or in jail with me
Remember when we was younger and you promised me
You be the first in our fam with a college degree
I know you see the cars, the girls, the clothes, the jewels
And think it's all about the money, heard you dropped out of school
I ain't trying preach but if I don't, who gonna
Couldn't live with myself if you died on the corner
You're my baby brother

You are my baby brother
And you know I love you nigga
I'm just trying to keep you out there
You don't want to end up in here

I hear what you saying big brother, but listen to me
I ain't trying to be the nigga working Mickey D
When I can hustle on the block and come home with a gee
Yeah, you right I want jewels and push a luxury V
But what's wrong with that, I wanna love comfortably
Just like the next man driving 'round the hood in my Lex Land
I ain't got nobody taking care of me
And as far as a school, well, it just ain't for me

So what you wanna do?
What? You gone sell drugs all your life?
I might
You see, you ain't even right
Maybe when you sober up your ass to see the light
Hold up, this is my life, I live it anyway that I like
Yo, look I'm just trying to help
You know all you want to do is get blunted
I need money, my wifey got a seed in her stomach
If you can't see the cycle then you must be blind
And your child getting a father that was just like mine
You're my baby brother

You are my baby brother
And you know I love you nigga
I'm just trying to keep you out there
You don't want to end up in here

So is you like that, I mean what's the deal?
Don't you too worried about trying to keep it real?
Man whatever, this is how you feel then this how you feel
And yo, what's this I hear? You had a gun concealed
Yeah, I keep my nine
You know what, let me speak my mind
Look at you, you can't talk, nigga you doing mad time

Yeah, look at me, this is how you wanna be
Locked up, the cops tell you where you can pee
I got to go, man
Oh, you don't even want to hear me out?
Yeah, but you talking mad shit I don't even care about
All I saying is that you got to be more responsible
Aight man, whatever, I'ma talk to you
Yo, yo, damn
He gone end up just like me

You are my baby brother
And you know I love you nigga
See, I'm just trying to keep you out there
If you don't want to end up in here

You are my baby brother
And you know I love you nigga
See, I'm just trying to keep you out there
If you don't want to end up in here

You are my baby brother
And you know I love you nigga
See, I'm just trying to keep you out there
If you don't want to end up in here

My baby brother
All I got
You're all I got
