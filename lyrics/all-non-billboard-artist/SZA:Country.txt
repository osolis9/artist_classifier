This here’s the epic tale…a broken mind
This here
This here’s the epic tale, a broken mind
This here
This here’s, the epic tale
This here’s, the epic tale

I, I’ll be by your side
And I’ll, be by your side

I hear my thoughts, I hear them clear
Into my mind, into my dreams
Who is this in my head, save me
Untie my hands
Untie my feet
So I might fly away
So I might fly, I might fly

This here’s the epic tale, of a broken mind
This, this here’s the epic tale
This here’s the epic tale of a broken mind, ohhhh
This here’s the epic tale
This here’s the epic tale of a broken mind (broken mind)
This here’s the epic tale (epic tale)

I, I’ll, be by your side
And I’ll, be by your side

Like clouds under my feet
I’m trying not to sink,
Not to feel, like I’m stuck
In this space, I’m just me
I’m just so much more
So much more, so much
I’m so much more
I feel I’m so much more

One day I’ll tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I’ll live to tell the tale
One day I’ll tell the tale of how I lost my mind (one day)
One day I’ll live…
One day I’ll live to tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day if I live
One day if I live, I’ll tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day if I live…

I, I’ll be by your side
And I’ll, be by your side

I’ll be, I’ll be, I’ll be, I’ll be by your side
Won’t go nowhere, I’ll stay right here by your side
I’ll be, I’ll be, I’ll be right here by your side
Won’t go nowhere, I’ll stay right here
Be, I’ll be, I’ll be right here by your side
Won’t go nowhere, I’ll be right here by your...

Lost my mind
Can’t seem to find it, but I’ll be here
But I’ll be here though (but I’ll be here though)
