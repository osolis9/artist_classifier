You-Drive-Me-Insane:Sandman
There was a time when we were together
When I thought that it would last forever
Everything was so perfect
Untile the moment you just left

Darling hear me
Can't you see?
I need you
You're the only true

When you walk away
You Drive Me Insane
Without you a day
You Drive Me Insane
Why wouldn't you stay?
You Drive Me Inasne
Yeah You Drive Me Insane

Will I ever see you again
When my life is just bane
All of your steps are echoing in my head
I will never forget the tears we shed

I want you to be mine
That makes my life fine
Do I know what you
Were for my life?
Yes I know!

When you walk away
You Drive Me Insane
Without you a day
You Drive Me Insane
Why wouldn't you stay?
You Drive Me Inasne
Yeah You Drive Me Insane

Come to me
Whisper your answers to the wind
Where will you be?
Here in my mind

When you walk away
You Drive Me Insane
Without you a day
You Drive Me Insane
Why wouldn't you stay?
You Drive Me Inasne
Yeah You Drive Me Insane
