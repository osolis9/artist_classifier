This-Kind-of-Lonely:Everlast
Sittin' alone at night, rain fallin' on my windowsill
Just wanna do what's right but I don't know if I ever will
There's so many reasons, too many excuses
And all these prescription, got too many uses
I'm so lonely, it's kind of scary
This kind of lonely is makin' me weary

I'm so lonesome I could die

Sittin' alone at night waitin' for the sun to shine
Sometimes I kneel and pray hopin' someday that you'll be mine
Girl, she's so many miles away and I got so many things to say
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway
'Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty
This kind of lonely makes it easy to tempt me

I'm so lonesome I could die
I'm so lonesome I could die

Sittin' alone at night, waitin' for somebody to come
Think if I up and died wouldn't nobody notice at all
'Cause I'm so insecure and I feel so unsure
Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before
And I'm so lonely, I feel like cryin'
This kinda lonely is worse than dyin'

I'm so lonesome I could die
I'm so lonesome I could die
I'm so lonesome I could die
