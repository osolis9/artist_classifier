Chills:Fatty Koo
[Verse 1]

[Valure]
The sunlight smiles
Faithful everyday for you
No one can come close to the
Joy you bring to me
Whispers like a summer breeze
To put my mind at ease
When I look into your eyes
I envision you and me
On love's journey
So I wrote this melody
To show you that you send me

[Chorus]
Chills running through my body
Shivering down my spine
Keeps me queering for you
So happy that your mine
I'm shaken, I can't control myself
Cuz you
You send me chills

[Verse 2]

[Josh]
Come whisper in my ear
Tell me what your heart desires
Girl I feel that youâ€™re the one
That I could spend forever with
You give me that sensation
That no other love can give
[Valure]
Boy what you do for me
Goes far beyond my wildest dreams
[Eddie]
Say you'll never leave
Girl when you look at me
I get this feeling inside of me

[Chorus]

[Hook]
You send me chills [x7]
I can't help it
I can't stop it
I can't shake it
[Valure]
I can't lie
Cuz you send me chills
