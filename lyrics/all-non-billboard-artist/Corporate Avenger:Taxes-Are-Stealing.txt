Taxes-Are-Stealing:Corporate Avenger
Listen you fuckers you screw heads here's a man that would not take it anymore a man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit here is some one who stood up. 

Taxes are strong-armed robbery the collectors of taxes funnel the majority of funds to police and intuitions counter productive to spiritual advancement. 

Well taxes are stealing and I get the feeling that were gettin fucked in the ass 
They take what they want to whenever they want to 
And our needs they always come last. 

They lie, they cheat, they steal from you and me. 
They lie, they cheat, they steal from you and me. 

Their heads are in our pockets, they're bleeding us to death 
They fuckin keep on takin till there's nothing fuckin left. 

It's a federal invention, they set the goddamned rate 
It's a little paper portrait with a legacy of hate. 
They're numbing all our senses with their bullshit and their lies. 
It's no goddamned secret it's done right before our eyes. 
And if you don't cooperate they'll lock your ass away 
With the very fucking money that they fucking took away. 

Well taxes are stealing and I get the feeling that were gettin fucked in the ass 
They take what they want to whenever they want to 
And our needs they always come last.

The IRS was not there the other day when I was unloading truck after truck into that hot fucking warehouse 
The IRS was not there the other day when I was pulling weeds in the fucking hot sun 
The IRS was not there when I needed money to pay my bills, but they sure as fuck were there on Friday to take almost half my pay again and again and again and again! 

Your constitution, the laws that they've made say that they can tax your income so they do it every day. 
The IRS policemen they take and take and take, we've got free Masonic symbols in a free Masonic state. 
Lest you forget about your cozy little home, the very place were you live in but you never fuckin own 
It's the craft of the creator, we act out their design 
A society of secrets with the television mind. 

Well taxes are stealing and I get the feeling that were gettin fucked in the ass 
They take what they want to whenever they want to 
And our needs they always come last.
