Stop-The-Train-Remastered-:Bob Marley
Stop the train I'm leaving
Stop the train I'm leaving
Stop the train I'm leaving
it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
all my good life I've been a lonely man
teaching people who don't overstan'
and even though I've tried my bes'
I still dont find no happiness
Stop the train I'm leaving
Stop the train I'm leaving
Stop the train I'm leaving
it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
some goin' east
some goin' west
some step aside
to try their best
some livin' big
but the most livin' small they just cant even find
no food at all
Stop the train I'm leaving
Stop the train I'm leaving
Stop the train I'm leaving
it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Stop the train I'm leaving...
