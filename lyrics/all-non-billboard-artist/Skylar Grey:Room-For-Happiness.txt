Room-For-Happiness:Skylar Grey
Sometimes I wish I never felt the influence of you
Cause now I feel the disconnect, like an open wound
Where you once were, there is a space that runs as deep as hell
But every morning when I wake I tell myself
Dont be fooled by your emptiness,
Theres so much more room for happiness
Dont be fooled by your emptiness,
Theres so much more room for happiness
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes its worth to have lost than to have never had at all
Cause its a curse to feel loved then to feel it all dissolved
Where you once were, there is a space that runs as deep as hell
But every morning when I wake I tell myself
Dont be fooled by your emptiness,
Theres so much more room for happiness
Dont be fooled by your emptiness,
Theres so much more room for happiness
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Dont be fooled by your emptiness,
Theres so much more room for happiness
Dont be fooled by your emptiness,
Theres so much more room for happiness
Yeah, yeah, yeah
