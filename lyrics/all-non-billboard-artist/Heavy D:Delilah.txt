Yo, check this out man, Delilah

How yuh a go boogie when yuh can't even find yuh groove?
But yuh still mek moves, a mi seh, oh Delilah

She's a teenager, but with the pressures of the world
On her shoulders she's much older
Sweet sixteen already a baby's mother, baby father on the move
A mi seh, oh Delilah, check it

How yuh a go dance and yuh can't even buy new shoes?
How yuh a go boogie when yuh can't even find yuh groove?
But yuh still mek moves, a mi seh, oh Delilah

She's always struggling and trying to do better
But it seems like this life just won't let her
So she still mek moves, and she still haffi dance
And boogie without her shoes

Delilah oh, Delilah, pretty baby
How yuh feel when yuh walk dung a empty road?
Pretty girl and, how yuh feel when yuh just can't bare yuh load?
Yuh haffi cry on yuh own, a mi seh, oh Delilah

A mi seh, oh Delilah, Delilah
How yuh a go dance and yuh can't even buy new shoes?
How yuh a go boogie when yuh can't even find yuh groove?
But yuh still mek moves, a mi seh, oh Delilah

A mi seh, ooh, hey, haffi dance and get up
People haffi dance and get up
People yuh haffi move and get up
People yuh haffi dance and get up
People yuh haffi move and get up
People yuh haffi dance and get up

A mi seh, oh Delilah
A mi seh, ooh, hey, haffi dance and get up
People haffi dance and get up
People yuh haffi move and get up

People yuh haffi dance and get up
People yuh haffi move and get up
