Bandit-Queen:Looptroop
Ey yo, bust it, when the police come, yo, she ready for whatever
Never talk to the cops 'cus she got her mind together
A down to earth mother earth living at the speed of life
She don't need a ring to be my wife
A truly independent woman, not a destiny's child
Not depending on money or fashion to have style
She got nuff style - rough style - diamond in the rough
Not a dimepiece in the back, she a diamond in the front
Seat by my side, ready to ride
With a smile on her face when she let me inside
What is this? I need a gangsta bitch, I need love
I need a ride or die bitch? None of the above
I need a terrorist chick taking care of this dick
Ain't nothing superficial like marriage and shit
A truly holy matrimony, she my homie
I forget about this evil world when she hold me

She love love like I do
She need sex like I do
She love freedom like I do
She need music like I do

And yo, I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
A real woman that can bring out the man in me
I said a bandit queen (what, a bandit queen)
Independent enough so she can handle me
Ey yo, a bandit queen (yes, a bandit queen)
She the mother of humanity
I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
She look good, but she not into vanity

I need a riot girl, not a violent girl
But one that knows how to defend herself when they try to quiet her
In this manmade era of gangrapes and terror
Where most men can't face the mirror
She overcome 'cus she positive
She live in love and she love to live
She love to give and love to take
She don't compete 'cus she above the fake
She don't deal with no silly silicone
Even when I'm not with her I don't really feel alone
'Cus there's a metaphysical bond between us
Strong as my penis want the venus
I need the butts and no maybes
I see some ladies tonight that should be having my babies
You know what I mean?
Wanna roll with my team well you know what I need

I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
Independent enough so she can handle me
I said a bandit queen (what, a bandit queen)
A real woman that can bring out the man in me
Ey yo, a bandit queen
She look good, but she not into vanity
I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
She the mother of humanity

I need a bandit queen but man it seems
That the whole world is living in some candy dream
They want a plastic screen - not flesh and blood
They want some bad machine - not blessed love
They're stressed enough for ulcers and bloodclouts
Grey hairs and great fears of what nots
I feel alone in this cold world
But out of 5 billion people there should be a soulgirl
My soulmate, not afraid to hold weight
Baby your soulfood, I love it homemade
The way you stir it up I ain't coming home late
Your recipe is so tasty - give me the whole plate
(Come on) Give me the whole plate
(Come on)

She love love like I do (Blessed love)
She need sex like I do (Aha)
She love freedom like I do (Freedom)
She need music like I do (Come on)

I need a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
Independent enough so she can handle me
I said a bandit queen (a bandit queen)
A real woman that can bring out the man in me
I need a bandit queen
Hey, she ain't living in no fantasy
I need a bandit queen (yo, a bandit queen)
Yes, pullin' me in like bravendy
I need a bandit queen
