Salute-Sacrifice:AchoZen
[The Reverend William Burk]
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in the briefcase, jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait, Reverend William Burk's mind in a deep space
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in the briefcase, jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait, Reverend William Burk's mind in a deep space
We creates at a G's pace, for heaves sake
And for goodness grace, we burn fakes at the stakes
Throw your hands in the sky, and wave 'em side to side
Drunk funk and skunk for getting crunk to ride
Let me hear you holla homicide
She was murdered on the dance floor, more cash in the register drawer
My whole crew pay our rep in the score
We go to war for the pure for sure
To add even more law to the thought of a cure
A hula hoop was 360 degrees, shiny afro blow in the breeze
Used to scoop shabobaloop in the coupe from the green
Queen, I'm James, all through to gold women in tans
I get it down for the CREAM, I help achieve they dream

Check this shit out...
22 frames a second, paradox shift shocks
Sword swings, swift slice, serious sounds
Spectacular shine, cypher supreme, sucker divine
The curious mind, the furious who rhyme
Sustain the streets low, sacrifice slip storyline
Sicks got sight eye
Stimulate strike sonic and sudden, sophisticated souls stay stainless
Salute, spit swat, spine, subtle severe
Snow blind, subliminal signs
Speculate six superficial stereotypes, stereotypical skeptics
Epics, except swine
Skeptics, seen in septics, sick spiritual swill spend all
Spank, curious, sick, sonic, sick, super, sick, stereo, sick
Syndrome, stay stainless, sip Scotch, sophisticated
Sick sacrifice syndrome, stay stainless, sip Scotch, sophisticated
Sick sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

Krispy Kremes in the suitcase, laser beams in the briefcase, onion
Rings for the cheapskates
Diamond rings on the finger of my baby cakes
Achozen few we only plays for the high stakes
Series of silver, swindling service decipher the suttle signals
The spinner, spindling yard on the school
A student who took who for school in a Cee Allah Rule
Dropping a jewel on this educated fool
Simulated sonar signals, space symbol, severe civil rivalries
Split brothers and sisters
Twisters and blizzards, blow the gizzards out of lizards
We sizzle wizards, ninjas, gold dentures, trenches

Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

[Beretta 9]
Supposed stay in school and show and study
Supplements is needed, student instead of a slack skip sleet
Slapped him in the scalp and seen ya
Soon to the sent, to vibe the streets
Man I was stupid, straight up sick, decided supreme
Story, just a real to scene
A soldier stay strapped with a sub machine
Soon to shot, subtracted, stretched out
On the sidewalk, had to be scraped with a spatula
The shit stuck to the ceiling, my skills so sick
So I must say, to what if you second, sucker

Okay, kay, kay
Kill cutlery knives, kill conniving kids in it
Kid crazy cookies to corrupt you kiddy kittens
Kicking off committing criminal capers, cutting Klansmen
Kid, I build Kurtis cube kite to Kansas
Cranium like axles in kings they cause brain cells
To snap crackle and pop, like Kellogg's Krispies
Colliding kaleidoscopes for visual collisions
Captain Caveman, want Colonel chicken
Cookies in a rock, Obama like Barack
OK-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R, Z-A, stop
Super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
Soak sweet Sandra's sheets til they sexy and steaming
Still slick majestic, bless who says in they essence
Snatch the woman's socks while Metropolis stresses
Sip superior stigmas, and slang Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum, left the brain stained
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacra-sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacra, sacra, sacra
I said, super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
I soak sweet Sandra's sheets til she steaming
Still slick majestic, bless who says in they essence
Snatch the woman's socks while Metropolis stresses
Sip superior stigmas, and slang Staten Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum, leaves the brain stained
Sacrifice, sacrifice
