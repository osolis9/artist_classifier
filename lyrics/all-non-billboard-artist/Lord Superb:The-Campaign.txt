The-Campaign:Lord Superb
[Lord Superb]
See Listen, I'm the Pope of the rock, I ain't talking religion
Got the city on lock, I ain't talking about prison
Got the pot, Stove, Coke in the kitchen
We sell it while we cook it, You can smoke in the kitchen
Just had a son, Baby need new shoes
I'm getting ready for the summer, Baby blue coupe
I'm off parole, Back on my shit
It's like I'm laying on the ground, The streets is back on my dick
Haters is still hate'n so that fifth's on my hip
Got in touch with the connect, I'm back on my trips
One car in front, One behind
Cause I need like five pussies and one behind, That's it

[Interlude: Lord Superb]
The President's back, Yall can vote for me
Yall can vote for he, He is, The candidate to vote for
The President of Farrock America is back
Listen, Listen, Listen, Uhh, Uhh
Farrock America, Lets go, Lets go

I'mma step out clean in this shit, Dress mean in this shit
Thug life, I'm the zenith to it
I'm Joe Clark in a Farnsworth, I'm leaning in a bent
You like that color, What's that green, No it's mint
I just signed for a mil, They think I'm dealing now
The Jacob look like diamonds on the sofa in the Steelersâ€™ Lounge
They wanna say Perb's the nigga
When I come through in an Ambulance on chrome
That's how I'm hurting niggas, I'm back, By un-popular demand
The hood is calling, It's my number one fan
Your boy is here, My voice is clear
Plus I got a nice hook, High hat and snare
Rebirth of the street poets, Urban author
New generation swagger with faces of our Fathers
We all targets, They want us extinct
Did my first state bid at the age of sixteen
Now they got paper on me, But I got paper homie
Give some to a lawyer, Tell him take them cases off me
My S Block niggas keeping it funky
When you hear this shit, Beat up your bunky
Your men ain't changed, I'm still G'd up and hungry
Tryna be knee deep up in money, Feet up and comfy

[Interlude: Lord Superb]
The President's back, Yall can vote for me
I'm the canidate to vote for, No hook, No nothing
This is just campaigning, For real, Farrock America
The ad-libs will be crazy, I'm telling yall niggas man

[Lord Superb]
Listen, I just don't talk about heaters and crack
I'm an emcee, What type of emcee'n is that
Let's talk about the flow for a minute
To gangstas and thugs, We'll be back to the dough in a minute
The word play's serious, Flow's Niagara
The whole hood know I'm hard and I don't fuck with Viagra
A couple years back I had the heat spraying
Pause for a sec, Let's hear what the street's saying
The street say he the best and he real
Plus his flow's like water, It go great with an ecstasy pill
