Advance-to-Boardwalk-album-version-:Cella Dwellas
[Hook:]
A-yo, get nice, shoot dice
Skip the small talk son,
Advance to Boardwalk
Collect the properties and profits
Expand and make doe, yo
Slip past go

[Phantasm:]
Check the drama, as the saga starts to unfold,
To advance and pass go, get the pot of gold
In the Meditteranean, I met this fly lady and
She had two brothers, the rich Parker Brothers
On the run from the IRS, for income tax
After this heist son we sittin' on stacks
In this new community, looking for the treasure chest
I took a wrong left turn, fuck it yo, never the less
It's my fault kid, we ended up on Baltic
Off course, but still we ain't takin' a loss
There he go, Reading at the Railroad in his porshe
Waitin' for his brother to come in on the iron horse

[UG:]
Can it be so simple, playin' in my rental
On Oriental, avenue
Passing through Conneticut, got to get to Vermont
Just to visit Matt Life, in the clink
I'm back for stolen minks and snatchin' link

[Phantasm:]
After Charles Place, let me check Digga and Masta Ace
And the I.N.C., they own the Electric Company
Next, is the State of Virginia, where I'm a don
And got Mad Skillz like Shaquan
At the train station, we waitin' for my Pennsylvannia connect
To come through and show us love and respect
Don't even take aim, cause he's a Saint like James
And when you done with body (burn him into flames)

[UG:]
Sippin' Hennessy, on Tennesse, with Hav and P
See Schott Free, asked me to walk to New York Ave
Bag two chicks who went first after Free Parkin'
We see Lou Diamounds and Tony Stars and
Some kid tried to buck me off Kentucky
Some gang named Chance for bandanas
So I ran to Indiana
Illinois and his boys, held me down, they got my back
Pass the gat, yes, I'm just cool like dat

[Hook]

[Phantasm:]
It's after 3 yo, we at B&O; amtrack and Marvin Garden
A player like Phantasm is starvin'
Check the fountain and see if the Water Works
As I send four messengers to Ventor

[UG:]
I was on Atlantic with my man
Quick to snatch jewels and hit the scale see
See 50 didn't want to hit the jail
On Pennsylvannia, I met Loranna, she had on Guess
She said "You need a vest goin' through Community Chest"
Or NC, North Carolina if you visit
You look exquisit, trail gooks made by Pacific
Kick the short line, shortie was mine, she was with it
I got the digits, but never got the chance to hit it

[Phantasm:]
At Park Place, the the Parker Brothers safe
And made a killin', I skated with about 2 million
But we got to pay tax on a luxury
The Cella Dwellas plan is to expand and live comfortably
