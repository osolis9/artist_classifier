The-Winner-Loses:Body Count
My friend's addicted to cocaine
Smokes day and night drives mom and pop insane
Living his life in the dark light
Every dollar he gets goes into the pipe

He wants to borrow some money from me
Do you think I'm blind
Don't know the score
Can't see?

You wanna get high as the sky
(You're kissin' your life goodbye)
You're kissin' your life goodbye
(You think it's a game)
You think it's a game that you play
(But the winners lose)
But the winners lose it all someday

Ya don't know who you are you losin' your mind?
Things get a little tight he committed a crime
Give me your money or give me your life
You better empty your pockets because ya
You don't live twice

You wanna get high as the sky
(You're kissin' your life goodbye)
You're kissin' your life goodbye
(You think it's a game)
You think it's a game that you play
(But the winners lose)
But the winners lose it all someday

He took the money to the dope man
And he said he had the best
Next thing ya knew, cardiac arrest
It was a roller coaster, he couldn't get off
Next thing I knew my friends' life was lost, no

You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game

You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game

You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game

You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game
You think it's a game, you think it's a game

You wanna get high as the sky
(You're kissin' your life goodbye)
You're kissin' your life goodbye
(You think it's a game)
You think it's a game that you play
(But the winners lose)
But the winners lose it all someday

You wanna get high as the sky
(You're kissin' your life goodbye)
You're kissin' your life goodbye
(You think it's a game)
You think it's a game that you play
(But the winners lose)
But the winners lose it all someday

You wanna get high as the sky
(You're kissin' your life goodbye)
You're kissin' your life goodbye
(You think it's a game)
You think it's a game that you play
(But the winners lose)
But the winners lose it all someday

You wanna get high as the sky
