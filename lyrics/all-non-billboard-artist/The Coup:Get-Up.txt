Get-Up:The Coup
Dead Prez, The Coup
People Army, where the G's at?
C'mon, fuck the police
Ay, y'all ready for this shit for y'all trunk?
Y'all ready to get this bitch crunk?

You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're 'sposed to be fed up right now
Turn the system upside down
Get up

Honestly, I'm against this government
I ain't gotta cover it up, that's what I meant
Sick of payin' bills and I'm sick of payin' rent
Seem like I work all the time, but, don't know where the money went

And the funny shit is we supposed to like this shit
But all y'all politicians can bite this dick
It's a war goin' on, the ghetto is a cage
They only give you two choices be a rebel or a slave

(So what you do?)
So, I rebel like a ulcer in the belly of the beast
Stayin' true to it, since my home street days in the blue Buick
Niggas been fightin' so long seem like I'm used to it

Now, what y'all know 'bout how The Coup do it?
Truth fluid, boots put the funk to it, ain't nothin' to it
This is for the G's all the way to the bay
For 'Frisco to Oakland all over L.A., ya gotta get up

You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're 'sposed to be fed up right now
Turn the system upside down
Get up

Now uhh, this fella, spits yella, never been a snitch teller
One pace up from my homies ditch dweller
Yellin', "Fuck 'em Rocafella", my shit bump in acapella
My lyrical quotes are nervous notes to bank tellers

When we call it off, we haulin' off, Molotov's and bricks
Mr. Bailiff you could put that in the transcripts
Hope your motherfucking petty workin' band flips
Some saw it off, I prefer hand-grips

Quote us, you know we're stronger than a 3 day no tice
Pay a quit, it's more of us than lies your mayor spit
I'm on some, "Ma hate the game but love the player", shit
Is you a, "Have" or you a, "Have not"?

When you run out of bullets grab rocks
'Cuz the prison don't slam locks
It don't open when your fam knocks
'Less you rich and have stocks

Fight the power like a motherfucking Zulu
It's The Coup plus Kanume and Mutulu
So, raise your hands in the air like your born again
But make a fist for the struggle we was born to win

You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're 'sposed to be fed up right now
Turn the system upside down
Get up

When I hear the woop-woop, I be duckin' them hoes
I can smell a pig comin', so, I stay on my toes
On the low from po-po, so fuck the ho lice
'Cuz peace to me is loaded under my seat

And I know power respect that so, 'Serve and Protect', that
I'm young, black, and just don't give a fuck try me
Grillin' you right back, you better drive by me
We the People Army is known to get rowdy

And even if you a friend of the blue
You can get it too, snitchin' is never forgettable
This hell we livin' is never forgivable
It come down to DP and The Coup

Remember Huey, Bobby Hutton, George, Fred and them
Fuck the po-po, local, state, fed and them
You better choose your side, Crip Blood 415
It's one team, get up and let's ride

You got to get up right now
Turn the system upside down
You're 'sposed to be fed up right now
Turn the system upside down
Get up
