Gangsta-Omeguh-Remix-:Kat Dahlia
You say you a gangsta, that don't impress me none
You say you a gangsta, ain't seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I ain't getting help
From no one, from no one

Yeah I'm young, 21, living in a crazy world
But I know the difference between a man and a herb
You frontin' like you got it, claim they hating on your wallet
Gucci telling you the time and you watch it,
Nah I ain't stunting like my daddy, he's living with my grammy
Used to be a big baller, he surviving off of gambling
But I love him, he's my daddy, yeah I love him hes' my daddy
Put him in a big house, before I ever see a grammy
And my mommy started working days at the church
Finding Faith in God cause the real world hurts
So much evil lurks, they just make us work
But we cant find work
Abuela, mami, and the girls, in a one bedroom
South beach lifestyle, they just paying for the view
Mommy on the couch, since she was 42
Sacrificing for the kids, cause thats what mommies do
So I smoke my spliff, I spliff it hard
Candy says to stop my voice is getting too harsh
So I sobered up, and my thoughts they rush
And now I think of you, behind bars
Cross state lines, they spliffin' good
In Miami you catch a charge
And the whole family tears apart

You say you a gangsta, that dont impress me none
You say you a gangsta, aint seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I aint getting help
From no one, from no one

And this recession so depressing
My parents dont stop stressing
Just hoping I learned all they lessons
And Im paying for this session
Im paying for this session
And Im paying rent, food, clothes, phone, christmas presents
6 shots in, Im just counting all my blessings
No days off baby I aint resting
I told my sins, now Im done confessing

x 2
You say you a gangsta, but that dont impress me none
You say you a gangsta, aint seen a thing you done
I do it all on myself, I aint getting help
From no one, from no one

Come way to the top, I make with what Ive got
You want my number baby, Im on a mission, catch up
Men sellin love like thieves
But when the girlie leaves, he'll start flirting with me
So I took my heart off my sleeve
Never trust a man cause they all hungry
Yeah they all hungry
Never trust a man cause they all hungry

x 2
Right when you thought you had me
Baby you just lost someone
Finally got over you
Baby time to move on
Never learned your lesson, aint even gone question
Why it went so wrong?

You say you a gangsta, that dont impress me none
You say you a gangsta, aint seen a thing you done
