Raw:Saul Williams
What's a song if you can't fuck to it?
I want to move deep in the gut of it.
But what's the right kind of behaviour
To qualify as someone's saviour?

What kind of question is that anyway?
I know I don't deserve your time of day.
But since you're giving me some time tonight
Then hold me close girl and just squeeze me tight.
Raw.

I want to touch you on the other side
Where all your anger, fear, and hurt reside
I want to get to know the part of you
That I can crawl inside, the heart of you.
Raw.

Oooh.
