It's da juice from the north side of town
With a frown I'm bout to get a gun and start to clown
On a fool on any fool who break the rules
Imma do whatever young nigga have to do
To get respect to do what's next like malcolm x
Never slipping I'm staring out the window with a tech
Bring it on up to the door I'll never go
But I'm blasting until I see you lyin on the floor,
This is real too real them niggas feel what I feel
Them evergreen niggas bout to kill anybody
Say they name where they live show some pictures
Especially if it's mom or some kids
Run up on ya and put em on ya like pneumonia
You'll be sick I scared ya ya probably go in to a coma
I ain't playing and I ain't laughing cause I'm passive
Just looking blasting just like I'm on the lose I'm crazy assassin (nigga)

Its kinda hard lets catch a spy hunting in a four cylinder
Pealing a drilling a hole in your jugular
Wheeling a .40 -a pissing in your skully-a
Tearing a barrier black haven area


But I'm slow and tear da club up thugs if you down
To beat some motherf**kers soft
Bullets f**king pepperoni it's phony
Step in my face make a nigga catch a case of death
F**king with me nigga hoe I got milk
And watch it splash on your goddamn chest
Cause when you're f**king with thugs niggas you f**king with the best
F**k the rest got you chilling with a real nigga from the haze
There is only henn and red dog and purple haze
That's the phase grandma think I'm craze
F**king drugs killa carved on your arm got a tech up in the car
For your motherf**kin ass see you wet the b-e-d
But you better hold right up cause I'm gonna make your ass bleed bitch

I hate a weak ass nigga like a devil hate life
Cock that k full of rage cause the bullshit you started
Put your vest on bitch and watch me aim for your head
Like whodini abracadabra motherf**ker you dead
As I tippy toe behind you like that doll named chucky
Sludge hammer you will feel it if you living you lucky
Ten stories you will fall to the motherf**kin floor
I don't know you tuck your nuts and die hoe (better kill me)

{spice 1}
Well to wet em means cash *blow blow* how you like me now
I'm be murdering all of my enemy savage hatin up the town
Saved for bed night stalking creeping put em all to sleep
And leave em leaking bleeding seeking and steadily heating
And I'll be speeding off tearing up da club not giving a f**k
It's just me and tear da club up thugs kept on they nuts
Killing em wet em up say wet em up say wet em up blow *blow blow*
They come with the mob tactics and hear us pow *ba pow*
Definitely about to buck it f**k it I'm dumping them in ditches
And killing snitches and shiesty bitches who set em up for riches
Spray these f**king cockroaches with these two pistols out
You niggas checked into the game but you wont check out
Beam the motherf**kin lights and I smash the gas
Clutch my bitch nina ross tight and murder they ass
Which one of you niggas is first to feel the blast
Ain't coming for money I want your life f**k the cash
