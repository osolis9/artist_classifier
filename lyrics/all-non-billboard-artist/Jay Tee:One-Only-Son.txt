One-Only-Son:Jay Tee
I can stay without you
but the only thing is that I
wouldnt have the power when i had with you
I can stand everything
even when the world is gonna breakdown
but this is only possible when im with you
Just stay with me
I need your love
Its like im losing my soul and heart
Im like a king without a queen and crown
Could you please
Dont leave
Youre like the colour of my gray life
Im hoping you would finish my outline
Cause I know youre the only one.
