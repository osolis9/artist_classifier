The-Bio:Chip Tha Ripper
Niggas dont know shit about me first house on Woodworth and EC
One-Nine-Eight-Six the year it be my middle name is Swahili
Cause daddy was on that Black Panther shit Like the medallion African
Momma taught school and dad did too lived in the hood where the kids bad news
So momma used my auntie's address so they would never have me possessed
What ever she did to relieve her stress Hid it from me pretty good I guess
First rap I heard ever Six years old Will Smith Fresh Prince that shit was so cold
Hypnotized by them rhymes every smart kid understands those lines
Front porch on Thornhill kicking up raps All my niggas now been my niggas way back
Ten years old blowing niggas wigs back Like 'damn little man who taught you that?'
Yeah I was baby man Rode my back on any land
Then my little sister came and mom and pop spilt up again
For the umpteenth shits gonna be fine momma said headphones on bumping them rhymes
Im Eleven years old with the mind of a G Ain't no anybody who think like me
With little arms I build and eat miss my nigga Mondo rest in peace
Moved down South fifth grade mega county really made me a man
On my own small little town big shit went on
Shot my first gun in the woods Ninth grade moved right back to the hood
Saint Claire I thought I was going to be a superstar athlete
Then asthma attacked me put that shit on that backseat
And got back on that rhymin and bought some studio time
With them ends I saved up cutting grass and just a little grindin'
Ain't nobody know about daddy taught me patience keep that money in the bank
He said when I got cake from Atlantic Records I was Eighteen
No lawyer on the scene when I signed that wet dream
Got some paper dough racks (racks) commas (commas) dollars (dollars)
I thought I was set for life cause I ain't had no knowledge 'bout life (naw)
Niggas ain't cuttin' them slacks when it comes to them years niggas losin' their lives (lives)
I learned to stay off of the scene cause theres nothing but bullets and trouble at night (night)
And my nigga Hart can no longer walk around Id rather take his advice (advice)
If you get a chance to do something real do it right cause you cannot do it twice (nigga)
A mission to get 'em to switch it a little bit different and tell 'em theres more ways to make a living my nigga
States was Nineteen when they gave 'em Thirty Eight years in that prison
I sent him some pics so he see how we livin'
And these were the cards I was given:
