Music-Man:Shaun Boothe
[**feat. Amanda DiVa**]



[Intro:]
 Music-
 Music-
 Music Man

 Oh didn't they tell you, not to fall for a music man

[Shaun Boothe:]
 Uh, Look...
 I'm lovin her, I'm lovin her,
 But I gotta juggle her,
 Cause I'm doin other stuff-
 She doesn't approve
 She want me to choose,
 Talkin to me rude
 I'm not in the mood,
 Uh-
 And ye know things are bad,
 When every time the phone rings she mad,
 It's like Pavla [?]
 She say when I come home drunk,
 I rub er' the wrong way
 And do dumb shit like roll on the rubber the wrong way, (wrong way, wrong way)
 Yeah,
 N still every time I do a show
 She never want me to go
 I tell her ya beautiful
 But I'm tryna see tha globe
 She be like-
 Don't gimme that shit it's only Peterbrough - Heh
 And nuttin nah she actin foolish,
 She don't wanna hear it,
 She want me to prove it,
 Sayin if you only cared about me like your music,
 Look call me when you come up with some new shit.

[Chorus:]
 Oh didn't they tell you, (uh huh) Not to fall for a music man, (Not to fall, Not to fall) Oh didn't they tell you, Not to fall for a music -

[Amanda Diva:]
 Ahhh
 (Dooo, do do d-d-doo d-doo)
 Star crossed, from the start - I shoulda seen it comin'- (uh huh)
 Had the game, in my heart - turnin' summersaults that summer and I -
 Always knew, that I could neva ever shine as bright-
 As his limelight
 Cause once them hits start spinnin'
 And the hype starts gettin real-
 He forgets you cause you're nothin
 To how the fan field makes him feel-
 And though you try to let go,
 He still haunts you fa sho,
 Cause outta sight outta mind,
 It don't exist-
 When everybody's got his ringtone

 Oh didn't they tell you, (They told me) Not to fall for a music man, (Not to fall, Not to fall)
 Oh didn't they tell you, Not to fall for music man

[Shaun Boothe:]
 Oh yea, (oh yea)
 My turn, (my turn)
 I got it, (I got it)

 She want me to comfort her,
 Under her comforter,
 But I got gigs man-
 Big plans can I do my thing -damn-
 No she want phone time, she want alone time,
 I can't read- she like "do that on your own time"
 Everyday it's always me-me-me-me-me
 Like a singer tryna find a key,
 Threatin to leave, oh-
 Oh I see what this is she want me to choose between my hits and my misses,
 Well I don't play that,
 I ain't havin that,
 She say I'm self absorbed-
 I say I'm passionate,
 Yeah-
 I'm handlin B.I so I hit it n' run like a beehive
 Soon as I'm done she right back to playin P.I,
 Thinkin I'm chasin these groupies,
 Told her you go IT backwards like T.I,
 They be chasin me, N they might grab up a nigga,
 But you my main squeeze, why you gotta make a scene... (why you gotta make a scene)

 Oh didn't they tell you, Not to fall for a music man, (uh huh) Oh didn't they tell you
 Hold on Hold on Hold on Hold on,
 We gonna ride this one out with the keys one time (one time)
 (Dooo, do do d-d-doo d-doo)
 Yeah (yeah)
 Whoo (whoo)
