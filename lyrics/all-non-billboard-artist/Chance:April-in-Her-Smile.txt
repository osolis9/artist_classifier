April-in-Her-Smile:Chance
Hate to break it down to you like this
But I gotta get this off my chest
First let me say I love you
And I put no one above you girl
But I'm getting tired and I'm saying we don't belong
But it's becaue they thinking we too young

From your mum and your pops
From my friends on my block
I wanna run away you know that I would
I give you all I got, you return every drop
One of these days we gunna fly away

Gunna say bye bye to the world
Just for my girl, to be with my girl
Gunna say bye bye to my fam
Gunna say bye bye to my friends
I can't let this be the end (let this be the end)
Gunna say bye bye to the world
Just for my girl, to be with my girl
Gunna say bye bye to my home
We'll be back when were grown
Say bye bye to the world just to say hello to my girl

They think we too young for love I know they wrong
Can't let our (?)
Lets escape right now on a star or a cloud
To a place we can walk hand in hand
And we goin to rock it out we too high to drop
Never regret anything I do with you babe
I give you all I got you return every drop
One of these days we gunna fly away

Gunna say bye bye to the world
Just for my girl, to be with my girl
Gunna say bye bye to my fam
Gunna say bye bye to my friends
I can't let this be the end (let this be the end)
Gunna say bye bye to the world
Just for my girl, to be with my girl
Gunna say bye bye to my home
We'll be back when were grown
Say bye bye to the world just to say hello to my girl

Felt so far in love no one can pick us up
Wish they would leave us alone so we could stay forever
Our love in so strong it makes us rebel yes
Baby let me up so we can be together
Do you believe in love
And when they see us it will be magical
But until then

Gunna say bye bye to the world (to the world)
Just for my girl, to be with my girl
Gunna say bye bye to my fam
Gunna say bye bye to my friends
I can't let this be the end (let this be the end)
Gunna say bye bye to the world
Just for my girl, to be with my girl
Gunna say bye bye to my home
We'll be back when were grown
Say bye bye to the world just to say hello to my girl
