Being Nobody



Captured effortlessly,
That's the way it was,
Happened so naturally,
I did not know it was love,
The next thing I felt was you,
Holding me close,
What was I gonna do? I let myself go 

And now we're flyin' through the stars,
I hope this night will last forever 

I've been waitin' for you,
It's been so long,
I knew just what I would do,
When I heard your song,
Filled my heart with your bliss,
You gave me freedom,
You knew I could not resist, I needed someone 

And now we're flyin' through the stars,
I hope this night will last forever, Oh oh oh oh 

Ain't nobody (nobody baby) 
Loves me better (loves me better) 
Makes me happy (so happy) 
Makes me feel this way 
Ain't nobody (nobody yeah yeah) 
Loves me better than you 

I wait for night time to come,
And bring you to me,
Can't believe I'm the one,
I was so lonely.
I feel like no one could feel,
I must be dreamin',
I want this dream to be real, I need this feelin' 

I make my wish upon a star,
And hope this night will last forever 

Ain't nobody (nobody baby) 
Loves me better (loves me better) 
Makes me happy (so happy) 
Makes me feel this way 
Ain't nobody (nobody yeah yeah) 
Loves me better than you 

At first you put your arms around me (First you put you arms around me) Then 
you put your charms around me (Then you put your charms around me)
I can't resist this sweet surrender (I cant resist this sweet surrender)
Oh my nights are warm and tender (oh my nights so warm and tender) 
We stare into each other's eyes (We stare into each others eyes) 
And what we see is no surprise (and what we see is no surprise) 
Got a feeling most will treasure (Got a feeling most will treasure) 
And a love so deep we cannot measure 

Ain't nobody (nobody baby) 
Loves me better (loves me better) 
Makes me happy (so happy) 
Makes me feel this way 
Ain't nobody (nobody yeah yeah) 
Loves me better than you 

Ain't nobody (nobody baby) 
Loves me better (loves me better) 
Makes me happy (so happy) 
Makes me feel this way 
Ain't nobody (nobody yeah yeah) 
Loves me better than you
