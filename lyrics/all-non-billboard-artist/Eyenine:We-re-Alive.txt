We-re-Alive:Eyenine
I used to think that people had a lot to offer
But now it seems like there's no use in believing
There was a time when you could feel the warmth of others
But times have changed and nearly everyone is freezing
I've had a lot of time to think about how things are
And I don't really see this ending very pleasantly
This time my eyes are pointed at the lit stars
Whatever happens, I can't ever let it get to me

My bed just isn't what it used to be
Once a safe haven, not just a place I choose to dream
This blanket can't hide me from my problems
The answer's right outside but it still remains so new to me
I try to help this by expressing myself musically
The more I write the more I lose sight of the muse I keep
I could try out different styles of creating
But every single one just brings me right back into losing sleep
I understand that my life won't play out beautifully
I need a hand but my pride won't let me through to reach
The little moments adding up to such an end
That I never truly noticed that these phases change so fluently
It's getting harder to impress this changing music scene
So many artists cannot ever reach congruency
I'll keep creating like it's all that I have left
And in the end I think that's really all that I can do for me

I used to think that people had a lot to offer
But now it seems like there is so much more to take
I never thought this life could still be such a bother
But there is love out there that's mixed in with the hate
These are lessons that I've learned from growing older
Nothing ceases in this endless flow of time
We'll meet again when the weather gets colder
Truly yours, eyenine

This is it, this is now, this is why
We're a hit, we're a joke, we're alive
We can cry, we can run, we can hide
We can go on with our lives or we can wait around to die
This is it, this is now, this is clear
How we run, how we fight, how we fear
All the troubles we've avoiding getting near
We can put an end to all right here

Connections, nothing matters in the face of this
Statement of complacence that we take for granted with a kiss
If we manage the damage that happens in our heart, then
Maybe we could change the reason that we grew so far apart
Days turn to the months, turn to years, turn to never
I've been with fed up with this ever incarcerating endeavor
It's hard to take in forever when your life is not indefinite
The message that we send to our descendants is irrelevant
Picture perfect, it's worth it to spend a little time
Thinking why we even try to head across the finish line
I'll second guess the lesson forever if it can make a change
Death can only save us the effort to never stay the same
Lights left on, nobody's home
A life left early, lost love left alone
Time heals all so I'm over it now
With these drowned out sounds, I'm alone in a crowd
