Rottweilers-Audible-Doctor-Remix-:Brown Bag AllStars
Left them redder then venison.
Obsessive, Compulsive--
Stressed and repulsive
Veneering menance, whim off of my medicine
Life is chess game; they learning that they reps fake
They denying it time and time, they best wait so checkmate
They know from the start
They flooded in like Noah's ark
These rappers all fell off years ago with like Cohen art
With open heart to save them. before the undertaker had to take em'
And the angels waited over with the boats
Just to embrace em' and enslave em'
They staying contemplating while we carefully calculate each move
Before we make em
Like docs said we just dont like you and your mans and them
My claws of adamantium. Believe me theres no chance for them
Roll up bumping onxy in that that caddy that im lamping in
You know the wraith is, massive ass
Kim dash's, Big asses
Hit bastards, lit matches
Slip gases, Back draft have em doing 6 backflips

Soul khan:
Ayo we Rottweilers
