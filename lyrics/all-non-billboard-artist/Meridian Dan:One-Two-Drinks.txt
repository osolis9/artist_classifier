One-Two-Drinks:Meridian Dan
I come through on a sick hype
Come through, black Yamaha R6 bike
Can't come around and take this mic
I've got a sick vibe
When I come through dripping in swag, all rich like
Black on black on black like midnight
I did wrong but less than I did right
R6 man, big man ride big bike
I don't wanna see man acting fly
I see through all that stuff with my eye
Man act fly but I don't know why
Not me, I am the actual guy
I'm fly but keep my feet on the ground
I know how much pence in a pound
I just wanna mash up the game and bounce
So I've gotta make sure these hours count

Man had one, two drinks, wanna scuff
One or two drinks makes anyone rough
Why can't you drink one or two drinks
And then say to me "yo fam, bare love"?
Man had one, two drinks, wanna scuff
One or two drinks makes anyone rough
Just drink your one or two drinks
And then say to me "yo Dan, bare love"

I came in the game, no 1, 2, step
I'm a big man in the team that I rep
See a few man wanna do my job
But ain't done no research or prep
I spray grime, don't think that I rap
Out on road, bare tunes on the Mac
All of my songs make people clap
I don't wanna see no dudes with a MAC
All of the hype talk's wack
Why would you talk bare smack?
I came out to a party
If you're a soldier, go to Iraq
Man had one, two drinks, wanna fight
Why would a man wanna mess up my night?
If it's not me, it's the man that I came with
You can't fight him cause me and him's tight

Man had one, two drinks, wanna scuff
One or two drinks makes anyone rough
Why can't you drink one or two drinks
And then say to me "yo fam, bare love"?
Man had one, two drinks, wanna scuff
One or two drinks makes anyone rough
Just drink your one or two drinks
And then say to me "yo Dan, bare love"

Listen to this, get onto your bike
I wanna dance to a tune that I like
Don't wanna be dark, fam that's dead
I'm a man of God, I walk in the light
I wanna drink brandy and Sprite
That MC was tearing mic
This is what my life was made for
Mind my drink, I'm wearing white
I was never gone but I'm back with a bang
I'm out here and I've gotta go H•A•M
This is the life I was made for
Don dadda adi it's Dan, boom bam
I wanna make music, I've gotta make dough
All of the Roll Deep dons I know
Can't tell me anything about Bloodline
Everyone's family, Boy Better Know

Man had one, two drinks, wanna scuff
One or two drinks makes anyone rough
Why can't you drink one or two drinks
And then say to me "yo fam, bare love"?
Man had one, two drinks, wanna scuff
One or two drinks makes anyone rough
Just drink your one or two drinks
And then say to me "yo Dan, bare love"

Man had one, two drinks, wanna scuff
One or two drinks makes anyone rough
