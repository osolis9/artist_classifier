Husband-or-Wife:Nawlage
You know, your just trying to do me
Find me a chick,
It's getting kind of hard to do now days

(Whooa whooa)

I know you know what I'm talkin 'bout ladies
She don't wanna wind, no, cause her man too close by
She don't wanna grind, no, cause her man too close by
She don't wanna wind, no, cause her man too close by
She don't wanna grind, no, cause her man too close by

I seen her outside the club
I tell my niggas that's what's up
I seen her inside the club
Faithfully shakin her butt
I see her dancin with her girlfriend
I didn't see her boyfriend
But when I tried to join in
I was so annoyed when she said

I couldn't give up on this beauty
I had a feeling she was lieing to me
I havn't seen a man close too her tonight
I'm not giving up, I'll get it
She gon give it up, I'll get it
I'm not giving up, nope, not giving up
Not giving up even though still she says

After I put two and two together
I think I fianlly figured it out
She came here with that girl,
Shes dancing with that girl,
I'm assuming she's with that girl,
I can assure you that they're lesbian

Now I know why she made up this excuse

Now a days girls just wanna be bi or lesbian, bi or lesbian
I had a better chance when she used to say
