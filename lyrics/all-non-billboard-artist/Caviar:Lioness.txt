Lioness:Caviar
S.O.S. I'm burned out
I try to transmit from the dead star
Solar flare, then black out
I hope knowing hope won't go too far

I know that the one who strays
Is the one who gets the better half
It's hard to ignore
Now that it's said

You've been knocked off course
Don't fear
Someone will come for you

Lioness, well they only feed
The ugly parts of you
Lioness, well you scarred them all in
Ways you never knew

Resuscitate, open eyes
We start to pick through the wreckage
Seconds late right on time
But can we decipher the message?

I know that the one who strays
Is the one who gets the better half
It's hard to ignore
Now that it's said

You've been blown off course
Sit tight
Someone'll salvage you

Lioness, well they only feed
The ugly parts of you
Lioness, well you scarred them all in
Ways you never knew

Lioness, when the meanness finally
Takes it's toll on you
Lioness, lioness

Lioness, well they only feed
The ugly parts of you
Lioness, well you scarred them all in
Ways you never knew

Lioness, well the very things of
Helping haunting you
Lioness, lioness
