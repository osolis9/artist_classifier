Island-in-the-sun:Kali
This is my island in the sun
Where my people have toiled since time begun
I may sail on many a sea
Her shores will always be home to me

As morning breaks
The heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand

I see woman on bended knee
Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the water-side
Casting nets at the surging tide

I hope the day will never come
That I can't awake to the sound of drum
Never let me miss carnaval
With calypso songs full of soft colors.

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand
