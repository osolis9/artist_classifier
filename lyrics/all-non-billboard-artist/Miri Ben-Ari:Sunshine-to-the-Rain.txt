Sunshine-to-the-Rain:Miri Ben-Ari
I spent my years isolated, couldn't live with myself
I was trouble as a young kid, my tears didn't help
Very depressing and it was evident, I'd fade to the deep
All alone like these four walls came at me

Barricaded 'cuz my mind state, I just wanted to die
Never happiness, just sad time living a lie
Rater leave me, I was suicidal, slittin' my wrist
Mama thinking I was crazy, like use some sense

And on them days I was feeling, I was paining inside
It wasn't me, it was my inner feeling coming alive
I remember waking up like I was going to school
Left me standing in the hospital, locked in this room

Put away, I was a troubled kid losing my mind
Fallin' short of what they expected from me every time
So don't fault me if you meet me and I look to be strange
I'm just mad that the sunshine dies in the rain

Sunshine to the rain, when it comes, it goes again
Even when the story ends, just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days, don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way, your sunshine for cloudy days

Now I was raised in a neighborhood with half of a dime
If you was real it was understood, it showed in your eyes
Every corner had a different hustle, sprawled on your face
Drug wars, growin' up raw 'cuz violence the case, had to move along

Quiet, it's kept, spoken words got you dealt with, so ride with yourself
I'm a juvenile, they telling me get down for they wealth
No getting high 'cuz when you gettin' high, you needing some help
As far as help, mine was middle though, you know how that go?

Psychologically, I deal with demons talkin' in codes
Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jesus, somewhere on this road
Sick of hearing people screaming in my head saying, â€½Noâ€
Better of if I was dead 'cuz they killing me slow

All in all it's just a part of my life, watching the show
Ain't nothing never came to niggaz sleep, except for a dream
It's like a movie with the ending credits etched in the screen

Sunshine to the rain, when it comes, it goes again
Even when the story ends, just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days, don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way, your sunshine for cloudy days

I prayed my last days of sunshine, just die in the rain
Kinda selfish but I know that dying eases the pain
Heartfelt words, spoken hurt, provided the frame
For the pictur,e I done painted for the master to explain

So I leave behind my testimony, witness to give
Far from holy but this matrimony provided the script
To live on and live by, grow up and grow on, get on and get by
So forth and so on  and this here's the last days

I can hear the horns singin', I can see the red sky
I can hear the drum beating, I seen the dead die
How long will they mourn Jesus?
At least I'm saved by my scriptural warn readings

And while leaving you here, believe what you believe in
But you don't want to not believe, believe in seeing
Don't take this here too personal 'cuz I'm just speaking
This is my family on my mind

Sunshine to the rain, when it comes, it goes again
Even when the story ends, just turn the page and begin again
Sunshine on cloudy days, don't hate me I'll never change
Thankful I was made this way, your sunshine for cloudy days
