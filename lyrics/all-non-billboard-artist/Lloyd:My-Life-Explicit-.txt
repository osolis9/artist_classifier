My-Life-Explicit-:Lloyd
Hey baby
This is my life, yeah

This is my life
Baby, ohh
This is life

January 3, 1986, busting out for the fix
Took my first steps
No clue at how physical life gets
'Round uptown Calio projects

Whole life stopped when my daddy got popped
One head shot, he was dead on the spot
Now Im running around with my stomach in knots
Knowing memories is all I got

Ohh, nobody knows about the struggling I been through
Thats why I hustle like I do
I gotta provide for my people
Yeah

And nigga, I done worked too hard
I done came too far to lose
Cant stay still, gotta stay on the move
Leave every day with a point to prove

This is my life
Baby, ohh
This is life

This is my life
Baby, ohh
This is life

Mama jumped ship
Hoping shit gone change
Now Im a-town bound nigga down for the grain
Im feeling like Im loosing my sane

'Cause niggas 'round me been using cocaine
Now my dreams of fortune and fame wont be slain
Just gotta except that Im on the road that was chose from above
Nigga, love is pain

Ohh, nobody knows about the struggling I been through
Thats why I hustle like I do
I gotta provide for my people
Yeah

And nigga, I done worked too hard
I done came too far to lose
Cant stay still, gotta stay on the move
Leave every day with a point to prove

This is my life
Baby, ohh
This is life

This is my life
Baby, ohh
This is life

I go and know you been waiting for a long time
Shorty keep a strong grind
Never give up the sun, dont shine
See Im where I belong now, yeah

Just never ever lose perspective
'Cause if the shit hits the fan and times get hectic
Ill fall to my knees and thank God that Im blessed with
The strength to hold on and deliver the message, so

Ohh, nobody knows about the struggling I been through
Thats why I hustle like I do
I gotta provide for my people
Yeah

And nigga, I done worked too hard
I done came too far to lose
Cant stay still, gotta stay on the move
Leave every day with a point to prove

This is my life
Baby, ohh
This is life
