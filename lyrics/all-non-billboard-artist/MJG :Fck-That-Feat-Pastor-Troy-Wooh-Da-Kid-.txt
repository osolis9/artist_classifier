Pimp tight, pimp J, G just started rappin
Trappers keep trappin, bitches keep strippin
Smokers keep smoking, sippers keep sippin
I’m a bonified, crip right, in front of the club
I’m a V I P, in this bitch they show me love
I be released, 3 bottles of Hen before I’m buzzed
Damn I’m only 45 and it’s fresh out of the club
And I feel like ain’t nobody that can stop me
My killers hang with killers, my posy got a posy
My homies on pointin, at least the ones I brought with me
Got all them hoes, out there getting them hundreds and the 50’s
Came in bout clear, when I left I can’t remember
Like a tree I fell with, down like timber
But I still go hard, never was a pretender
And you pussy ass niggas need to change or shimmer

Okay, all black leather, pocket full of cheddar
I got that Beretta, make me disrespect ya
PT Cruiser, Vietnam vet
Hanging in this here with these choppas on deck
The check I chase it, just cognac –don’t waste it
You know that I’m gutta, a real motherfucker
I don’t play with busters, I don’t play with lames
I live something foreign and I’m switchin lanes
The bitch know where I came
Them niggas know where I live
Them bitches know that I’m game
And I’m strapped to death
I’m never bout myself
I only got my boys
Them hundred fire clips and them automatic toys
Beatin down the block, bitches on my jock
She lookin at my ring, she lookin at my watch
I’m lookin at the clock cuz I’m about to split
And go and get the Glock, nigga fuck that shit

Swag on, what the fuck?
Shoes on, what are those?
Chain on, how’d you get it?
Diamonds on extra froze
It’s another body bag, bring that yellow tape (adios)
My strap is like a 8-0-8 the way it’s shaped
To brick the block hot, they want bronze with monopoly
Have my young boys running through your property
All my lil niggas stay on GO
2 shots, close range, like a free throw
I put that on dunk, I ain’t letting up
Like a motherfucker pointer, I’m just settin up
For my time, when I make it to the tucky top
Tryina block? I’mma make you swallow every shot

I be like fuck that shit, fuck that shit
