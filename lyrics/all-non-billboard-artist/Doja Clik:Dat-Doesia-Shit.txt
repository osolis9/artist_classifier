Dat-Doesia-Shit:Doja Clik
I'm just chillin'
Bein' a g about the game
Suckas playa hate cause young ren is catchin' fame
Recognize i am the g that's on the rise
Next thing you know is your dead body catchin' flies
Hella dead with two big hot ones in the head
No murder weapon cause the killa fled
Murderer i am the killa on the loose
Pencil sag my click is sucker proof (ugh)
Eat a dick if you was jealous of my click
Doja shit got playa hatas on the dick
Sucka free bitches be cool with me (fool)
Rip to the g's that 6 feet deep
2-0-9 is where i'm peelin' caps
Whoride a motherfucker bro
Doja clik straight hustlas on the go (ugh)
That doja shit that's on hit
Comin' up in this game and gettin' much respect
Hatas talk on the jock, now who's the one in check
Dank and drank in my blood and every thangs alright
Makin' snaps, doin' these raps, and mo sleep when i'm high
Think aboiut the days i lived and how she came to be
Old in change from them days cause now it's worse you see
Stay up fool, it's all good, that's what i tell my folks
Tryin' to survive, stay alive, hard times it ain't no joke
In the city, ain't no pitty, for a fuck up slip
2-0-7 all the time, on my toes i tip
When i tweek, devil speak in the chime and deep
Fightin' black gangsters tryin' to take me in my fuckin' sleep
Now you might say i'm crazy
But in my mind you'll find
The type of life that's given, brought up livin' in this 2-0-9
Makin' mail on the sale now i gotta ball
Don't believe, ask your bitch, i know that trick'll tell
Too many bustas on the dick now
We used to be t up g
But now you see is doja shit for l-i-f-e
Triple x gangsters is a old thang

Fat one

Straight up 2 dog
To the fuckin' floor

Hold me to the front door
I want to get drunk till i cant stand no more
And that's the doja shit that's on hit
Everyday, doja clik forever takin' trips to the bay
To show my tape, i can't come fake like a bitch
