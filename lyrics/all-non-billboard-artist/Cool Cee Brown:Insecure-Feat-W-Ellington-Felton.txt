Magnificent

who compares to you
who set the stars in their place
you who come the reiging seas
that came crushing over me

who compares to you
who you greet the morning light
the hope of all the earth
is rest assured in your grace now

you are magnificent
eternally
wonderful
glorious
Jesus
no one ever will compare to you Jesus

when the evening failed
you comfort song and joys
as the morning raise

we your children
give you praise

you are magnificent
eternally
wonderful
glorious
Jesus
no one ever will compare to you Jesus

you are magnificent
eternally
wonderful
glorious
Jesus
No one ever will compare to you Jesus

no one ever will compare to you Jesus
