Tear-Down-These-Walls:Verse
Did we learn anything from all of this
Or did we lose sight
because we fell short and missed out?
It was pain that made us try
To get to kill that way of living
TEAR DOWN THESE WALLS
We need to spark a revolution in our minds
TEAR DOWN THESE WALLS
We don't want to fall short this time
TEAR DOWN THESE WALLS
We need to spark a revolution in our minds
I though we had escaped
But now amongst us lies another wall
waiting to be torn down
It's keeping us from destiny
It's keeping us from everything
We don't want to fall short this time
Can you help me
TEAR DOWN THESE WALLS
We need to spark a revolution in our minds
TEAR DOWN THESE WALLS
And I don'y want to fall short this time
