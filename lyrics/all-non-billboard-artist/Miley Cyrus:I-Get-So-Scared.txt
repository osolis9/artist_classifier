[Verse 1]
They say love grows, but I've only seen it die
I'm too young to feel like I'm runnin' out of time

[Chorus 1]
I get so scared
Thinkin' I'll never get over you
I'll always be making a compromise
No matter what I do, ooh
And maybe I'll never get over you

[Verse 2]
I've heard no one controls what happens in our lives
The universe gets to decide, our future is written up here in the sky

[Chorus 2]
And I get so scared
Thinkin' I'll never get over you
Everything I've imagined
And none of our plans coming true

[Bridge]
I met someone new and now I'm scared to go all the way
I hear you in my mind and can't let go of what you used to say
I'm freakin', it's repeating' when you said there'll never be a day
When letting go feels like before, tonight we're tryin' anyway

[Chorus 3]
And I get so scared
Thinkin' they'll all be just like you
All the ways that you hurt me
And all of the shit you put me through

[Outro]
But maybe
They'll all be just like you
Or maybe, theyâ€™ll never come close to you
So maybe, I'll never get over you
Baby
