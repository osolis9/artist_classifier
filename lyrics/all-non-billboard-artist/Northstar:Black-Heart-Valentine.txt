Black-Heart-Valentine:Northstar
Knock the ice up off my bed
Cut back you hand, cut back so I can
Bleed a little smile
That's all that's left when heaven splits in two
On a bridge a phantom love
Kiss and shove
Have I slept it off?
I've been awake for too long

All this time
there's a hole in my ceiling where dreams escape
(Right above my head)
I'll take a holiday
I'm sick of feeling this way

So just cut off the lights awhile
And kiss me like you wanted to
And then I'll sing in style
Like a black heart valentine pill
I need it but just keep it
I have slept it off
And I've been awake for too long

All this time
There's a hole in my ceiling where dreams escape
(Right above my head)
I'll take a holiday
I'm sick of feeling this way

Well what did it say?
I forgot to read the label
I forgot to read the label
I forgot what it said
But I need it cause I'm not sleeping anymore

And I will breathe my hands will shake
Please blow a kiss for heaven's sake
Her martyr's smile that's plastic and fake
I'm classic and late
I'm plastic and fake
