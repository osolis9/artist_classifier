Dominoes:Howie D
Laying my heart down
Holding to what is coming
I came to win it
Is all about you now

I got your love, can't deny it
You are one in a million
You got me playing
Over and over and over

You got me playing
Over and over and over
Tell me can you hear the sound
I make to hit the crowd

Dominoes
Nobody can't stop me now
Every time you come around
