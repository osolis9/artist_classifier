Walking-Tightropes:Ivens
Alright alright
Ok

Aiyyo, we live life walking on a thin line
Love, hate, underground and big time
Try not to get caught up in the rip tide
Bedroom rapper writing in dim lights
Plutonic making beats way through midnight
Rumours lerk but we work with an inside insight
They wanna big divide fist fight
I'm gonna bring my live-die approach
While they sit by with their king size smokes, with a big smile
Life drifts by in floats and so ya know
It's all politics, real politics, work politics, school politics, friendship politics
Bullies on the block try'na force you to follow quick
More love, more hate we choose to acknowlege this self-approved scholarship
In the face of a hollowtip we sit back and wait for what tomorrow brings

"MC's walk the walk but they can't talk the rhyme"

We all walk the tightropes
They may try'n shoot down all of our high hopes
Everytime I fall still holding a biro
We pick ourselves up and we make a side note
"I walk the tightrope"

"I walk the tightrope"

Fanbase growing, showing support
Handshake exchange though I know they deserve more
The pillars who put fun back into the sport
Didn't sell Hunger Pains, still played it in the store
It means more when they show off their teeth
Got a smile that leaves a permenant crease from cheek to cheek
Each reach just a volunteer's hand up
Achievement speaked, believe I will stand up
Pull down my socks and then pull my pants up
All the while their try'na leave me handcuffed
Should be amped up, not getting pushed down
Reflect, double check now take alook around
New job, new born, new car, new uniform, new heart, new body, new start
New dawn, your ambition is sitting in the food court
Move forward, take what's yours and just cruise forth

"One Step Ahead of ya'
"I walk the tightrope"
"Walk in a line straight stuck doin the blind thing"

"I walk the tightrope"

Wait a second mate you should be happy here
Tonight we're try'na celebrate with a beer
But it appears you're just try'na interfere in my inner ear
Try'na say it's not our biggest cheer, c'mon
