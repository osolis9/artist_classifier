Stay-Down:El-P
You know I get down, I'm a downer, heart pounder,
 LOLin', smelling like Sarin
 Felony forecast: el is, dressed to the nines like a target,
 Dressed like a bullseye for a blind archer
 Heart of piranha, swimming where the blood chums water
 Lark in the darkness watching, I got this boombox burner boy hot sh*t
 Burn like an LA sunset, colorful, toxic, snuff stuff, deadly and erotic
 Walk like a man not a product, run like a strumpet,
 Talk to the hand sock puppet
 Look at them sky write: "f*ck it, we heart nothin',
 We don't have a tear for your bucket",
 Life's but a pageant, that ain't on no deep sh*t,
 Try to pull the curtain back crack goes police whip
 Here come the stage mums, dress your little whores to display them, 
 Cutting through my brain like a ray gun
 Telling you these f*ckers are shameless, Obama to Reagan,
 Look at how they bent to their training
 Why would I be angered, not when I can chemically hang
 Glide, angle, face dive mangled, anguish
 Notice I maraud odd language, roll a joint
 Hit a fraud god 'till he vanquish, bonus point

 I'm thrown
 With all this chrome and
 You sound like you're drowning
 Drown drown drown drown
 Get down, stay down

 You know I get bent I'm a bender,
 Futura-Ra-ma-Dom-inant gene gone bad and
 Passed along to my blood stream pumping madness,
 Pour a little hell down hatch
 It's standard practice how to detach
 From a white noise planet with a dispatch
 Straight from command to throw haymaker
 Plus land it, never take a win for granted
 Remember the pitch that I sang with to anoint masses,
 Before mass graves hatch like magic,
 Everybody bows to the bastards,
 Anthem acid dispatchers get rancid,
 Fact of the matter I graph and track hapless,
 Live in a mirage it's hard to not crack kid
 What's that? Pass it
 Wanna watch? I'ma smoke till I'm bat sh*t
 Choke like a champion

 I'm blown
 Like I've been thrown now
 I sound like I'm drowning
 Drown drown drown drown
 Get down, stay down

 I'm blown
 Like I've been thrown now
 Down down down down
 Get down, stay down
