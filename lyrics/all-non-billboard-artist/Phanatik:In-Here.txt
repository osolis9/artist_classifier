In-Here:Phanatik
You want truth then that's what you'll get
Milk it til it's done and then tilt it to the side
Just to get the rest out
Come back with souls every time we conquest out
Bombed your house with actual facts from Messiah
Sent you a fax to match the patch from my tire
Made tracks, perhaps you'll follow
The road to the cross
Take the crossroads if you feel hollow get filled up
More than a tank full
Meet Christ and end up truly thankful
From your heels up to the top of ya
Concealed the truth like a duce duce
Let loose while it Hasan chopped through ya
Had all that lip, you was straight big and bad
Til Christ touched ya hip, and left you zig-zag like Israel
You was stubborn and hard
Now you governed by God and all is well
Fishtail from turning too fast
180 or smash and burn into ash like
Crash dummies, instead of following Christ
You loved the pleasures of life and ice and cash money
Now that's funny, no it's not I'm sensitive
But God's Son was sent to give us a chance to repen
To live and that don't appeal to ya
How should I deal with ya
Knowing that God serves more soul food than Silvia's

In here, we got x-thugs in here
We got, x-crips, x-bloods in here
We got, x-pimps in here
We got x-x rated chicks in here
We got, nice guys, wise guys in here
We got, good girls, hood girls in here
We got, all types in here
That's right, they hid in Christ they disappeared

Like EST and 3Xs Dope or Nas in these rhyme
We wrote we hope you meet the greatest man alive
And get caught up in His family ties
And that all y'all wise guys would come to have ya plans revised
Why wait to give God your life later
Before then you might slip and fall like a ice skater
You say Christ aint your type of flavor
He never claimed to be, He came to be your type of Savior
Cried for you, was tried for you
Buy unjust judges came here just to justify poor you
Died in your place
Two hand slam dunker, right and left punctured told death "in your face"
Took manikins, breathed life in them and revived man again
The champion of the camp we in
Told sin and death you can not win
Now rules on a throne with no known plans of vanishing
Hand to Him, all things before you wreck 'em
Even small kings reject Him and they won't play nice
So get ready for judgment day twice
First the church and then the whole earth
It's time to pay the price
One group will pay Him and the others God will pay them
And the church all over the earth heard and said "amen"

In here, we got x-thugs in here
We got, x-crips, x-bloods in here
We got, x-pimps in here
We got x-x rated chicks in here
We got, nice guys, wise guys in here
We got, good girls, hood girls in here
We got, all types in here
That's right, they hid in Christ they disappeared

I've done enough dirt to make me dirty enough
To have to shower til clocks in eternity bust
Unworthy of trust, full of lust quick to cuss out
Turn my internal lights on
Nothing but darkness rushed out the light bulb
Til Christ called, asked me to follow Him
Cleaned up my act, lit up my path like a halogen
Gave me a new Father and showed me He was sovereign
Changed what my aim was, plus what I was hollering
Took away my old ways quicker than a dollar spends
Grabbed me by my collar and said "don't even bother them"
But some of those ways stuck around I wallowed in
Sin that almost had me about to drown on the shallow end
He's sandblasting me making me smooth as aloe
He said He wanted to reach Hip-hop and I said I'll go in

In here, we got x-thugs in here
We got, x-crips, x-bloods in here
We got, x-pimps in here
We got x-x rated chicks in here
We got, nice guys, wise guys in here
We got, good girls, hood girls in here
We got, all types in here
That's right, they hid in Christ they disappeared
