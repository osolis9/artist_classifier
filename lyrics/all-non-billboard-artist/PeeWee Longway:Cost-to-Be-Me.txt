Cost-to-Be-Me:PeeWee Longway
See that's why ya'll need acquaintance, fuckin' Peewee Longway came through.
She has never seen a nigga like me around the club
Saying I want a nigga that's cool
She hear bitching and bossing, want a guy that'll take her out the hood.

It cost to be like me,
It costs to be a baller in the hood.
It cost to be a nigga like me
It costs to be a baller in the hood.

It cost to be a nigga like me
It costs to be a baller in the hood.
Gt my picture house and a loft in the wood.
Frostie's so fossie, I love it when she do it,
Looking like bossy, she catch her way good.
Long way so slashing, I put it on wood,
Trapping Obresse and I change them like lightning
Lightning's ok, what you mean she not like it?
She ain't never seen a nigga like me.
Cruising with stooges, with stupid hair watches,
Flipping a preacher like sticking hair botches.
It ain't ok if ya'll loose it like me,
Skeet on her titty, too freaky for me
I can go pinch her, she feeling Louie.

Yeah, it cost to be like me,
Even impostors can [?] at me
Small like a roster when I role O.G.
Chickens on pasta's when me and Milos feast.
Even no mud monster analyze me,
Pop the kind of bill for a nigga like me.
I wanna trump, I send Sundays with wheat,
It cost to be like me. No way!

Yes, yeah, I know, the niggar came passing on drugs
Like he living cool. She asked me why ya'll niggas hanging in the street and why Little Peewee looking so good?
She have never seen a nigga like me around the club
Saying I want a nigga that's cool
She hear bitching and bossing, want a guy that'll take her out the hood.

Yeah, it cost to be like me,
It costs to be a baller in the hood.
It cost to be a nigga like me
It costs to be a baller in the hood.

I have never seen a nigga like me,
Wave for her like a meal without a turkey they're not serving me,
Fuck a nigga mean, it can never be me,
He giggling Obresse and I'm giggling O.G.
Different between you and me, my G,
I'm from out the Bricks, and you from out the suburbs
I can fucking dunk a bitch and you can try to love her.

You are to different, my bro,
I really wish you were my neighbor,
Like no one other, you be my destiny love,
Bitch, I'm a boss and I'm fucking your freaking head.
It costs to be a real deal boss and nigga
Colossal living, you ought to go, diddles.
Pass on biz, I got more, I got more,
It ain't no pressure on this case.
She upper excellence, nigga so fabulous,
Just thought you know best, she don't look at me though,
She's from West Chrissam, she met Michael J.,
My bitch from Bermuda, she know that she's bad.
Look on yur computer, long way [?]
Audio 7, it came with a hash bag.
I keep it to it, the streets a fuckin' nightmare
I came, I don't trench a slinger an eight of crack.

Yes, yeah, I know, the niggar came passing on drugs
Like he living cool. She asked me why ya'll niggas hanging in the street and why Little Peewee looking so good?
She have never seen a nigga like me around the club
