Mr-Governor-feat-Akie-Bermiss-:Soul Khan
They’re killing me tonight
They are killing me tonight
They are murdering, murdering
Murdering me tonight
We went from voltage to dosage like that's humane
As the hourglass passes its last few grains
We still add new names to death row that echo
From holman
to folsom, how can you claim
That we're staying on the high ground
When we take another life out
Without so much as raising up an eyebrow
Well maybe some of us
But meanwhile the rest of y’all chill as we restrain a mother's child down
Strapped but disarmed, they’re jabbing his arms with catheters
His family’s hearts are cracking apart as activists
Protest with candles and signs hoping this man will survive
Unless the capital calls for the miraculous
This ain’t the kind of thing you need to stop and ask oprah
It’s power that we can’t allow atop a man’s shoulder
It’s about time I cried out and brought my hands closer
Remembering the final words of shaka sankofa
They’re killing me tonight
They are killing me tonight
They are murdering, murdering
Murdering me tonight
Mr. governor, we’ve discovered a
Body of evidence don’t cover us
In that black mask and make us
Make us turn out the light
Now even if they’re guilty beyond reasonable doubt
It ain’t like killing em’ll ever even this shit out
If you’d fallen where they’ve fallen, you might see another route
Instead of something more than murder when that needle’s coming out
We’ve seen too many moments that are worth second looks
The first breath he took, the first step he took
A grave is a grave and a death is a death
But y’all forget about it as soon they’re first getting booked
See, i’m just stating the past ethics and same words

I can’t imagine that sad sentence that they heard
They showed a kinda mercy to killers they ain’t
Earned
Wrongly accused or proven and shut cases
You wanna execute ‘em, remove me from your playlist
Their your neighbors, lord save us
Nah, fuck it you ain’t even try to save troy davis
They’re killing me tonight
They are killing me tonight
They are murdering, murdering
Murdering me tonight
Mr. governor, we’ve discovered a
Body of evidence don’t cover us
In that black mask and make us
Make us turn out the ligh
