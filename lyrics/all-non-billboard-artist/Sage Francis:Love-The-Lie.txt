Love-The-Lie:Sage Francis
You gotta love the lie
You gotta love the lie

Love, life, love, god, girls and lies
I can't hear through those veneers
But you keep speaking with those pearly whites

Love the life that you live if it gives love back
And we gotta stay together for the kids
If you want to disappear don't announce it
Vanish in thin air and bounce, quick

Fix the cowlick, slick your hair back
Ride the rim bare back, you stared at
Lady Godiva might have been an exhibitionist
I'm not here to judge voyeuristic fetishes

If nobody looked, it's a closed book
You could put your hang ups on a coat hook
I'm from a puritanical land where they burn witches
I'm the result of a welfare running up your sickness

Joy never came, Jesus never helped
We were all to blame, god beat us with a belt
If I heard your name, I'd retreat into myself
I won't hurt your name, I'll keep it to myself with

Love, life, love, god, girls and lies
I can't hear through those veneers
But you keep speaking through those pearly whites

No legacy to claim, no enemies to squelch
No chemical imbalance that could remedy itself
[Incomprehensible] for the parents medicine is on the shelf
Put the trophy in the spotlight, watch as it melts

Metal wouldn't survive, plastic is cheaper
Ran into the fire, she asked me to leave her
I did what I could with the wood and the flammables
Stood with the good little animals, ran with the bulls

Soot on my hands that were full
Put the good book on the mantle
Burn, baby, burn, you could serve as a candle
Last thing I heard was her on the piano
Last thing I saw was her being herself
By beating herself, to see if it could help

If I heard your name, I'd retreat into myself
I won't hurt your name, I'll keep it to myself with

Love, life, love, god, girls and lies
I can't hear through those veneers
But you keep speaking through those pearly whites

Love the lie
Love the lie
Love the lie
Love the lie

The killer never came, Jesus never helped
We were all to blame, god beat us with a belt
If I heard your name, I'd retreat into myself
I won't hurt your name, I'll keep it to myself

No legacy to claim, no enemies to squelch
No chemical imbalance that could remedy itself
[Incomprehensible] for the parents medicine is on the shelf
Put the trophy in the spotlight, watch as it melts with love

Love the lie
Love the lie
Love the lie
Love the lie
Love the lie
Love the lie
