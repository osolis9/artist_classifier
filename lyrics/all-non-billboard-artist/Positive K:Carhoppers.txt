Uhh, uhh, I call girls carhoppers
'Cause I make em hit notes like they was singin' at the operas
May I say, on any day, yeah they with it
They're in a Yugo, if you got the Yugo kitted
(Say what?)

Stand by your man, yes, that's what they all claim
You don't have a car?  Then you're fucked up in the game
They'll walk by ya, and say, â€½Hiyaâ€
Is he drivin' 'cause he cute? Oh no, his shit is tired
(Oh no)

And they'll turn like you got the virus
'Cause you didn't have a car or the one had there wasn't fliest
But for the record I'm not trickin'
But you can call me Timex, 'cause I'll still take the lickin'

So if you're hot and bothered or in a frenzy
I'll pop, 'The Mack' soundtrack in the Benz
And you can tell me how you choose me baby
Baby, this no time for you to act crazy

You can't play me, not like Play-Doh
Don't leave me for the kid honey in the Laredo
(Speak on it)
But if you gots to go, you gotta go, I can't stop her
That's the lifestyles of the carhoppers

Mmm, uhh, a yeah, baby, things is kinda swivel
Ever since my dad put me up on his Rivi-era
Now I see things much clearer
When I'm in my ride, women wanna be nearer to the
Show stopper, yeah, the profiteered

Uhh, excuse me honey, it's not nice to stare
Dare, if you wanna get with this here
Put on your best gear and step to the rear
I'll be there say, about 10:30

And know that don't be late honey
'Cause my beeper is loaded
And, if you're not there by the toot of the horn
(Kick it)

Uhh, now you think things is right 'cause she's on
The next man's gooseneck and suckin his exhaust pipe
She's got him and he's got an erection
Just because of his fuel injection, system

All before yeah, she used to diss him
Now she knows money on down to his pistons
And his engine or let's say his chassis
Just blow your horn and she'd run like Lassie

Or better yet, she'd flip like Kujo
If you got a Jag, or a Porsche Turbo
(Once again, break it down)
They got more promises than Thomases

And I think they better go and call, Hoppers Anonymous
But I know, where to send 'em
Ah to the Hyundai dealer to gets the Benz emblem
