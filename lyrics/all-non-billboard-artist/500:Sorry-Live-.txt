Sorry-Live-:500
I want to be sorry,
But I can't because it something I didn't do,
I see your hurting and crying too,
You sit there and act like it doesn't bother you,
You can talk on your phone all you want,
But I need you to see I'm sorry.

Sorry is all I can say,
I see what you are going through,
But I can't say I feel your pain,
I wish I could erase everything that was said,
But all I can do is sit here and act like a fool.

I can't help what I think,
But I can stop things I do,
If it makes it any easier for you,
I would give up my dream,
I would just let it be as I can see,
But you sit there and don't talk to me.

Sorry is all I can say,
I see what you are going through today,
But I can't say I feel your pain,
I wish I could erase everything that was said,
But all I can do is sit here and act like a fool.

You laugh because I say I wish I could help,
Your smile brings tears to my eyes,
I guess it because,

Sorry is all I can say,
I see what you went through,
But I can't say I felt your pain,
I wish I could erase everything that was said,
But all I could do was sit there and act like a fool.

Do you realize how sorry I feel for you.
