Pistolgrip-Pump-A-Cappella-:Volume 10
I was raised in the hood called what the dif? what the.
The brothers in the hood be Chivalrous
So i rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin it
Full life living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack... up
On my lap its on your lips so track shot
A steel dick more clip for pump but
All im saying there aint no question who the man is
In my civic or in this showbiz
I shit a fool, kill the fool
Come on what you say?
I think i can take care of all you muthafuckaz don't delay right away

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Fools be jackin' other fools, but they ain't be jackin mine!

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times, right?
Cause tricks be out for your blind side
Never understood it, but remember i showed you
That in the nineties you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If your ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals
If you ain't got none, bitch, I got a million styles!
Whose around me?
Are we getting along? we family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back kid
Just dont be pointing one of them guns, aiight man...

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Fools be jackin' other fools, but they ain't be jackin mine!

Rhymin' iz a sinch, sonavabitch, I'm rich!
But that don't mean you can get me, cuz all my peoplez is pimps!
Playaz, hustlaz, pimpz, all been through the filter...
I hang wit' my doggz man, fuck a gorilla
Iller, coddaba, hilla, bings...
Show me have a enough steam, to blow me up, run up, what up, shutup!
A trick get the buck-shotz
Your daughter get the luv, a lot, yer outtie, at the cemetary...
Man, she loves me, and not a single solitary, witness, to the party
And if you didn't know, should've asked somebody...
