Avril-Lavigne:Falling Down
If fear's what makes us decide
Our future journey
Well, I'm not along for a ride
'Cause I'm still yearning

To try and touch the sun
My fingers burning
Before you're old you are young
Yeah, I'm still learning

I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me

Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down

I'm standing out in the street
The earth is moving
I feel it under my feet
And I'm still proving

That I can stand my ground
And my feet aren't there
Haven't washed my hair
To be lost before you are found
Don't mean you're losing

I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me

Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down

Some day I'll live in a house
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
But you know that's not for now
And for now I'm falling

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Yeah, eee, yeah, eee, yeah

I am falling down
Try and stop me
It feels so good to hit the ground
You can watch me

Fall right on my face
It's an uphill human race
And I am falling down

I am falling down
  (I'm falling down, I'm falling)
  (Falling, falling, falling, falling)

It feels so good to hit the ground
  (I'm falling, I'm falling down)
(I am falling)

Falling down
(I'm falling)
