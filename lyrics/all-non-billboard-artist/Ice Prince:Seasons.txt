Shots flowing like grenades and I don't know the reason
Shots, I pray to God that I don't go to prison
Am steady talking to Jehovah cos I know I need him
Life style of the rich and famous I'm tRNA pick
So I can cop me designers get me a finer chick
Yeah, this rappers choking like sis
While I was tRNA figure this sh! t out like am a scientist

They hating on me from school I'm flying out to Brazil

Cos he gave me resurrection what's exactly what I needed and i
Still rep my city hommie till day
I've been around the world and it feels great
Barely getting fatty off this real cake
Rappers aiming at me while I'm aiming at the bills gate
I've seen the rise and I've seen mistakes
Hommie, I've seen the rats and I've seen the snakes
You know, I've seen the grass in my little past
But my little passion of rap had a little grace, amen.
