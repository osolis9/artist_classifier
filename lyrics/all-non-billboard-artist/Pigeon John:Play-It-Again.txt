Play-It-Again:Pigeon John
Play it again
Play it again for me
(Play it again)
Can't stop me let it al hang out
Oh, that's what I'm talking about
Turn it on, turn it up, turn it out
Oh, I think I'm feelin' it now
Slick talkin', moonwalkin', son of a gun
Find in between handclappin' a drum

Brand new me
Brand new day
And the whole world is spinnin' my way
Play it again
Like it's never been done before
Play it again
Can you someday give me some more
Start me up, whatch me move
Ain't nothing like the way I do
Play it again for me
Oh, you got me feelin so brand new
(Play it again)
Play it again for me
(Play it again)

Come on baby let me hear that sound
Oh, that's what I'm talking about
On a roll, and we ain't slowing down
Oh, I think I'm feelin' it now
Hip hoppin, show stoppin' out on the run
Pedal to the metal because I'm chasin' the sun
In the right place if you're lookin' for fun
Got the recipe on the tip of my tongue
It goes, one, two, three to the four
Now shake, that, thing on the floor

'Cause it's a brand new me
Brand new day
And the whole world is spinnin' my way
Play it again
Like it's never been done before
Play it again
Can you someday give me some more
Start me up, whatch me move
Ain't nothing like the way I do
Play it again for me
Oh, you got me feelin so brand new
(Play it again)
Play it again for me
(Play it again)

Play it again now

Start me up

Come on

Oh, I think I'm feelin' it now

'Cause it's a brand new me
Brand new day
And the whole world is spinnin' my way
Play it again
Like it's never been done before
Play it again
Can you someday give me some more
Start me up, whatch me move
Ain't nothing like the way I do
Play it again for me
Oh, you got me feelin so brand new
(Play it again)
Play it again for me
(Play it again)

You got me feelin'so brand new
(Play it again)
