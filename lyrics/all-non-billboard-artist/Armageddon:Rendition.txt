Rendition:Armageddon
World of pain - universe of sorrow
Waiting for light - but there's no tomorrow
Eternal darkness, moving through the cosmos
A fish against the stream, I run against the grain

I walk inside
A generated mind
Visions I long to see
Renditions of pain

Can you see it, society in rapture
Of their infernal knowledge, hypnotised by their own flame
To live and die - at the same time
Reborn without a soul, without a conscious weight

I walk inside
A generated mind
Visions I long to see
Renditions of pain

A violent mind
Removed from life
Five billion years technology
Collect me into darkness

I walk inside
A generated mind
Visions I long to see
Renditions of pain
Pain
Pain
Pain
