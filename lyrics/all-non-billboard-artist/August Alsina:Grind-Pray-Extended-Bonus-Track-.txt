Grind-Pray-Extended-Bonus-Track-:August Alsina
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray to lord my soul to take

My cup full, I'm laid back, I'm bout mine, you know that
I'm rag racin', zoom zoom, in a rush to get all that
Cross my heart, I die hard, come through your hood, in all black
If you real, you'd recognize

All I do is grind, and pray
Riding through the streets all day
I'm juuuuuust (gettin' to this money, gettin'-gettin' to this money)
(Gettin' to this money, gettin'-gettin' to this money)

My mama callin' on my line
Ain't talked in a couple days
Cause I got a lot on my mind
Tryna flip this up a couple ways

Everyday, I'm on it
365 I'm grindin', prayin', yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

I gotta get this money
Make this money, make this money on you
(You, you, you you you...)
I gotta get this money
Make this money, make this money on you
I'mma keep grindin', grindin'
I'mma keep griiiiindin'
