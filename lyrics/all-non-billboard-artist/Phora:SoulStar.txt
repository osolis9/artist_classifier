SoulStar:Phora
Last night I had a dream
Of a beautiful day
And like a song
An angel passed my way

She was the embodiment of perfection
With skin like the sky
And her hair was as long as time
Then she turned to me

With her big proud eyes
Her voice flowed like water
And it brought a tear to my eye
And she said to me

Soulstar, oh, youve come
So far from where you've started
Dont be afraid to let your light
Shine on the world

Soulstar, oh, youve come
So far from where you've started
Dont be afraid to let your light
Shine on the world

Soulstar, oh, youve come
So far from where you've started
Dont be afraid to let your light
Shine on the world

Soulstar, oh, youve come
So far from where you've started
Dont be afraid to let your light
Shine on the world
