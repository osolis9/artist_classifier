Wanted-Man:Jimmy Cliff
Woah wowo wowo wowo wowo wowo wowo wowo
I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
I'm on the run, they said I'm a threat to their society
Cos I stand for love and justice, sincerity
The price on my head is getting higher everyday
But I say oh Lord thank you, alhamdulilah, they don't know where I stay
And that's why
I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
I'm on the run, they said that I never never did no wrong
But they wanna cut me down cos I'm strong, strong, strong
Cos I stand for truths and rights
And this they don't like
So they wanna cut me down to get me clean out of sight
But they can't, so
I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
Yes I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
He's a wanted man
He's a wanted man
Said I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
Yes I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
I'm on the run, they said I'm a threat to their society
Cos I stand for love and justice, sincerity
Truth is my defence
And that's no sin
To some it's an offence
That's how I win
And that's how, I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
Yes I'm a wanted, wanted man, he's a wanted man
I stand up for what I believe it's true
Truths and rights stand forever more stand forever
Truths and rights burning inside burning inside...
