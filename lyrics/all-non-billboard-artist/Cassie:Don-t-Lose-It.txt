Don-t-Lose-It:Cassie
Your lipstick stains
Smells like a cheap hotel
Diamond watches and a gold chain
Can't make my frown turn around
The boys always spending all their money on love
The boys always spending all their money on love

They wanna touch it
Taste it see it feel it
Bone it own it yeah yeah
Diamonds are a paper chaser
Get that money yeah yeah

You get high crock a whole bunch of girls
And then cry on top of the world
I hope you have the time of your life
I hope I don't lose it tonight

Your bossed swag
Got 'em drooling like a new born bag
The... is in their eyes
Got 'em blinded by your masquerade
The boys always spending all their money on love
The boys always spending all their money on love

They wanna touch it
Taste it see it feel it
Bone it own it yeah yeah
Diamonds are a paper chaser
Get that money yeah yeah

You get high crock a whole bunch of girls
And then cry on top of the world
I hope you have the time of your life
I hope I don't lose it tonight
