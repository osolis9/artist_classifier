My-Other-Gun:Ne-Yo
Hold me down with a thousand pounds on the shoulder
Lift me up despite the stones, rocks, boulders
Soft and strong, right and wrong, anxious ,patient 
In her eyes ride or die ain't just a statement oh

So much more than right or die
She'll get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive
And I know if situations go right
Then she's right there in the hostel by my side

That's my other gun
That's my other eye
That's who got my back
When the world ain't on my side
She my other gun
Should I go to war
Holding me down
That's what she there for

She my other gun
She my other gun

Put me first even when I'm on my moment
Knows me well can't front her she see right through me
You rub my hand hold me when this world is troubling
Settle for that long you'll never want or need for nothing girl

So much more than right or die
She'll get on the trigger or take the wheel and drive
And I know if situations go right
Then she's right there in the hostel by my side

That's my other gun
That's my other eye
That's who got my back
When the world ain't on my side
She my other gun
Should I go to war
Holding me down
That's what she there for

She's always locked and loaded
Ready for anything
She got me fully covered
I'm glad she's on my team
Custom grip perfect bid
All she's pictures me
Her and me all I need
Makes us hard to be
My other gun

That's my other gun
That's my other eye
That's who got my back
When the world ain't on my side
She my other gun
Should I go to war
Holding me down
That's what she there for
She my other gun
She my other gun
And I love 
I love you baby
Said I love you
Said I love you baby
