The-Art-Of-Raw:Rhyme Asylum
[Verse 1: Possessed]

Got off to a flying start
Manoeuvring two hijacked jets into Isengard
Catch a lightning charge
And any sand that’s beneath my feet solidifies to glass
I’m insane
My lion heart roars from behind the bars of my rib cage
A formidable force
Got two souls and they fight for control of my physical form
Tighten the rope
Commit suicide and scare you to death from the sight of my ghost 
My right hand has a mind of its own 
At night I wake to find it holding knives to my throat
Fuck mics all I need is one knife
To cut lives short, contract killer - unsigned 
Vampiric blood type
Make you throw up the knots in your stomach to leave you tongue tied  

[Verse 2: Psiklone]

My sick life's worse than worst death
Dashed a flick knife at the midwife before I took my first breath 
Rising stars
Burn the planet till it turns to ashes with a magnifying glass
Reverse down the righteous path
My saliva’s fundamental to tranquilizer darts
Flashbacks to a violent past
Last time I saw and eye sore I sawed my eyes in half 
Take drugs with no conscience 
Pupils dilate like columbine killers with slow watches 
The Christ corpse hangs up in my house
Free running without my feet touching the ground
Minotaur lost in the maze
So high when I throw us both off a cliff we'll go opposite ways
Fuck physical harm
I’d psychologically rip you apart but my rhymes'll probably split you in half

[Chorus]

It’s my time in this, my time
My time my time in this, we get raw
It’s my time to spit, my time 
My time my time to spit we get raw
It’s my time in this, my time
My time my time in this, we get raw
It’s my time to spit, my time 
My time my time to spit we get raw

[Verse 3: Possessed]

If my name is put in a verse
You frame is put in a hearse and layed six foot in the dirt (Word)
Seven stars in my right hand
Highlander lifespan, burn stacks of Mein Kampf
Psiklone and Possessed
Raise the bar ‘till every one we drop is over your head
Annville style, broken your neck
You are wack mediocre at best - NEXT!

[Verse 4: Psiklone]

Under the streets, hunting for meat
I'll turn a blind eye, into one that can see
Split identity crisis
I’m stepping in cyphers with the breath control of adrenalin divers
On a path to supremacy
The universe expands into empty parts of my memory
At the speed I’m moving
Within several seconds I undergo eons of natural evolution

[Repeat Chorus]
