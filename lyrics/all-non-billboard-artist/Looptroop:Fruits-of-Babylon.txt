Fruits-of-Babylon:Looptroop
I grew from babylon soil,
born to consume and destroy
i know that cash is king
i breath cocaine, bleed oil
made to rise above all, success' my ultimate goal
i do what it takes and bring you down if i fall
handle my business with war, attack the poor, while praising the lord
raised to be raw, but act polite - for the show
let the cameras roll, i got no doubt or regrets
life off thousands of deaths, keep no promises - only threats
You politicians preaching your vision of the truth
never cared about us and our point of view
cus your campaigns only promote the killing fields
children cry but you do't hear,
people die but you can't see
cus war is big biz the big guys get rich
livin' off the poor and gain money on sick kids
it's a show for those who can afford the price
but turn that shit off i won't let you gamble with my life
We don't need a weather man to know wich way the wind blows
- cold wind blowing
we don't need your politicians to know which way to go
- we don't need you'all
we don't need your teachers, leave the kids alone
- hey leave them alone
and we don't need the poisonous fruits of babylon
Babylon
- always recruiting, plotting
babylon
- but yo, my crew been watching
babylon
- and if your roots forgotten
babylon
- then your fruits will rotten
I drink away my pain, on top of the food cain
the fast life, fast lane, view people as loose change
piss champange, not really hungry - but i'm eating
grow fat for no reason and though it's hot my hearts freezing
Look into the mirror do you see what i see?
i'm a reflection of your actions and will always be
the result of your plans, the breed of your scams
and i'll forever be a prisoner of your land
Hey i'm the good guy, modern man, enlightened, i understand
y'all don't seem to get it, why should i care about a foreign land?
you with me or against me, fight for the love of money
join me in this good life, sell your soul for blood money
We don't need a weather man to know wich way the wind blows
- can't stop the tidal wave
we don't need your politicians to know which way to go
- ya, you misslead us
we don't need your teachers, leave the kids alone
and we don't need the poisonous fruits of babylon
I don't vote, i cut a politician's throat
hang him withe same rope as i do the pope
cus i see the hope in the eyes of our children
i won't go for your bribes or your millions
cus i see no future in the lies and the killings
we all saw what happend to the financial buildings
it's all for a reason wether right or wrong
somebody felt their people had been dying to long
Revenge, retaliation and stupid pride
on both sides
so we keep losing lives
worldwide, i sing this one for our mothers
take a sec to recollect just how much they love us...
We don't need a weather man to know wich way the wind blows
- i know i've said it before
we don't need your politicians to know which way to go
- and i'm gonna say it again
we don't need your teachers, leave the kids alone
- leave the kids alone
and we don't need the poisonous fruits of babylon
Come'on!
Babylon - always recruiting, plotting
babylon - but yo, my crew been watching
babylon - and if your roots forgotten
babylon - then your fruits will rotten
Babylon, recruiting, plotting
babylon, my crew been watching
if your roots forgotten, then your fruits will rotten
