Courage:Breeze
so many times I tried
to hide the hurt inside
thought out the days I couldn take it
tired of being pushed around
couldn't meant to fence this town
had a voice inside afraid to say it
but now I made up my mind
its time
gonna push all my fees aside
and I'm gonna be strong
and I'm gonna keep holding on
till the feelings happened so long
cause I've got courage
and I'm gonna be brave
just no matter how long it takes
I'll be living with no walking brace
cause I've got courage
those days are losing vines
and all those sleepless nights
there's an inner strength I found
inside me
gonna set me free
now I made up my Mind its time

gonna push all my fees aside
and I'm gonna be strong
and I'm gonna keep holding on
till the feelings happened so long
cause I've go courage
and I'm gonna be brave
cause no matter how long it takes

I'll be living with no walking brace

cause I've got courage
all these times that made me feel so bad
never gonna let it hold me back
yeah I'm gonna get back up and shine
making me strong
I'll throw it all
all the hurt has been a lesson but
walking over over these bridges back
found something deep inside of me
now i can be who I always dreamed
and Now I made up my mind
its time
I'm gonna push all me fees aside
and im gonna be stong
and im gonna keep holding on
