Carmen-Queasy-Original-Mix-:Maxim
My vision is distorted by my sleazy mind
To picturesque an image to control this time
My intimate discriminating fears you test
My ignorance that truely feels it knows me best

You have the power but you keep it all to yourself
Your lust is decomposing us

This intricate sincerity is choking me
It's crumbling and crawling all around my feet
It wasn't jump from lie to lie to cover me
But could a bullet tell her just evading me

You have the power but you keep it all to yourself
Your lust is decomposing us

So now you're telling me it's all damn easy
Try to see yourself as carmen queasy
'Cos money making is a wonderful thing
(Money making is a wonderful thing)
But I don't want to be a marketed baby
Try to see yourself as carmen queasy
'Cos money making is a wonderful thing
(Money making is a wonderful thing)

Carmen Queasy, I don't wanna be

Don't wanna be (echoing 4 times)

I'm flinging out some rhythms in a cultural scare
Suffocating, still frustrating like we care
Dissecting all who analyse an empty heart
Just spiting out some more with dreams of calling it art

You have the vision but you keep it all to yourself
Your lust is decomposing us

So now you're telling me it's all damn easy
Try to see yourself as carmen queasy
'Cos money making is a wonderful thing
(Money making is a wonderful thing)
But I don't want to be a marketed baby
Try to see yourself as carmen queasy
'Cos money making is a wonderful thing
(Money making is a wonderful thing)

Money making, money taking
We don't have a choice
But we still have a voice

Antagonists, life is too short
Twist deform and distort
And bring their brains into my seminar
Where there making music making failure

Gotta take back what's mine
(gotta take back)
Keep chocking and holding, provoking
My life style you be smoking

So now you're telling me it's all damn easy
Try to see yourself as carmen queasy
'Cos money making is a wonderful thing
(Money making is a wonderful thing)
But I don't want to be a marketed baby
Try to see yourself as carmen queasy
'Cos money making is a wonderful thing
(Money making is a wonderful thing)

Money making is a wonderful thing
Money making is a wonderful thing
Money making is a wonderful thing
Money making is a wonderful thing
Money making is a wonderful thing
