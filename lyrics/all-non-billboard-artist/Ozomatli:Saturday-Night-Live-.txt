Uhh, imagine
Waking up, solidarity is eveident
Harmony moves, time is irrelevant
People, the places, the message basic
From raise fists to sit-ins, resist the change
Peep the scenario, to the future bro
2020 and some number a year ago
People rose up, governments froze up
Worldwide block party, everybody shows up
Up on roof tops, ghettos and hot spots
People celebratin' no more souls rot
No more bloodshed over false defecit
Even hip-hop gets a fuckin face-lift
The latest fashion, stock market's crashin'
It's saturday, time to get the party crackin'
And if the time and the day is right
The revolution will begin this saturday night

Dip, dive, socialize
Get ready for the saturday night
Dip, dive, socialize
Get ready for the saturday night
Dip (dip), dive, socialize
Get ready for the saturday night

(Hey, hey, hey)
Futuristic, I'm killin 'em every synonym
Sendin' 'em back with syllabal venom up in 'em
Too terrific, epitome of a pendulum
Digital rap, got animal stamina in 'em
Son your soul, and backbone were the clap come from (clap)
Action Jackson, matter-fact we
Move you from the front to the back see
Plug us up and then bump this new phat beat
When it drop, stores oughtta stop on me
Shop 'till ya drop, homey that's not me
Rush an attack from the back on three
Stop on me, shout "World Peace!";
Slide from the block, love peace, oh please!
We don't need bouncers or police
It's saturday night, it's nothin' better
Spread the word, we comin' together
So come on with me now

Dip, dive, socialize
Get ready for the saturday night
Dip, dive, socialize
Get ready for the saturday night
Dip (dip), dive, socialize
Get ready for the saturday night
Dip, dive, socialize
Get ready
