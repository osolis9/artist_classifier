Forget-You:Elijah Blake
Pieces of your heart had been falling
Secrets locked upon me too fine
Instincts told me not to go hauling
And finally you're finding out why

I don't even smoke like this
I don't even get this high
I don't even drink this shit
But imma forget you tonight

I don't even smoke like this
I don't even get this high
I don't even drink this shit
But imma forget you tonight

Everything works out how it's supposed to
Your true colors show all the time
Pain is only temporary
Pills and needles in my mind

I don't even smoke like this
I don't even get this high
I don't even drink this shit
But imma forget you tonight

I don't even smoke like this
I don't even get this high
I don't even drink this shit
But imma forget you tonight, baby yeah
But imma forget you tonight, baby yeah
But imma forget you tonight, baby yeah
But imma forget you tonight, baby yeah
