BE SINGLE (INTERLUDE) LYRICS

I'll never understand how you give your heart to two different people, people
You say you wanna live you life, well that's fine, just break up be single, single
I'll never understand how you give your heart to two different people, people
You say you wanna live you life, well that's fine, just break up be single, single

I ain't have nothing but love for you
I would give you the moon, wait up in your room while you did me dirty
It's gonna be difficult now that's it's over
Whenever you hit me, I ride like your chauffeur
And the sad part is that you said you never change up
I'm a wreck right now, look at all this damage you've done
Told everyone that I was sure
Crazy to make me insecure
So I'm pulling up on you alone
Don't wanna talk on the phone no more
Don't let it go to your head, you did it too many times before
You gotta clean it up, quit asking me what's up
You wasn't thinking 'bout me, when I know who's in your truck
Pick up the hundreds, back to the money, yeah bag check
Thinking I'd sneak around? no, I'm not your last bitch
I've been down too long, if you hear me in this song
Can someone make it make sense to me?

I'll never understand how you give your heart to two different people, people
You say you wanna live you life, well that's fine, just break up be single, single
I'll never understand how you give your heart to two different people, people
You say you wanna live you life, well that's fine, just break up be single, single

To be honest I just think...
I'm not sure, it's like guys they
They want the perks of being single and in a relationship at the same time
It just doesn't work like that, you know what I'm sayin?
All I wanna know, how do you cope? what do you do when you
When you have a break up and you single?
I call my bitches and we, we hit the club
That's what I do
