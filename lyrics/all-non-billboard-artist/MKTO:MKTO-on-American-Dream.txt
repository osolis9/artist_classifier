MKTO-on-American-Dream:MKTO
Ooh.
(With your life)

We broke down trying to leave town
Flying down the road to change
We were born to run,
Cali here we come
Escape from nowhere USA

Say goodbye to white picket fences
Say hello to palm trees and Benzes
They say you gotta fall to have it all

Yeah

We don't want two kids and a wife
I don't want a job, I just want a life
Sometimes the underdogs rise and the mighty fall

This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
‘Cause Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So tell me whatever happened to the American Dream

I know a girl I met her last night
She was fresh off the plane
She whispered in my ear,
"Baby, come here. I'll do anything to make a name."

Honey, take my hand follow me
‘cause I don't wanna hurt you but he does
I just wanna give you some real advice

(Listen baby, mmm)

Never take candy from a stranger
And keep your eyes open for danger
‘Cause this right here is the twisted paradise

This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
‘Cause Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So tell me whatever happened to the American Dream

This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
So baby, let's live and die before we're getting old
You know that nothing is the way it used to be
So tell me whatever happened to the American Dream

Na na na...

We were born to run,
Cali here we come
Gettin' out of here, baby
Let's get out of here

This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
‘Cause Jack left Diane thirty years ago
The world is spinning too fast for you and me
So tell me whatever happened to the American Dream

This ain't the same summer song that you used to know
So baby, let's live and die before we're getting old
You know that nothing is the way it used to be
So tell me whatever happened to the American Dream

Na na na.
