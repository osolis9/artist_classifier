(satan): (growl) theres been damage to my kingdom. 
what are we dealing with ?? 
who are they ?? 
see you dealin with a Born Again Believer, a King James reader 
when it come to puttin in work i got more stripes than a zebra 
see the demon murderer in progress 
im grippin the falling star like his name was sirus, 
then i put two up in where he digest 
why stress, i jest, put it down on cise so why kess (??) 
you cant deal with the real, let alone the steal,
let me get this off of my chest 
why yes im just a spiritual cap peela, life killa, blood spilla 
to make it blunt a straight demon killa 
the other day i had a dream, 
it seemed that i was crowned the king, 
given the kingdom and the black queen 
but i told the kingdom bye, and i kissed the queen goodbye 
cuz i'd rather floss up in the ghetto and see demons die 
see i dont have no love for demons and they dont love me 
so i grabs my KJV and i puts it down constantly 
takes authority over the strong man when im 459in him 
he's always on my mind and 
im going to sleep and im dreamin of bindin him 
always a gaze of breakin darkness in a hundred ways 
you check my fault like im on fast and pray a hundred days (??) 
and in yo midst like a guerilla, pleadin the blood over your pillar 
its the Sanctified, Bloodwashed, demon killa, killa 
(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails 
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail 
yea though i walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood 
i fears no evil 
(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails 
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail 
yea though i walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood 
i fears no evil 
im posted outside the gates of Hell, shhh

i hear em talkin, they dont know im stalkin 
the thrill to leave more dead, slugs in they forehead

i kicks in the gate, now its too late 
its no escape, i got the Shield of Faith, 
and im shooting Scriptures like a tray 8 (??) 
a wounded demon pleain, sayin it wasnt him that cursed me 
but i pleads the Blood, "you gets no love", this devil dont get no mercy 
i gave the wicked fools the blues with this Good News 
so tell me what you would've done if you was in my shoes 
i never sweat confrontation, loc, cuz im a kneela 
so how you feel with the real, devil, this is demon killa 


repeat chorus 


young growing up i was never understandin, G 
that it was the devil who broke up my happy family 
had my mom on crack, my daddy on heroine 
now my Bible's my gun, im shootin Scripture like teflon 
see, all my life he had my bound to no good 
till i met a G named Christ had totally put me on your hood 
He said "step into the circle where the Annointing rains hot" 
it made me close my eyes and grab my gut like i was shot 
infillment of the Holy Ghost, loc it was so cool 
aaaaah, time to go to war fool 
its on from now on, im a Christian on a mission 
till they kill me, could they kill me, you dont feel me 
cuz if you did you would get with this, 187 on wickedness 
yes the devils tripping and im stickin this 
Sword of the Spirit down his esophagus 
aint no stoppin us 
demon killa
