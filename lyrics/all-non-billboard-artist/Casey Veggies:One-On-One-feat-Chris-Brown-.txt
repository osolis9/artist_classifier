[Hook - Chris Brown:]
I don't have to leave, so I'm gon' stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you babe, one on one when I love you babe
I ain't worried 'bout shit babe, when I love you
All of your rent paid, when I love you
Give you all of my shit babe, when I love you
No matter where you are, you the shit babe, when I love you

[Verse 1 - Casey Veggies:]
Yeah, I'm just grinding in the spotlight
All these people in our business, yeah it's not right
I'm from where they get the cheque and they cop ice
All them other niggas, swear that's what I'm not like
Got her wet like we fucking in the rain, oh
Going hard, pouring out champagne on her
Shawty flew that pussy straight to me
Steph Curry, long range, though
She said she work for the niggas that treat her right
She made that nigga body bag that shit for life
But for me she 'bout to hop up on a flight
She seeing shit she never seen in her life
Like 10 girls, sex, love, pain, oh
She call me Daddy like it's several first names, no
It's one on one so she climbing up on top of me
No cameras we ain't worried 'bout the fame, no

Half a mill for the deal, let's go
I fuck her so good, she can't keep it on the low
She got ass that was leaning to the floor
And I be riding in that demon down the road
Young nigga pulling up in a new city
I can tell she get around, I ain't stupid
She say she dance, don't think I'm clueless
I'm so fresh, need a girl that's exclusive
The model types get hit, that's easy
One shot, pass her off to C. Breezy
Told her after sleeping on this Live & Grow shit
That's what she told me, the game needs me
She in a bathing suit popping tryna please me
And she bopping like, who are you CV?
A young nigga from the block girl
Always change the spot, I'm a always have a spot, you can't leave me

Must not know me, I can't hit it one time, girl you know I gotta come back
Cause you blow my mind, along with other things, and

Break that body down and do a slow wine just for me cause I
