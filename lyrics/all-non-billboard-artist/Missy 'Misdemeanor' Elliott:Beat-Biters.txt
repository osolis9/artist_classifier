[Missy]
She's ah......uh uh....bitch
Yo...I'ma tell yall straight up and down
It's like this for real, it's goin' down like this foreal
She's ah....bitch (tell 'em)
I'm sick of yall fake Timbaland beat bitin', you know what I'm sayin'
I'ma bring it to yall like this

By all means necessary
You might catch me somewhere stickin' yo baby daddy
They say oh "Missy you wack" but yall not ready 
Cuz I come back like a smack
You hear my gats in yo back (blat-blat-blat)
Huh, like spaghetti
Half of yall MCs be stinkin' like boobetti
So your record label cut you off like confetti
They you wanna call Missy and beg me, (who) ooh beg me beg me
Dag I'm very scary
Burn a whole club down like I was Carrie
Give a boy French kiss, he wanna marry
See yall jealous tricks, yall cannot stand me 
Ooh, that's fine and dandy
Hey daddy-daddy
Why these chickenheads, ooh they be so petty
Hey nah nah nah, you best not test me
I keep tellin' you nah you never ready
Nah you never ready

[CHORUS]
Get rowdy
Let me hear yall loudly
Keep my high niggas 'round me
Let me see yall work it and work it till yall can't stand up
Get rowdy 
Let me hear yall loudly 
Keep my high niggas 'round me 
Let me see yall work it baby, work work it baby WHAT!

[Missy - Verse Two]
In the club, I see niggas 
They think I'm super fly, they blow me sugahs 
so I cut them short like some scissors 
they trying to take me home, they give me liquor 
YOU KNOW WHO I AM, I'ma bitch 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MAKE, filthy rich 
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, gotta gat 
I THOUGHT YOU WAS A FREAK, never that 
You see me on the road, when I stroll 
I float through the toll, like whoa (beep beep)
you just a silly hoe, this I know 
you be at every show, for the dough, hear me now (WHAT)

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Timbaland]
Yo, this is Timbaland
Callin' from the Matrix yall
And this how we do it
Yo Missy, tell 'em how you feel, what

[Missy]
Beat biter, dope style taker, originator 
Or just an imitator 
Stealin' our beats like you're the one who made 'em 
Timbaland's the teacher and I'm the one who grades 'em 
Check the verbatim, F is how we rate 'em 
How dare you make 'em, jus like we made 'em 
And I wont play 'em, and I won't say 'em
Save this for later, so I can tell you straighter

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Missy]
Now see this one right here (ooh)
This is for everybody (ooh) 
This is for my people east (ooh) east, west, south 
East (ooh) west, south (ooh)
But you know what before I get up on outta here (ooh) 
I gotta say one thing to yall beat biters (ooh) 
It's 'bout to be the year 2000 (ooh) you know what I'm sayin'
And I'm kinda sick of that (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
On everything yall gotta come up with 
Yall own creativity, yall own originality, yall own style 
You know what I'm sayin' 
Heh, you gonna be left behind this time 
Aight ain't no love lost 
All  need you to do is stop BEAT BITIN'!

[Timbaland]
That was Missy
Now this is Timbaland signin' off from the Matrix
You heard that
Shh
