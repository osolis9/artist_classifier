Listen-Up:E-Rule
[E-Rule]
Listen up, check it, E-Rule's about to wreck it
? ? in more reverse I got the works when I freak it
Disarm unique wits ? seek it
Diapharetic in the energetic
More than motion draws up kinetic, bein combined with the vibe
Not a man'll transcribe, though they tried
I jot down ? indeed I rock the whole jam
Chumps know the program, identical to no man
When I get busy who is he - my formula rhymes
In parallel lines in perfect, mics to short circuit
Hark, it's worth it - I'm on the brink of blowin up, y'all
Examine hits however they fall with mics in flight
Graphic when I grabs it, gab with forms of this sort
Words I comports with no but's and's or if's
Laid on the reel, eventually the skill'll build
I bag a ? of the ? ism, ill and chill
When I feel I grow like shrubs over dubs indulgin buds
Maybe 4-20 Team hits on the elements of green
What's the word? Travel more than six-third
Brothers in mad words to build upon the scene for the time bein
Dips down to ? God, what's the catch
Knows I can't freak a sketch, got a panoramic view
Plus I'm true, pull no stunts on the crew or you're through
That's a fact, future knack flung by the tongue
Hark to what the God brung, listen up

Flip I'm baggin your click, mark my words - see you never knew
You wouldn't boast at all if you had heard my skills
Secluded in my unit rip rhymes to flow fluent
Manifest my Flatlands style
Be direct from the West I flare form and dare chumps to test
Try and press, I ? the stress, more or less
Marvelous my drifts, I stride boroughs through the fifth
When I shift my zone, got melodic tone
Flows I freak course the mic my resource so let me go on and check
Live and direct, to wreck a technique, I freak mad mad mystique
When I speak, I peak, E-Rule's unique
Fly as well, spark like a ? blastin
Punks are plastic, I'm drastic, ill like Romana
Diggin Afrodonna's in order, no game retain my name
Here it is E-Rule supreme I get biz, you know the scene
That you quote, check what I wrote, recaps responses
No nonsense, here it is in true confound mannerism
Swarms gettin warm due to lingo that I give em
Like that, while you hark to my wis'
Checkin for the sound God and there it is

[E-Rule]
Fresh in the mind to freak thought in writin rhyme
Born and inclined, I'm jukin no chimes, Sign of the no-Times
I make a killin, talkin willin got the feelin
All my skill and functions are modulations as I break trends
Meetin ends with my ? my God sends
Got the format, many swore that, I wouldn't drop
Now I got props, you heard my chumpie, I never slump
See punks are left back, I'm ill like Lefrak, when I kick
My tone slick drifts to fit, manifestin this
Darts thoughts emerge on a hit
You know this foul words you never utter
Cause you know the God's butter
Got my game down pat so my sound's fat
Flow from the end of the pound tracks, rip it then max
I beez aloof to the punks, flowin the gimmicks and acts
I got the formula I'm warnin ya the vibe be mad ill
Expade'in through the feel you're feelin, it's that appealin
Greenbacks I'm reelin, aloof to kids who be stealin
I ? ? not a punk or servile
I'm magnanimous, I grow like canibus, never animous
When I unfold, hope the next man don't plan to bust gold
My form is, after swarm is, enormous the wordin
Of born is, showin em all what gettin warm is - indeed
Harken as I proceed
E-Rule the wise appraise em all
Got a next level song and then I'm gone
