Motor-Car:Gemstone
Watching you rise early
And practice your lines in the dark
Said a man from the Empire had seen your show
Dropped off an invitation
So I could go

Ooh she's got a groovy little, sexy little motor car
She's riding 'round town, you know
Looking like a movie star
Waiting by the phone
Wishing she'd return to me
But peolple are blinded by the flashbulbs
And getting in for free

You practice your autograph
Stop using your real name
First class, roses and champange
Counting the numbers to see how you'll grow

Ooh she's got a groovy little, sexy little motor car
She's riding 'round town, you know
Looking like a movie star
Waiting by the phone
Wishing she'd return to me
But people are blinded by the flashbulbs
And getting in for free

Returned my books to the house
Got a thank you card for the help
Not seen you in quite a while
My old dear mate
Missed the tickets,
So it looks like I'm in for a wait

Ooh she's got a groovy little, sexy little motor car
She's riding 'round town, you know
Looking like a movie star
Waiting by the phone
Wishing she'd return to me
But the people get blinded by the flashbulbs
And gettin in for free
