No-Can-Compare:Amil
You show me love
You got my back, yeah
You always here
No one could compare, nigga

[Incomprehensible], my nigga for life, what?

Remember when we met like a year ago?
When I was milkin' out trix like cereal
Fuck a Chon Don Nectar Imperial
Treat me right, I'll show you wifey material

Never would of thought we'd get down like this
Said you never been this happy 'til you found this bitch
At the Ritz countin' stacks like pounds was flipped
In the mornin' go shoppin', let me bounce the 6

Get a kiss on the lips when I'm around your clique
Get the feelin' one day you'll be crownin' this
You inspire me to lace all the nouns I spit
Compared to you them other cats don't amount to shit

Always kept it wet like Bangladesh
Turned me out like mesh when you spank the flesh
Got me rotten, trickin' 50 percent an' bank the rest
Your name chipped out on my tennis anklet

You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare

You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare

Ain't no nigga like the one I got, my nigga
An' that's from the heart, my nigga
'Coz you brought me from the slums to the top, my nigga
Show these bitches what you got done to my watch, my nigga

Ain't a millionaire who could take your place
Got me screamin' out your name when we shake an' bake
Got my ass kinda fat of the Jamaican plates
Who dat on the other line, nigga? Make 'em wait

Everybody told me don't fuck wit you
But despite all the rumors, I'm in love with you
Nothin's ever too little or too much for you
If you ever leave, I wouldn't know what to do

Shit, you for me, open like the bank accounts
Started screenin' calls, stopped hangin' out
Everythin' about you got me blankin' out
You keep satisfied plus Franklyned out

You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare

You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare

You think you was the first to ever make me nut
Be callin' you Daddy like you raised me up
Maybe one day we'll have a lil' baby us
Growin' up listenin' to Jay-Z stuff

'Coz what we are is a perfect combo
We done come too far to let this go
It ain't about your car or about your dough
You ain't gotta be a star to be in my show

When my man needs me, I run to it
When my man calls, I jump to it
Give up everythin' if it come to it
Got a ring on my left hand with lumps through it

You my best friend, confidante, other hand
Up in the bubble bath, makin' each other laugh
I doubt if I could ever give anotha the ass
Y'all mad 'coz this ain't what most lovers have

You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare

You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare

You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare

You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare
