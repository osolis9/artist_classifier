Da-Bomb-Extended-Version-:Inner Circle
Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more
Girl you hit me with the bomb
Then you said so long
You don't wanna play no more

You wanna step to this
Come on and step right up
You wanna test my faith
Cause you ain't got enough
You took my kindness
For weakness
My weakness for
Your sweatness
It's all about the things you do

The gal step to my face and dis the move
Boon boon she just dis the groove
She gi me loving so she de pon mi mind
Up town down town still can't find
Like wee willy winkle I'm running thru the town
Upstairs downstairs round and round
Knocking on ya window
Baby come back so take it
From the top and give me lovin non stop

You like to play around
Messing with my mind
I fight to keep my sanity
The word is out on the street
And everyone you meet
They tell of all the things you do
