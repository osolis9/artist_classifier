Yo, what up girl

or sumthin'
Uh
One kiss and I had you hooked
Got you callin' me every day and night
One touch and I had you sNow your tellin' all your girls that I do it right
Told me that I was the first
That ever made you wanna do the things you do
First one who ever put it down
First one who ever made you say
Ooooh, I love it when you make me go, Ooooh
'Cause then you wanna gimmie some, Ooooh
All because I made you go, Ooooh, Ooooh
Ooooh, I love it when I make you go, Ooooh
'Cause then you wanna gimmie some, Oooh
All because I made you go, Ooooh, Ooooh
Your body all over me
Got me up against the wall to your favourite song
All night and I cant believe
That you can keep it goin 'til the early morn'
Whatever you want from me
Its yours all because of how you make me feel
Ain't nothing that I wouldnt do

All because you always make me go
Tell me the way you like it, fast or slow
I know the way to make you lose control
Won't take advantage, baby, of your love
Just wanna make sure that you get enough
What, why you (??) girl
Okay, I get it.
