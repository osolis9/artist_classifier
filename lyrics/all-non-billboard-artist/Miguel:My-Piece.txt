Need to seize and desist
That's why I keep you equipped

I, I, I, I got a firearm fetish
Fascination, infatuation
Yeah, for my haters
Raise a temp. give them fever

How I wish I could hold
I could squeeze her
We make them reach for the sky
Laugh, make them cry

Believe till I die
So they can test our trust
But they'll never get the best of us
Bet, that
