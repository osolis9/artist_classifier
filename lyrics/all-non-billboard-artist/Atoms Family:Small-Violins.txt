Small-Violins:Atoms Family
(Intro:)
You know what's this? It's the world's smallest violin

(Verse 1: Alaska)
It's like this when my mic hits your scalp like nightsticks
And mites bit so I can turn on the light switch
Do you mind with my rhyme shit?
Create a climate that's timeless and climb cliffs
Obstacles become goals
Thanks to impossible flows
The ranks are my apostles who grow
Why you posture for gold?
You perpetrate for platinum
Serve the fake for satisfaction
Resurrect
For respect
With my mic check
Don't write checks my ass can't cash
If hip hop's dead then I'm a necrophiliac
Digging out backs and feeling tracks when I rack
Full Metal Jacket rapid tacks
Stanley Kubrick with two clicks for faggots on some bullshit
My twenty-one gun salute says, "fuck you"
Have you fools swinging from your neck like truck jewels
I play the background
My rap sounds lay the smackdown on you whack clowns
With pen hits
Blending with tremendous
Vengeance, sentence, weapons
Implemented with aggression
Just to teach a lesson
That Alaska's a bastard
Whose genetic patterns spelled backwards spells disaster for the masses

(Kasm:)
It takes forty seconds to percolate my sensation
Reduce the census mention
In the state I meant to mingle
Case and passions are a bliss
Special shripulation
Split if the issues react
Thought the boy inverted
Up you, Mr. Wizard, tissue paper
Situated
Systematic
Pistol-packing
Crystal-cracking
Mental-lacking
False picture painting
Second going on third generation imitation
Soon enough, it'll be disintegrated
With the syntom crates
Hand golf, milk carton, missing children
Kissing buildings
Listen pilgrim
Let's bark
Plenty fill
In the dark
Many will
Trends start
And they will
And it kills my ears
When I listen to them
I'm dissin' fluid
All you want to be
Mr. Glue, principal
Simon spend, swing now
Surreal
Cerebral
It's not for real
It's just surreal
Furina
Curiosity drilled the life into the black cat
Purina
Shake 108-9877
Sit dependent round the shriff
Like pensive spaces, arenas
The air of the addict
Dust particles
Bust colorful
Plus parts tickle touch mark spickle emcees
Lose darts, single pop
Ice pickle shelf
Nice and dark
Knock on nocturnal lark
I be touch shark bite, sharp light, ginsu, pen you, swim through, menu, men knew me
Past life, bliss, god, this pride
I blast off
Like alien tongues, no failure is spun, I listen to the songs of whales when I'm done
And sail to the sun (sail to the sun, sail to the sun)

(Chorus:)
This environments, the violets
And fighting violence
Small violins playin' sad songs
Tryin' kids
Every closed eyelid ain't sleepin'
Every man ain't even
Some of us are odd
Some of us think we're god
Some are lost in the fog
We refuse to be a cog
In the machine killin' man
Atoms fam
Sabotage without a plan
When the oven gets too hot
We jump back in the fryin' pan

(Verse 2: Windnbreeze)
Upon ingestion of this rhyme
Your mind'll lose it's focus
Ostics kaleidoscopic
And the lights flash strobic
Close, tight rhymes
Cause minds to feel claustrophobic
As we walk the fine line between emcee kind and spoken poets
And most hold it between their molar and incisor
And I thrust my head in disgust
But some use their heads and discuss
These rhymers, and utilize the rhyme as fertilizer
"what's this the bomb? "
Shit, I'm the timer
Mission: slowly ticking, never repetitive
Slowly approaching close to u negative
You, negatives
Location of u zeros is my destination
Not for prolonged stays, but to ignite the rhyming detonation
Listen, my position's parallel to time
I can't be stopped, slowed, contained, or explained when I rhyme
So accept it that I'm the exception to the rule
And I rule, so accept it, fool
A dispersal of your molecules is imminent
Beware the quotes of intelligence
That float with the elegance of flights of pelicans
And I'll be brief, tight
Mental boxing and a fight
Where?
In the underwood, body blows
Lefts and rights
Your glass jaw shattered beyond mending
The timer reverses towards ten, now slowly ascending

(Cryptic One:)
Swift like the golden leopard
And I'm stabbing westward
Thawing breath down my chest
So I'm under pressure
Through the passin' it in gift
My gems, well treasured
To those who diss it
I'm the standard to which they measure
You can never get
With the proper etiquette
Spittin' out rhetoric
With incomplete measurements
Your whole style, I prefaced it
I better than replenished the jazz
Intent to step on stage, with your lyrical deficit
Your incongruence was my best defense
Raw toward geographies, all my natural residents
Many righteous men have labeled me heaven sent
My evidence is how I represent, on a constant
True it's been said that you're one of the illest yet
But how you gonna shine, when you're standing in chasm's silhouette

(Chorus:)
This environments, the violets
And fighting violence
Small violins playin' sad songs
Tryin' kids
Every closed eyelid ain't sleepin'
Every man ain't even
Some of us are odd
Some of us think we're god
Some are lost in the fog
We refuse to be a cog
In the machine killin' man
Atoms fam
Sabotage without a plan
When the oven gets too hot
We jump back in the fryin' pan

And I ain't lyin' man...
