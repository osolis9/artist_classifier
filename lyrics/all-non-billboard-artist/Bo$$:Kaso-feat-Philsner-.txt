A lot of drinks in here, but these chicks don't know how to do it how I want it

[Verse 1 - B.O]

They say they love it how I do it
Looking at the top I'mma get right to it
Yeah you know who gonn rock Busy B gonn do it
I'mma send a couple 'a shots if a nigga act foolish 

No trips over here
Tell the bar tender bring the drinks over hear
All these niggas gonn hate more chicks over
I'mma pop a couple 'a bottles with the team nigga we don't care 

Look at me ma nigga 
Dealing with a King can't you see ma nigga
Wen'ushota nge String yous a G ma nigga
I'mma give her that thing coz she sweet ma nigga

No beef where I'm from
Got a lot of lip? you get hit where I'm from
We gonn treat you like a blunt you get lit where I'm from
You go 6 fit deep if you trip where I'm from.

[Chorus] 

A lot of chicks in here, busy looking at me like a nigga gonn run it
A lot of drinks in here, but these chicks don't know how to do it how I want it

Ngifuna oyenza Kaso (Kanjan)
Turn around bese wenza Kaso 
Ngifuna oyenza Kaso (Kanjan)
Turn around bese wenza Kaso...
