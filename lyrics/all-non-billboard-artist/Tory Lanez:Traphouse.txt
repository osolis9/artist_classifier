Traphouse:Tory Lanez
Shawty you know that a nigga won't lie
Came into my house, I had to bust it like a whole pie
I know she the bomb, she hit bong like a smoka
She passed me that white, I said "I don't do no coca"
Fuck up out my trap house, my trap house, that's no lie
Kick you out my trap house, my trap house that's no lie
Hop inside that foreign whip on Ocean, hit the whole drive
I would say you balling but I see you in that O-5
I pull couple bands from that stash, she get more fire
Hard to see these other niggas in here, they in Lo-Fi
Shawty, I'm the man, I'm the man and I won't lie
Don't come to my crib if you ain't fucking
Shawty, that's that shit I don't like
Open up my IG, bitches telling more lies
See them out in real life, niggas don't get no gwuap
Pop a couple bands though, uno, dos and four knots
Fuck up off of my dick, no bitch, you my hoe job
