Thank-You:Cam Meekins
I'm waking up
Living in a new day
I'm shaking up
Off the dome like a toupee
Grind the weed
Put it in the paper
You're finding me, fuck that see you later
Fuck the stress I'm just doing my best
Smoking some sess
Never passing a test
So fucking blessed
I'm, getting dressed in some fly new gear
Homies waving hi its a brand new year yup
Gotta couple shows locked in, cop them
Tickets if you wanna seem me pop lock drop then
I'm a hit maker
While you're a shit taker
I'm with your girl
And she's pretty much a dick taker
Ha, never stop, never drop homie
I'm drop top with the cop smell a grop homie
But I don't ever care
This life is Everclear
I'm looking down on you haters in my second year

To all the ladies that I had in the past won't last
Its a new year
I'll be going fast
Look back, look at all the things I've done
But you be tripping if you think I won
To all the ladies I had in the past won't last
Its a new year
I'll be going fast
Look back, look at all the things I've done
But you be tripping if you think I won
Because I still got a way to go

And if you miss me I'm here making history
Poetic you bitches couldn't even really diss me
They couldn't get me
Fast like a Bentley
Luxury class no tax riding jet skis
And getting fucked up scarred on my waist
I'll be trying to get my bucks up
Large into place
Damn, I'm a kid
Be your own dude
Never listening because I play my own rules
And I know my poems rule
But dude I can't lose
You gots to find you
Get hot like Cancun
I'm on another level
I'm gone and never settle
You wrong if you ain't hitting the bong
And getting medals, dog
Yeah, I gots to keep it real
I love all music
I never fucking steal
I gots to make a mill
Take cocky shots for will
Let you know that I'm the best
I dont even have a deal

To all the ladies that I had in the past won't last
Its a new year
I'll be going fast
Look back, look at all the things I've done
But you be tripping if you think I won
To all the ladies I had in the past won't last
Its a new year
I'll be going fast
Look back, look at all the things I've done
But you be tripping if you think I won
Because I still got a way to go

We got a long way to go man, but yo, I wanna say thank you to a couple people...
