{Cham}

Coming round the block once again with my jam
ride,
Cham is the man with love for the brown thighs
and the but
stuffed, round brother
on me baby,
but you know you can't fade me
on my crew
the infinite mass late night creepin
under skirts we peepin'
so whatcha gonna do
(whatcha gonna do)
nothing
(nada)
comprende
I know you like it so
why fight it
hellatight
my clique is rolling big time
in lack of no beer
we don't care about'em anytime
anywhere
with the windows down
and their hands in the air
screaming party over here
(everwhere)
Playa hatas around the world
you better take us if not get currated in curls
coz my clique don't give a hoooo
front back side to side that's my clique and me gonna

**Chorus**
Ride, and slide in my G-Ride
All you freaks out there
C'mon 'n
Ride 'n slide in my G-Ride
all you freaks out there

{Rod-i}

Ahh yeah,
right front seat open
hands on the wheel 4n
locks on the feelin'
coz I got it goin' it's on
open the new mass ride song
g-ride' n slide 'n my ride
and hoochies better warn it high
or get a shot on bump'n'grind
(bump'n'grind)
drink red wine, glad to be alive
bulla bulla bullet to the minute I die
coz where I'm from
the players keep playin'
the players ain't payin'
let your momma sing what she's sayin'
Cham keep 'em on
(day on)
coz today it's an all night bone
turn the pager off
and kill the cellular
roll through the city and forget about the regular
is'nit
and hook the fine digits up
coz tonight's the night
yo! you know what's up

**Chorus**
Ride, an' slide in my G-Ride
All you freaks out there
Come'on an'
Ride 'n slide in my G-Ride
all you freaks out there

{Bechir}

Mobin' through the city
on a creep tip
loco thylin'
and straight stylin'
no raggin' and riding
sit up bow ow
(ow)
yellow with the tenned windows
with the pimp and gangsta tell'n ya
I got 5 on the sac but I ain't touchin' that, D
only look up for the babes on the streets
I know they couldn't see coz
pump the beast
I ain't no mob but they know that
still jumpin' right of get ah
ladies wanna do the hoochie coo
but the hoochie coo ain't no for me and you
coz I'm a man and use a piece of me
don't have a B but you come real cheap
Bechir is the name
got fame of the game
the hood cat black
now suck on that
now I'ma ride
Ride
