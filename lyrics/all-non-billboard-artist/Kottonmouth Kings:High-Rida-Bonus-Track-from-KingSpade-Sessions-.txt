(High Riiiiidaz)

We the, High Ridaz
Holdin' mad green
Got our pockets and pipes filled
You know what I mean?
You know the High Ridaz
D-Loc and Johnny Rich
Step in any session
And we'll end it quick
Who's a High Rida?
Who's down with a squad?
Who's down to smoke an ounce
And go chill at the bar
If you a High Rida
Throw'em up real high
Put your drinks in the air
And your joints in the sky

Back in the day
When I was young growin up
I always toke buds
And I never gave a fuck
Rode around in a bug
Always had my pants saggin
Sold a little weed
And had a spray can for taggin
But nowadayz I changed
I rearranged my whole scene
I made a little cash
And bought a house for my green
I still sag my pants
And smoke alot more weed
I stopped taggin
Shhhhh, you know what I mean?
We the High Ridaz
Always down to smoke
My homie Johnny Richter
And the motherfuckin D-Loc
We ain't no joke
We be blazin' up the weed
Dazin people in the industry
Blazin up the scene
Kingspade, thats the brand new clique
D-Loc and Johnny Richter
On some real ill shit
We ain't fakin
So fuck fakers and liars
Fuck every hater
Cause we the High Ridaz

I'll take you back in the days
When I was just a young scrub
Growin up in the game
Of slanging bud
Rollin around my town
Udalizin back streeets
Cause I always had a pound
In my back seeeats
See I'ma High Rida
Since about '92
I got my start
Buyin Q's off this dude named Lou
Now I'm slangin lyrically
Puttin joints on beat
Smokin stages like
I'm smokin on a Hindu spliff
Cruisin up on down your blocks
We got the shot on lock
D-Loc and Johnny Richter
We on fire, we hott
Watchin jaw drops
As soon as we step into the room
We causin quakes, fuck
We hittin with you sonic booms!
My tomb will say
He went out in a blaze
Packin bowls
Of green crack and purple haze
Cause in my last days
I'ma gon' be stoned as fuck
Drunk as a skunk
Gettin head from your girl
Wassup!?
