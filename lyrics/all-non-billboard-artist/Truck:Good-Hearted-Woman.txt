Good-Hearted-Woman:Truck
A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.
