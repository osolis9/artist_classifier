Night-Of-The-Long-Knife:Bronze Nazareth
[** Vol. 2:]
[** feat. 5-Star:]


[5-Star:]
Life in these streets is ill, so I embrace steel*
Verbal scientist that sweep many battlefields
Brilliant like the mind of scholars, we seek dollars
Defender of human rights, I move with solar power
Son of the Universe, cursed by pagan smoke
Wimbledon grass while I hunt for the assailant
Black masked ninja typed thief inside the castle
World game of death scale the Tower of Babble
I travel in the form of a storm or a bee swarm
Dirty butcher knife slit your neck then I'm gone
It's the Night of the Long Knives, I rise from the wreckage
Bronze hooked the beat, make sure the mic's connected
Selected by high priest, to murder the beef
The ultimate goal of war is to bring peace
The Celsius increased to code red levels
5-Star the Avenger chop the head of the Devil
Then lounge with the angels, celestial portrait
The force that I carry keep the planets in orbit
Mash with the Bronzeman through the swamp lands
Where niggas is cracked out and the corners is blacked out
