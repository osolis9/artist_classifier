The-Realest:White Boy
[Verse1] (MrZeeFosho)
Yeah, yeah.. Look..
Looking at the mirror, I love the reflection
So I really got no reason for stressing
Their dream was to see me suffering
Well that so called dream is fucking faded
Z double E, just bought a brain fertelizer
Now my mind is cultivated
I'll never stop, this walk has no final destination
Special thanks to my enemies
You been nothing but a motivation
All this hate be my levitation
Real ni55as I got those
Fake bitches I dumped those
Sexy beautiful girls I got lotta those
Fake ni55as I got non o'those

You don't love me, then it's a fuck fuck
Fuck y'all hating, my shit top-notch

Man I kill ni55as, I'm a bad boy
Killing every ni55a I don't even feel a shame
Ni55as on some old shit
PS4 is out I'm about to change this game
Z double E, Z double E, Z double E
Killing every ni55a be talking
Bullshit in front of me
I be with em bitches who talk about bicthes
When they feel like bictches
Ohh Lord forgive em bitches
Numbers don't lie I keep it OneHundred
Man I'm dope and I don't even practice
They say practice makes perfect,
Shit's a different story when you perfect
And you never practice
