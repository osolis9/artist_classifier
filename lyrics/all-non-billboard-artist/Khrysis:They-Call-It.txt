They-Call-It:Khrysis
[Intro]
Do ya got it? I said I need it
Da ya have it? Cause I want it
Do ya got it? Cause I want it
Cause I need it
It's love

[Verse 1]
I can look in her eyes, she looking for love
It's a hell of a high, what a beautiful drug
Make you feel you can fly, can't leave it alone
Spending nights at the club but she leaving alone
Every week is the same, guys running the game
Can I buy you a drink? Girl, what is your name?
All you really wanting is somebody who want you
Got you doing all the things you normally don't do
Got a plan escape, saying who could I run to
When she coming home with no one to come home to
Someone to support you, who never divorce you
Every queen need a king, don't let the jokers court you
Girl, live and you learn, some bridges get burned
Some things remain, some tables get turned
Stead of looking for signs gotta make up your mind
May not come when you want, love comes when it's time
It's that real

[Hook]
Do ya need it? Do ya got it?
Can I get it? Cause I want it
I think they call it (love), I think they call it (love)
I think they call it (love), I think they call it (love)

[Verse 2]
Do you know what it like when the love of your life
No longer your love, no longer your wife
Feeling empty inside like the place where you live
She got a new man, she taking the kids
Judge tell you the time see your daughter or son
A couple weekends a month, as if that shit is enough
And then you hustling hard, man who woulda thought
Falling in love would have you falling apart
But right then it hit you, right around Christmas
Someone else face on your family picture
Damn, he got the life that you always wanted
It's gonna be a long night and even longer morning
But you only see the sun if you can weather the storm
Nothing lasts, everything will be eventually gone
Now I guess he see what all the struggle was for
Cause when he picked up his kids, they run straight to his arms
Now that's love
