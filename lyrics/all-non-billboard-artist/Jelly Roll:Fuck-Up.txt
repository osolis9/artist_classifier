Fuck-Up:Jelly Roll
Cause I've been a fuck up my whole damn life
There ain't too many things that I've done right
And maybe one day I settle and gonna get a wife
But until then I'm just livin' my life
Yes I'm just a fuck up, yes I'm just a fuck up x2
I've fucked up
Real deal thoroughbred used to have a life of crime
Graduated now they pay your boy just to write a rhyme
My best isn't enough so I tend to not give a fuck
Only got one life to live and I reckon - I live it up
And I'm a dog, griding to keep me on the leash
Listen y'all, inside it's all lies and little peace
With world full of band these different kind of people
I guess it's sad to say, there's a necessary evils
This girl is in my ear and she's begging me just to leave
All the sudden my ability to think is leaving me
And I know I'm fucked up and I know I ain't livin' right
But tell the truth y'all, I may never get it right

Cause I've been a fuck up my whole damn life
There ain't too many things that I've done right
And maybe one day I settle and gonna get a wife
But until then I'm just livin' my life
Yes I'm just a fuck up, yes I'm just a fuck up x2
I've fucked up

It's only homies callin' me, man I swear they like to talk
Treat 'em like me texts now, all I do is write 'em up
Finally got a going man, I finally got a budget
But with the [?] my attitude was not working
So I'm drunk all out in public, stumblin' in oversteps
It's ten in the morning and I ain't been to sleep yet
And I'm still drinking, I got a meeting right around noon
Walking in with shoey and I'm high as a baloon
Woah, I can't believe it I get paid to write songs
I've been never wrong/right but I've been right/wrong
Take me out in public, I'll embarrass your ass
I'm a real deal piece of american trash

Cause I've been a fuck up my whole damn life
There ain't too many things that I've done right
And maybe one day I settle and gonna get a wife
But until then I'm just livin' my life
Yes I'm just a fuck up, yes I'm just a fuck up x2
I've fucked up

Dark rooms and long nights, them really long nights
We've been doing wrong things lately but it's alright
Grew around the sinners that just really want to win
So everytime I get a chance, fuck I'm going in
There's no need to pretend, fuck it let's go again
Refuse to leave a conversation with an open in
I've never been a bully, I bully bullies in back
My mind's got a frame that isn't fully in tact
Forgive me how I talk, I might come up progressive
But just speak direct when you speak in my direction
I don't wanna talk circles to pretend to be friends
I'm any day away from jumpin' off the deep end
And meanwhile my career, they say it's blowin' up
Everytime I drop a track, now them people going nuts
Meanwhile this life is can of worms and it just opened up
Finally get rid of all the fucks that tried to hold me up
I got a publicist now, man I've been lovin' it
But I don't think she really knows with who she's fuckin' with
Cause I when I get fucking rich, I bet I'm gon' fuck up shit
Get on interviews and I bet I say the dumbest shit
Bet the record label hates everyone I'm runnin' with
I'mma blow wall for bunch of money for the fuck of it
Hey, look I needed this, sometimes I just need to bent
This is therapeutic music, every verse are we on it

Cause I've been a fuck up my whole damn life
There ain't too many things that I've done right
And maybe one day I settle and gonna get a wife
But until then I'm just livin' my life
Yes I'm just a fuck up, yes I'm just a fuck up x2
I've fucked up
