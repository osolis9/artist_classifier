Orca:Until the Ribbon Breaks
I don't know, could go to 7th street
In the spring we moved out west
I missed the cocktails at the Concorde
But every wave must have a crest
There is an image that I-I cannot shake
The wind blowing through your hair
A part of you still moving, but all of you are not there
I wonder how they think of you now
Which picture they've had framed
And if its easier at dinner to not bring up your name

Orca, Orca, Orca
There's nothing quite as black and white as you

Of course there are two oceans
The shadow and the truth
The one outside your window, and the one inside of you
So change your hand [?]
But [?] to see the truth
I think I knew that you were dying
I just didn't want the proof

Orca, Orca, Orca
There's nothing quite as black and white as you

You were dressed in your shirt
With your back to the wall
Like you made up your mind
Like you knew

We all make our own way
Into blue
We all make our own way
Into blue
Theres nothing quite, as black and white, as you
I wonder if you feel it too
Theres nothing quite, as black and white, as you
We all make our own way into blue
Orca, orca, orca, orca

You were dressed in your shirt
With your back to the wall
Like you made up your mind
Like you knew

We all make our own way
Into blue
We all make our own way
Into blue
We all make our own way
Into blue
We all make our own way
Into blue
