People-Business:Lady Saw
And as I say I don't wanna know about you your fans or what
They have what they did last week last night or whenever
It's not my business you know I got my own business
And mi nuh waan know nuttin bout nobody business because
As soon as mi seh, unno guh out there guh seh weh mi nuh seh
Mi nuh waan nobody mix mi up unno hear weh mi seh

People business is not my own, that's why marianne par alone

Deh ah blow saxophone, mi nuh care 'bout freaky kimone and
Nuh care about belinda who always a roam, latisha she accident
Prone, suh tell ah dutty gal seh come off ah mi phone

Nuh need fi nuh confrontation, yow you know mi nah haffi speak
To ah gal, mi ah gal send mi peeps to ah gal, ah gal talk
Bottle beat to ah gal, call out mi name then mi reach to ah gal
And seh
