Remember-the-Time:Mack Wilds
Do you remember
When we fell in love
We were young
And innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?

Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Back in the fall (I bet you remember)
We'd be together (I bet you remember)
All day long (I bet you remember)
Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Us holding hands (I bet you remember)
In each other's eyes (I bet you remember)
We'd stare (I bet you remember)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk
We'd stay on the phone
At night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so
I'll never let you go

Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Back in the spring (I bet you remember)
Every morning birds would sing (I bet you remember)
Do you remember (I bet you remember)
Those special times (I bet you remember)
They'll just go on and on (I bet you remember)
In the back of my mind (I bet you remember)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was we said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
