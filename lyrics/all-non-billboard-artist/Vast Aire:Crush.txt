Crush:Vast Aire
This is not a love song. Naa.

[Verse 1:]
I had a crush on Tawanda she went to IS230
Figure eight she was so curvy
Had an arch in her back with mad jewelery
Every Neanderthal wanted that cutie
Good complexion not too thin
She got the baddest trim
I ain't talking about her hair cut
She worked at my man's job
She made 11th grader's wanna cradle rob
She got the sweet potato, I got the corn on the cob
Tuck your shirt in she don't take no slobs
If you saw her smile, she had a bad attitude and a wicked profile
Gorgeous face and a nice style, it make you say "Damn you can have my child"
Got me thinking all this is worth my while
With my head in the clouds screaming loud

[Chorus:]
I got a love Jones, for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
So you can sit by the throne (2x)

[Verse 2:]
She looked good in the winter, better in the summer
I met her at the bus stop, she gave me her number
Sometimes we would go out and then slumber
She me yours, I'll show you mine (She lift up her sweater)
Back then no girl could do better
I really dug Karen, or was it Annetta
Or was it Vanessa, Stacey or Tracie
I didn't like Jessica, she was too spacey
Mia's got attitude, Janice got her tittie out
Missy's gay, Via's got her ass out
But Melissa's on the bed drinking wine
Don't hate on me Pa, I got pimp designs

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Pink cookies in a plastic bag getting crushed by the empire states
Come on baby why wait
Let's make whoopee today
I'm a Frankenstein valentine (how's that)
Caus I can separate my heart from my mind
You were to emotional and then about 3 seconds I'm about to go postal
In other words, crazy nigga with a gun
I got a crush on you but you ain't the one
She was using sex as a weapon
Her aim was precise it kept me guessing
It kept me stepping
I was on my toes until I learnt my lesson
My man tried to tell me I was slippin (slippin man)
I ain't even no I was trippin
But this is not a love song
Well, maybe it is
Maybe I'm frontin
Why don't you pull my card
If the deuce is wild, I'll let down my guard

[Repeat Chorus:]
