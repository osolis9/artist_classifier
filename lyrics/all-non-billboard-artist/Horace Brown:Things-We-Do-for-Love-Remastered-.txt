Things-We-Do-for-Love-Remastered-:Horace Brown
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH!! YEAH!!

Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love

Romantic places in my mind
Hoping someday I would find
The perfect one
And I could share
And then the day you walked inside
And no longer could I hide
My love, I had to take you there
Sailing on a cruise at night "Sailing on a cruise at night!"
Gazing to the ocean under moonlight "Yeaahh Yeahh!"
Taking you to paradise "Paradise baby"
OOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH!! YEAH!!

I showered you with gifts of love
But it was never enough
To bring; you closer to me
Tricking money was no thing
The simple pleasure that you bring
My way; takes me back to the day
We were. sailing on a cruise at night
"Sailing on a cruise at night!"
Gazing to the ocean under moonlight "Under moonlight"
Taking you to paradise, taking you to paradise
Awwwwwwhhhh, YEAH!! YEAH!!

The things we do for love!!
YEAH!! YEAH!!
The things we do for love!!
Awwwww AHHHHHH!!!
OOOOHHHHHHHH YEEEAHHHH!!
The things we do for love!!
Montego Bay!!
