Mowf Of Madness (the Sequel)
[female singing]
Supafriendz is a crew that you must fear
So mc's get concerned
Cause every time they grab the mic
Mc's will get burned
But they're here to represent, you see
With more funky joints like these
They kick some lines and some phat rhymes
To take out wack mc's (because!)

Every time mad skillz and danja mowf combine, mc's lose they minds
(one time) yes my crew be the baddest
(two times) come and enter the mowf of madness

Hold up, while i give my soul up to get some platinum and gold up
On my wall and to control the
Music that i make and how it's sold but
Knowing if i blowed up the underground would treat me colder
Than they supposed to, really makes me want to fold up
My rap book and say "it's over," plus i'm getting older
And making art doesn't hold up in the industry
That wants they pockets swoll up, so puff's got it sewed up
And if i switch remember that i told y'all
Cause staying true to underground goals ain't something that i owed ya
Cause if i don't make hits, i'm gone
Cause no hits mean i don't make no money so i'm gone
But if i make a hit to the underground i'm gone
So if i'm signed or i'm unsigned still in time i'm gone
So when i step the hell off, why not be living well off
No matter how i play y'all still gonna say i fell off

The results of me in a mc blackout
Attitudes get caught so you either whipping the mic or the mac out
Instead of writing y'all cats chose to take the slack route
Either place you act out and we can have a smack out
Rappers think they leading, i'm soon to get 'em
Apply pressure to mc's just by sitting in the room with 'em
Every rapper is my enemy
And i don't even speak no more unless there's a beat in my vicinity
Huh, i grab mics for the glory
And run with two tight-ass dykes that smack the hell out of a rapper for me
Crush niggas, drop at the bus niggas
Shut your top lip, prophecy, and hush niggas
I touch mc's and leave 'em wishing
I have shoulders shifting like your ass was in a cabbage patch competition
After you lose to mad skillz it's on
Take your face/off like nick cage and dip it in chrome, so what's up?

(one time) yes my crew be the baddest
(two times) come and enter the mowf of madness (repeat 2x)

All these record labels is jive
Ichiban ain't the one, i break big beats down to size
And crush 'em like american red ants in france
By the thousand, and get a penalty for ruffhousin'
Now my wild profile is known east west and universal
Virgins on mercury know i hurt you
I told the warner brothers that they'll get smacked loud in laface
On payday, i eat a rapper a-day
With defjam on 'em, my priority never switches
Your unit got no flavor cause your vinyl ain't delicious
Which is the reason we have planned it
Electrocute you all and throw you into the atlantic, what?

[mad skillz]
Yo, f a beat, cause i'm a rhyme to the crack of your bones
I got you singing like mariah, you changing tone
Over here mc's get no wins
Cause mad skillz is not the one, identical twins
Personality split with perfect timing, and my sould could leave my body
And whip your ass while i'm rhyming
You facing the unmasked jason
If i kept you with a pen and a pad, you'd better have a job application

Every time mad skillz and danja mowf combine, mc's lose they minds
