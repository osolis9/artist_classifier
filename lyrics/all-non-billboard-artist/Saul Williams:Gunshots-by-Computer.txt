Gunshots-by-Computer:Saul Williams
are you looking for the truth or for another fight?
if you want to give me what i want then give it up tonight
freedom
ain't looking for no, ain't looking for no fight
if you want to give me what i want then give it up tonight

the world that circles around me can benefit from silence
this song is my enemy, watch how i become it
cradled by mystery and make believe i am floating in the other night
children wish upon me

this man and his army are praying in their fortresses making guns of steeples
insurgents of people
through messiahs
an immigrant detained at the border
severed from his trinity, his wife, and his daughter

america the beautiful, not beheaded hold down
lynchburg throwdown
it seems our favorite past-time has become our most feared future
technology has failed us

gunshots by computer

are you looking for the truth or for another fight?
if you want to give me what i want then give it up tonight
freedom
ain't looking for no, ain't looking for no fight
if you want to give me what i want then give it up tonight
