Man I'm so broke it ain't a joke
Some people got rims I got spokes
I'm working with change they got notes
And I don't know how much longer I can cope

I'm about to fall over the edge
I'm in deep way over my head
When I get ten pounds, I make it spread
'Cuz that gyro check ain't hardly no bread

When your broke like us you don't joke much
Only window shop, look don't touch
Ask the price of stuff then say how much
Nah, wait there how much?

How long would you last without no cash
In this fast moving world?
Could you really survive
All the problems within?

Better get moving if you want that
Bread is there for the taking better get your share
Monies for making, what I'm saying
If you're sleeping, you ain't eating
How you goin' to cope if you don't stack those notes
You need to learn to be a pioneer
You can find a way to make it through the day

Another day, another red letter
From some debt collector
Over something I've done, got in debt for
Coming over my house to apply the pressure
Yelling through the letter box
â€½One day we gonna getcha!â€

Acting like I ain't home till they're gone
Everybody I know's broke, I can't get a loan
I'm trying not to loose focus buts it's hopeless
I get served an eviction notice

And the landlord wants me out on my ear
Gave me ten days to pay or I'm outta here
I really need to clear up my arrears
Before I end up, sleeping in a park somewhere

How long would you last without no cash
In this fast moving world?
Could you really survive
All the problems within?

Better get moving if you want that
Bread is there for the taking better get your share
Monies for making, what I'm saying
If you're sleeping you ain't eating
How you goin' to cope if you don't stack those notes
You need to learn to be a pioneer
You can find a way to make it through the day

I know suffering I fell your pain
It's hard to keep the cheddar coming in
Wanna survive, then you've gotta stay hustling?
Struggling chasing the doe
Just keep stacking that paper and making it grow

I know suffering I fell your pain
It's hard to keep the cheddar coming in
Wanna survive, then you've gotta stay hustling?
Struggling chasing the doe
Just keep stacking that paper and making it grow

But I find it hard for me to cope
Even when I'm paid, I'm always broke
I got more going out than I've got coming in
Can't buy certain things, no ice style ring, no bling bling
No 20 inch rims spinning, just a sinking feeling
No this can't be living I need at least a million

Better get moving if you want that
Bread is there for the taking better get your share

Yeah
You can find a way
