WasteMan:Bugzy Malone
Oh boy.
Bugzy Malone
You know?
Watch this
I got a phone call from Jammer.
Hahahaha
Nah, I'm only playing
But it turns out I gotta teach man some manners
I was on my way back from a big show
Man are tryna make EPs about me
But let me explain why that don't matter
People lie, numbers don't
People fade, numbers won't
Numbers make people go broke
Now we got a popstar talking like he's road
How was it light work if it took five months?
Five months is a long time to be ghost
You look so stressed out, I hope you've not been
Drinking again, that's a downward slope
How do you go from pop back to the grime scene?
Wasteman
He shaved off the shit on the back of his head cause of me
Wasteman
He got relegated and kicked straight out of the league
Wasteman
Now he comes back in a Velour tracksuit, how you mean?
Wasteman
I had to start training again
Cause I heard it was gonna start raining again
My biro dried up but it doesn't matter
Cause my lyrics don't get made in a pen
My lyrics, they go straight to your head
To the point that I made man take an offence
I made man chop off his mohawk
Before he came back ranting and raving again
Wait, wait, it's five months too late
The nominations have been done, my friend
You can bring out six tracks in one week
But a hat trick sounds like a desperate attempt
You made 46 Bars of Pretend
If you ask me, that was a waste of a send
I will open your headspace, making a mess
I'm Freddy Krueger, you're Jason again
How do you go from pop back to the grime scene?
Wasteman
He shaved off the shit on the back of his head cause of me
Wasteman
He got relegated and kicked straight out of the league
Wasteman
Now he comes back in a Velour tracksuit, how you mean?
Wasteman
We can't have a fight like Ryu and Ken
Cuh we know you can only get brave with a pen
Nobody comes to your shows
Cause it's like watching a zombie waking the dead
Right now I'm on about 50%
My tour's gonna be one major event
When you get booked, nobody turns up
So you might as well do your shows in the Thames
Mad, I can just see the resent
And I know that you've been struggling to pay rent
You don't get shows and your EP flopped
And I've got an EP in the top ten
I roll deep, it's gonna get peak when I'm here
You look like the Crazy Frog with a beard
I left a man six feet deep, then he crawled out of the ground
Now I've gotta done your career
How do you go from pop back to the grime scene?
Wasteman
He shaved off the shit on the back of his head cause of me
Wasteman
He got relegated and kicked straight out of the league
Wasteman
Now he comes back in a Velour tracksuit, how you mean?
Wasteman
Oh boy! (Wasteman!)
Right now, ladies and gentlemen, we've got the main event
(Wasteman!)
And I can't wait to hear what he says next
(Wasteman!)
He must feel like a wasteman!
And in the blue corner
Weighing in at a measly 60lbs
We have a wasteman!
Bugzy Malone
Wasteman!
