Let-s-Go:Frank N Dank
Can we really go
Wanna know about life
Know about nothing nothing
I wanna know about
Don't know about nothing nothing
Can we really go
Roaming in the night with a lot a bit of fright like woah
Do you want to really want to know about life
Do you really want to know
I've been in and outs of everything to do and I don't even want to show
My deepest core my deepest core
I'm lost I'm scared I move so unprepared
My presence always there but my mind can't take your stare
No, no I do not want to see you anymore
No I need to be alone with no remorse
I just needed you to leave and close the door and don't let anybody in so I can feel it on my own

Oh I'm so damn selfish
But I know I can't help it
I'm so damn selfish
Woah wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing
I wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing
I wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing
I wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing nothing no no

Look at me right now, you tell me I'm your warmth
I'm scared as shit right now
I've been feeling insecure
I've been feeling open wounds
I just feel my life is ruined
Think I realized it too soon
I don't like your new perfume
And I know you do not like my tunes
I can take your golden shroom
I will land up on that moon
On my own I know I'll bloom

Oh I'm so damn selfish
But I know I can't help it
I'm so damn selfish
Woah wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing
I wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing
I wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing
I wanna know about life
Cause they don't know about nothing nothing nothing no no

Not a thing no clue
What's even true
I've been questioning my life and the things I gotta do
Beautiful quest I'm blessed but hella stressed cause I've never been obsessed with seeing figures on the checks
But it's not Like I'm against getting racked out
But every time I see a dollar bill I pass out
Cause Jaden built the pyramids
And shit is getting serious
With helicopters flying in the sky getting curious
Oh and what the hell are they doing with the weather
Frequency control say they do it for the better
No I ain't tryin to be corny, people needed to warn me, mother earth is deforming
Yo Mother Earth is descending
People keep pretending like they feel like they remembering now
You got a species with Amnesia and half a billion people getting seizures from grubbin on Micky d's
Utterly disgusted, this is no assumption
Don't you know you function off whatever you've been munchin
I'm really just trusting myself and
Everyone in the world cause everyone is the world and everyone is a world within them
Why you think they call it a universe
Maybe it's United. Something that we separate from and try to define it
Maybe by defining we killin all the beauty
And we wasting all our time
I'm leanin for the vibe and enjoy your celebration of the rhyming when no one categorizes shining of
Any individual finding themselves

Oh I'm so damn selfless
And I know I can't help it
Oh I'm so damn selfless
Woah I wanna know about life
(I don't know a thing, I don't know a thing I don't know a thing, I don't know a thing)
Wanna know about life
(I don't know a thing, I don't know a thing, I don't know a thing I don't know a thing)
Woah woah woah woah
