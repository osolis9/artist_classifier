Fullaschidt-feat-Drea-:Danny!
[Chorus: 'Drea]
Ooo-ooo-ooo, yeah
Y'all niggas is shady, really got me goin' crazy
Ooo-ooo-ooo, I know, I know
Y'all bullshitted me for the last time, yeah
[Verse 1:]
Monday morning, just wakin' up
Someone's cooking bacon up in the kitchen, it's been
A hot minute since I had some pork
"You want some food?" Not spinach, you'll get stabbed with a fork
"Sorry dude, I think I got the last bit of bacon"
I looked up in his face, punk-ass bitch was fakin'
But I wanted some juice; I looked up in the fridge
And this nigga had the bacon hidden under the fruit
I swear to God, yo there's nowhere to hide
It's like they're always tryin' to pull the wool over my eyes
This one chick I never mentioned before
Was like, "You wanna come with me and my friends to the store?"
Cool, I said "yeah", I saw no harm in it
Told her that I'd meet her in the dorm room in four minutes
Showed up, had the biggest surprise
She's like, "C'mon guys, Danny said that he'd give us a ride!"
Huh?
[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
I can't stand it, it's scandalous
The way they try to dismantle this man with this shit
You can't bullshit the bullshitter
But I've been bullshitted so many times, I need a cool pitcher
Of water, so I can calm the fuck down
It's all just a game to these clowns, Round Three
I wouldn't have to put up with half of this crap
If I was packin' a Mac like Richard Roundtree, uh
This one chick tried to play me short
I had her screamin' on the phone 'til it made ME hoarse
I said, "Why come you don't call me no more?
I thought we was close", bitch got defensive as shit
She's like, "Chill nigga 'cause I dropped my phone
And I lost my phone numbers, I'm 'bout to get yours though"
Damn near pulled a hamstring
When I called her two weeks later and she said the same damn thing
