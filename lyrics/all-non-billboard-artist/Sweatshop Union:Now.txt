Something shoulda told me these days would come
Faith is at a low and life weighs a ton
Wanna lay down and die but I'm way too young
And I know we didn't come all this way for nothin'
Flash back five years we was brave and dumb
Wanna rap change the world rearrange the sun
Had hope so we waited 'til the paper come
The paper never came so now we jaded son
Never been about the money it's more the time we spent
Keep thinkin' I'm too old to shuck 'n' jive for rent
Friends ask me what's wrong I gotta lie to them
How can I tell them I no longer feel align with them
Travel the world
Autographs we signin' them
Had enough girls but honestly I'm tired of them
Tryin' to win still livin' in this life of sin
And I would give it all away for some enlightenment
Right now

Right now
Feel like I'm wasting my time
It's like I'm waitin' in line
With no patience to finally make it
And I'm
Trying to find a place to recline
And relieve the stress the
Ways of my mind
'Cus right now its all so fake
I'm trying to escape
And find a little space in time to my self
For my mind to be healthy enough
To deal with some of the cards that I dealt to myself
Right now

It's been a long road it seems
Trying to mold reality from hopes and dreams
And now I'm not so sure its a life I wanted
Might just call it quits get a wife and all that
Just settle down
It's the truth
If I sound a little bitter don't get it misconstrued
Just a bit confused
Sick of driftin' through this life
I wanna see it from a different view
But I aint got what I wanted to get off my chest
Off it yet
Not about to stop and step away
'Cus no one ever dropped a check
Was never in it for the money
Y'all lets not forget
I mean I got respect and that should be enough
I guess five years back it would be but what's next
Don't get me wrong I'm thankful for all this success
I'm not depressed I'm just stressed
Right now

Feel like I'm wasting my time
It's like I'm waitin' in line
With no patience to finally make it
And I'm trying to find a place to recline
And relieve the stress
The ways of my mind
'Cus right now it's all so fake
I'm trying to escape
And find a little bit of space in time for myself
For my mind to be healthy enough
To deal with these cards that I dealt to myself
Right now
