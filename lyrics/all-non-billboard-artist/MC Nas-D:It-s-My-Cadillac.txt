It-s-My-Cadillac:MC Nas-D
I don't know why all them girls wanna ride in Nas-D's cadillac

You wanna know why? It's cuz my...

CADILLAC
Got that
(Bass, bass)
You know my...
CADILLAC
Got that
(Boom, boom)
Yeah, my CADILLAC
Got that
(Bass, bass)
You know my...
CADILLAC
Got that
(Boom, boom)
In it, in it

Yo it's a shame, and also very funny
I can have a decent girl, cuz it's all about that money
When I drive my Cadillac she wants to ride in it to death
If I walk I don't start talkin' cuz it's wastin' my breath
I remember the times I had to put up with the fakin'
But now things have changed, cuz it's records I'm makin'
Packin' hundred dollar Bills as they lose in manilas
Chalkin' girls I just met and takin' 'em to the La Quinta
Cuz my...

When I see other Caddys, I just laugh and shine
Cuz they don't have the boom, that I have hooked in mine
My Caddy is so loud, some neighborhoods ban me
But it just makes it easier for me to get in panties
I wash it everyday, and then I go get crazy
With the hats over our eyes we step, then we go get ladies
Freaky Freddie's in the ride, my number one ace
Peelin' hard in the back of the car with major bass
Cuz it's my...

Bass... drive!
Bass... drive!
Bass... drive!
Bass... drive!
Bass... drive!
10 E-B 12's, yeah holmes it's a winner
10 E-B 12's, rag top and five stars
10 E-B 12's, with the boom in the trunk
10 E-B 12's, so you know I raise Hell

My brougham's real deep, yeah holmes it's a winner
Cuz when a girl sees it, I just chalk and go up in her
And all night long, she's tryin' to treat me at the bar
I don't know if it's my crush, rag top, or five star
With the boom in the trunk, I'll take out any punk
Who are scared and won't admit, they could never get with
The bass, hittin' hard, it put you in a spell
10 E-B 12's, so you know I raise Hell
In my...
