Sizzurp-Feat-Vince-Staples-:Mike G
[Verse 1]
My father said women only listen when you hit em
Gun to my momma head, sittin in the kitchen
I'm sorry I ain't the perfect nigga
I tried to fix it, but nobody listened
So I'm chillin
My only dream is that I die before I hit a billion
Either take an L for dealin cuz im trapped out
Tryna [?] from the crack house
Runnin out of rocks so i'm stuck to the stones they throw at me
Nine times out of the ten i'm not happy
9th grade dreamin of benz's we'll never get
Banging for the hell of it, did it cause we wasn't scared to die
Just afraid to grow up and be something

[Hook]
They gon' love you when you gone nigga
They always love you when you gone nigga

[Verse 2]
I guess y'all fucked with the wrong nigga
Ex girls hatin on me, police bangin' on me
See they just a bigger gang, but that shit's a different story
Livin on the highest story, hopin' i don't fall too hard
Say that you ball too hard, sellin dope is not a job
Is what I tell myself everyday, but it's hard to stop
Kinda like im using, making use of all this time
I bought the rims, you [?] the [?] I shot
Police comin', run around the block
Ain't no need for court, we black so we already lost
Power to the people, seven rounds up in this eagle
Birds baths for your bitch ass
