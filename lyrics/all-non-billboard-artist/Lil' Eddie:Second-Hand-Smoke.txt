Second-Hand-Smoke:Lil' Eddie
[Verse:]
I remember the minute that you changed my life*
Stole my heart like a thief in the night
That day the stars were lined up for me
You pulled on my heart strings, felt so right
It's like you played a lullaby
It was the sweetest melody
Ohh I knew it was too good to be real
My whole world suddenly gone down hill
You treat me like your I'm enemy
Now I'm seeing different sides you've never relieved
I want to believe that time would heal us
But that's just too far to see

[Chorus:]
You make it hard to breath
And every time I'm about to let you go
Can't say it cause I start to choke
Stuck in your second hand smoke
Baby let me breath
Couldn't see we were going down this road
I'm wishing I never met ya
Stuck in the second hand smoke
Just can't let you go
I can't let you go
Stuck in the second hand smoke
Wish I could let you go
I wish I could let you go
Let you go (let you go)
Stuck in the second hand smoke

[Verse:]
Now a days I'm hiding from all my friends
Don't want to let them see my condition
There's only one medication
But see the love that I need just don't want me
Id rather deal with an injury
Cause at least I know that pain would leave

[Chorus:]
You make it hard to breath
And every time I'm about to let you go
Can't say it cause I start to choke
Stuck in your second hand smoke
Baby let me breath
Couldn't see we were going down this road
I'm wishing that I never met ya
Stuck in the second hand smoke
Just can't let you go
I can't let you go
Stuck in the second hand smoke
Wish I could let you go
I wish I could let you go
Let you go (let you go)
Stuck in the second hand smoke

[Bridge:]
I know the fogging smoke would clear
But my love won't disappear
You got my heart so blinded yeahh
And every time that I run
I have to stop to inhale
You steal the breath from my lungs

You make it hard to breath
And every time I'm about to let you go
Can't say it cause I'm start to choke
Stuck in your second hand smoke
Baby let me breath
Couldn't see we were going down this road
Wish I never met ya
Stuck in the second hand smoke
Just can't let you goo
I can't let you goo
Stuck in the second hand smoke
Wish I could let you go
I wish I could let you go
Let you go (let you go)
I wish I could let you go

Ohh yeahhh...
