Deserves-It:Khalil
Feel like something's different
Used to havin' you in my bed
In the morning when I'm wakin'
Breakfast she'll be makin', nah
Something that I never said
Granted I would take ya

Put 'em back on
Faster ain't no stallin'
Catch ya when you're falling down
This that shit good I been talkin' bout
Same reason we been falling out
Same reason you don't mention when I be calling out
What's this all about?

No this ain't just physical
And you swear there's no one different, no
Can't blame that you dear
Just out for someone else
It's more than physical
Even through the ups and downs
Know I'ma stick with you, yeah

You're the only one I give attention to
Just you
Only one that deserves it
No one understands me like you do
Just you, whoah
Just you baby
You're the only one I give attention to
Just you
Only one that deserves it
No one understands me like you do
Just you, whoah

I feel like you should listen
Listen to the things I gotta say
It's more important than you're thinking
Lately we been sinking, nah
Even after everything that's been said
I know that you're worth the risk

Put 'em back on
Faster ain't no stallin'
Catch ya when you're falling down
This that shit good I been talkin' bout
Same reason we been falling out
Same reason you don't mention when I be calling out
What's this all about no?

No this ain't just physical
And you swear there's no one different, no
Can't blame that you dear
Just out for someone else
It's more than physical
Even through the ups and downs
Know I'ma stick with you, yeah

You're the only one I give attention to
Just you
Only one that deserves it
No one understands me like you do
Just you, whoah
Just you baby
I know you're the only one I give attention to
Just you
Only one that deserves it
No one understands me like you do
Just you, whoah

Yep, only one
You're the only one I give attention to
Just you
Only one that deserves it
No one understands me like you do
Just you, whoah

No, that feels like something's different now
Come over
It feels like you take it for granted
All te things I did for ya
When you can't manage and you need a show girl
What the fuck else you gon' do girl?
(Now kill it)

You're the only one I give attention to
Just you
Only one that deserves it
No one understands me like you do
