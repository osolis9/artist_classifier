I-Need-A-Miracle-Radio-Edit:Coco
if you're gonna save the day
And you're hearing what I say
I feel your touch, your kiss
it's not enough

if you believe in me
don't think my love is for free
I won't take nothing less
than a deeper love

oh! let me tell you, you
you know I
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
it's more than physical
what I need
to feel from you

let me tell you, you
you know I
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
what I need
to feel from you

tell me that you understand
and you take me as I am
you'll always be the one
to give me everything

just when I thought
that no one cared
you're the answer
to my prayers
you lift my spirit high
come on and rescue me

oh let me tell you, you
you know I
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
what I need
to feel from you

Let me tell you, you
you know I
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
it's more than physical
what I need
to feel from you

oh! let me tell you, you
you know I
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
it's more than physical
what I need
to feel from you

oh let me tell you
let me tell you
I need a miracle
I need a miracle.
