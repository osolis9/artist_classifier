One of them jump-out boys jackin toys out their cars i remember
Miami ways the 95 the greeze in decemeber, thats why the years go by so fast, it seems like yesterday i used to sport that pleather MC Efember,
Tryna be a jack-boy meanwhile Calerious would grab them guz ass chip off and let em laugh at em, The white boys wearin Edwin jeans, Thought them white girls was pretty on MTV, raps was the first time i heard a newyork rapper before that base music was the thing that i blasted out the boombox tupac digital underground thuglife mothafucka i get around, come in the city where they think us clowns, disrespected our music look at us now, crunk music all it is is base music slowed down, we them boys that made our city proud, how ironic is that,
