Don't tell me that this won't happen 
I'll prove you wrong 
You don't see what i see girl 
But maybe through this song 
You'll understand my intentions 
I've moved on, the fires out 
So let the ashes lay 

Aye yo I've moved on 
Cause im a better man 
Through the lifestyle that i lead 
And i know i just won't look back 
I wanna let you know 
Even though we've been apart 
I feel it in my heart 

You know i feel no way 
Cause every time i say i love you 
You feel that 
I can see it in your face 
So i hold my breath 
Say where, and im there 
Say yes, and I've answered your prayers 

(All we can do is try) 
Wanna hold you 
Wanna love you 
Wanna feel you (try) 
And you'll never understand 
How much I've missed you 
(All we can do is try) 
Girl i need you 
Wanna live you 
Wanna breathe you 
So let's start again 

(Lets start again) x4 

Maybe girl we could start again 
I know it was unfair how i acted back then 
I was unaware too distracted, plus 
We never interacted much 
But now it's certain when i look into your eyes 
Mind, body and soul 
Put your lips on mine 
Let's lose control 
All we can do is try 
And I'll give you everything till the day that I die 


(All we can do is try) 
Wanna hold you 
Wanna love you 
Wanna feel you (try) 
And you'll never understand 
How much I've missed you 
(All we can do is try) 
Girl i need you 
Wanna live you 
Wanna breathe you 
So let's start again 

(Lets start again) x4 

You don't see what i see girl 
But maybe through this song 
You'll understand my intentions 
I've moved on, the fires out 
So let the ashes lay 

I've moved on, the fires out 
I'm a changed man 
Believe me now 
Hope that 
Thought within 
Let us start again (x4)
