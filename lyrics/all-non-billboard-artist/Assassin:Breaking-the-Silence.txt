Breaking-the-Silence:Assassin
Breaking the silence with total ultra violence, no denience of the urge to kill the beast,
Aggressive frustration, excessive mutilation, my vision becomes reality,
Massive execution, is the final solution, human pollution is ceded to exist,
Darkness descents, no more mercy no repents, no defense hence it's so tense.

"CRUSH KILL DESTROY" What you gonna do when you kill to enjoy.
"FIRE DEATH DECAY" Out of control and forever to stay.

Pulling the triiger, rage is growing bigger, it's so bitter that you rather kill yourself in vain,
Determined extinction, full extermination, devastation to implement your pain,
Hatred oppression, a rage of pure aggression, annihilation of the world til extinct,
Taste the weapon of death, with your final breath, nothing left, the overkill begins.

"CRUSH KILL DESTROY" What you gonna do when you kill to enjoy.
"FIRE DEATH DECAY" Out of control and forever to stay.
"DEATH SQUAD ATTACK" You'll never be safe and they always be back.
"HERE COMES THE PAIN" You can't deny the truth.
You can't deny, you can't deny, you can't deny the truth! Here comes the pain!

I see panic eruption, only mass destruction, the deduction of the human race my plead,
Perfect precision is my holy inquisition and the mission till your final defeat,
With hurry and haste, not a moment to waste, the full taste of your perishment to see,
Sadistic excitement, see you die is my enlightment, the last statement of the highest degree.

"CRUSH KILL DESTROY" What you gonna do when you kill to enjoy.
"FIRE DEATH DECAY" Out of control and forever to stay.
"DEATH SQUAD ATTACK" You'll never be safe and they always be back.
"HERE COMES THE PAIN" You can't deny the truth.
You can't deny, you can't deny, you can't deny the truth!
The gulty ones I'll punish and I will take this life from you! Here comes the pain!
