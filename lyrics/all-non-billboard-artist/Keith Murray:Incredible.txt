Incredible:Keith Murray
I'm incredible, I mix up shit like cake mix
Keep it blazin' hot, rhymes burn to keep you frost bit
MC's is assed-out 'cause they lost it
Peep my foundation, the way I reinforce it

I monitor movements, precisely
Makin' niggas hit high notes, like the Eisley's
Finally, some asses I can touch up
Tie 'em to the grill of my six, pop the clutch up

Hush up, I rush up, inside your cut
Make you puss up, then bust up, 'cause my shit bumps
This Don's Trumps, kill straight cats and all chumps
'Cause life is like a box of chocolate, Mr. Gump

Uh, the ultimatum, lets abbreviate 'em
LL platinum again, don't you hate 'em?
A thin line between darkness and sunshine
Five percenters that was raised on swine

Known to be wise, and you wise to understand
Bringin' me drama's a handstand in quicksand
I've been hot so long, I'm immune
Your rap career get cut short like poom-pooms

Now, from the streets to the suites and all around the world
They all recognize we incredible
We can stand in the water and can't get wet
You can bet your last dollar we incredible

We gets it on in the worst way
All the homeboys and the girls say we incredible
From one brother to another
They agree with each other, lyrically we both incredible

Adios, mios, Montageune
We're too hot to hold and too bold to be controlled
Roodies skin-deep, my ugly comes from the soul
I find the leaks, and E plug the holes

I have more beef than fillet mignon
But got smart, and flushed the bullshit down the como
Rappers just started rappin' last week, get a deal next week
And go platinum next month

But pass the blunt, so I can stay hy-like-dro
Don't act like you don't know, I'm 'bout to fly a flow
I'm three from three from a three-point land
With more devastation than a nigga can withstand

Remember me? Untouched by any emcee
I add verbal assault to your mental injury
'Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it
Five O said freeze, man I blowed it

Rhyme strategies, no one's bad as this
I sew up the populace like a seamstress
A prisoner, doing time and the bit
A grown man, and don't play with no kids 'cause I'm incredible

Now, from the streets to the suites and all around the world
They all recognize we incredible
We can stand in the water and can't get wet
You can bet your last dollar we incredible

We gets it on in the worst way
All the homeboys and the girls say we incredible
From one brother to another
They agree with each other, lyrically we both incredible

Incredible, lyrically we are both incredible
Incredible, incredible
