Conquer:King Just
[Intro: ~King Just~]
The beginning, the end*
The Alpha, the Omega
Yo, it's time to conquer

[Chorus: ~King Just~ {*CL Smooth Sample*}]
No matter, what or who you are
Got the shot that ring so far
And we gon' do what we got to do
To get this money (battle physically, conquer mentally)
They can't stop the shining stars
The horror robbers on they job
And we gon' keep on making hits
For everybody

[King Just:]
Yo, I can't stand the rain, pouring down on my brain
Nigga still caught up in the game
Try'nna maintain, but the pain I feel is so real
That's why I ain't for a record deal
I wear my rhymes like a shield of armor
I hold the castle gates until Shitty, Real and Donna
Touch ground, like a touchdown, come, come now
Ain't no way in hell, instrumental or acapell'
I build my skill on the H-I Double L, Hill, niggas know the deal
For real, that's why they all keep they distance
Record label rebels that run with the resistance
Persistent, ain't we, with money in the bank, G.
Hip hop needed a savior, so ya'll should thank me
But instead ya'll wanna hang me like the Klan
Used to be my man, now you see me as a fan
Or a six camp rhyme groupie, how many loops does it take to loop me
On the LP, where all pimps and hoes be
And sold g, to this industry
I thought slavery was abolished
I guess they brought it back with a new line shine of polish
We all didn't see college, there's no power, without knowledge
That's why I stack dollars and don't give a fuck how you holla
So don't bother, on fabricating on the saga
Talking like you kicking down spots in the carter
If that was true, you would have to deal with the drama
From the man, slash comma, all day at the horror, what? what? what?

[Repeat Chorus:]

[King Just:]
Go for yours as I'm about to get mines
King this and King that, in everybody's rhymes
I wish they come straight to the point
Cuz we can make at any rap seminar throwing joints
Point tooken and taken, I ain't mad cuz you made it
But don't fake it, niggas take this hip hop shit for granted
Only grow with the fertilized seeds that were planted
In the holy soil, went from it's grain, to it's royal
High, mob affiliated, B-U-M-P-Y
Never try, cuz when you try, nigga you fail
And I ain't see an MC yet to touch the third rail
Third world scale, if you blind, read me like brail
Horror storm, nigga, rain like snow, sleet and hail
Your rap voodoo is doo-doo, who you?
Acting like you fresh out the box, brand new
You ain't got the muscle to tussle, left the hustle
So we can do the doggin' shuffle
No more struggle, now it's strictly 'good times'
Like JJ Evans, yo, Just is Dy-no-mite
Well allright! Freakin'-A!
Yo I bake like a cake in my rap souffle
My forte, is hitting 52 states
With the kids behind the black iron gates
Can you relate? Zoo is bombing, you've been warned
Heed the warning, horror storming

[Repeat Chorus:]
