Freeform fetish medicine for your headaches
We bomb fellas, better send for the medics
Napalm telepath tightrope walker
Stay on mellow as quite dope author
Night stalker, Charlie Mann's my man
Avid attic mic smoker out in Amsterdam
Black Barishnykov with the gift to floss
In fact you pissed me off and you gets the jaw smashed
This here's the rawness that ripped em off
And wack shit gets dissolved as the gift revolves
around earth space agent that'll rock ya pah
Have you runnin for your Gramps for a lil baklava
Let me, talk to y'all bout some off the wall
rapper wannabe in front of me that got the balls
to not know who the G.A.B. be me
The nocturnal, elite MC, they flee from
Ease on down the rhyme train trap design aimed
at your mind, came back to shine, play it back
The time and days of the last breaths of life
leave your spine ablaze when my ass bless the mic, c'mon

One! *echoes*

One of a kind.
Let me, steadily, wreck the, melody
Check the, Cherokee, techniques, varying
every week, next week, instead of these
head'll be like - let's see, exiting the next brain
Let's speak, hypothetically you are extremely extinct
I phonetically the hip-hop, be the best thing
By the power vested in me, I keep flexing
Now it's G-I-F to the T, come now, test me
Gets things, done when I think and my thoughts distinct
I'm the link in the lock that's missing
Find a pea in the pod that's glistening, shining, it's me
History, in the making awakening this industry
to this beat I'm christening it's sizzling
In this thing, intuitive thoughts just like gypsies
It's risky, when you want a bout with mic's Big Chief
I rip these, and do it out loud while y'all lip sync
You pygmy, you'll never get rid of me, renege this
against me inevitably y'all gon' dig me
Essentially, incredible feat, of raw energy
Immensely, embedded inside y'all intensely

One! *echoes*
