No-Way:Bars and Melody
Check it, I think I lost my sound and found it
That special moment that sparked my thoughts, and now I based my life around it
I hit my head so hard, back before I couldn't count
That now my head has a permanent imprint of my pain around it
Now my pain, inspires me to fight on
You could take my life, and you could still find my smile on
But I'm alive and want for us to be one
'Cause always fighting with each other no, no that ain't fun
Don't contain your fire let it flood through your veins
The lion the king of the jungle, I don't think he'd be tamed
I keep you close to my heart and show you how I feel
And I ain't playing around, I just want to keep it real
My real feelings take control of me
Showing me what I once thought was a dream that has now become reality
I love you all with all my heart and we can be one
We can fill this room with flames outshining the sun

No way, nothing's ever gonna stop us now

No way, nothing's ever gonna bring us down today
We are tough, we are strong, we will keep holding on
We believe we'll achieve our dreams today
Nothing's ever gonna slow us down today
Nothing's ever gonna bring us down, no way
We are tough, we are strong, we will keep holding on
We believe we'll achieve our dreams today

I want to be accepted, I don't want to be looked down upon

Don't want to be neglected, I want to put it in a song
So we can sing together and feel a part of something
Without this feeling of belonging, we'd be left with nothing
And everything can change, your life, you're doing it right
People think that you're insane, you think of it all night
No sleep, you can't eat and you don't want to express
How you feel and your emotions they make you depressed
I feel the rotation of the world, it slows down
And that feeling of hate, it leaves in a breath
Scream until you're liberated of this feeling
Raise the ceiling and the meaning of your life will be clear
We will not fall
We'll be standing hand in hand and we will fight through it all
Outshining the sun

Let it be and come together we will always be one!

No way, nothing's ever gonna stop us now
No way, nothing's ever gonna bring us down today
We are tough, we are strong, we will keep holding on
We believe we'll achieve our dreams today
Nothing's ever gonna slow us down today
Nothing's ever gonna bring us down, no way
We are tough, we are strong, we will keep holding on

We believe we'll achieve our dreams today

We'll be fine, there's always light at the end of the tunnel
Stars collide, there's always light at the end of the tunnel

We'll be fine, there's always light at the end of the tunnel
Stars collide, there's always light at the end of the tunnel

Nothing's ever gonna stop us now
No way, nothing's ever gonna bring us down today
We are tough, we are strong, we will keep holding on
We believe we'll achieve our dreams today
Nothing's ever gonna slow us down today
Nothing's ever gonna bring us down, no way

We are tough, we are strong, we will keep holding on
We believe we'll achieve our dreams today

All the fear that I have is inside of my head
Never listen to the hate, feel the love instead
And I know I'm not the norm but my blood is warm
I have a beating heart. Do I still belong?
If you believe in yourself and put your heart into your dreams
You will find peace but its never what it seems
I'm an ordinary kid, with an ordinary mind
Your life is what you make it. See the colour, don't be blind
