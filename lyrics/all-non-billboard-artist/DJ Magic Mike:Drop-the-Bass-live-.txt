THE THING IN THE BASS AMP

Well it got my goat
For heaven's sake!
What? A-Ha!
See something's come over
The people around here
They never leave their comfor zone
What? A-ha!
They seem not to care
So try to steer clear
As the legend goes
Of the mystery house
The old man in his basement chained
A monster in the cabinet
A creature of habit
incredibly inevitable
Incredibly strange
Ever since the day
Just like a parade
When the old man moved to town
The people started losing track
Of important things they'd known
And folks 'round here lost the will
To get things done at all
Ask someone what wwent wrong
They'll say it's not their fault
So when you're feeling might low
Not just a little, but a lot
You realize you're all messed up
But don't feel bad
A voice inside your head says
It's not your fault
The Thing
That climbs into your head at night
The Thing
With selfish teeth and greedy eyes
The Thing
That helps you escape your mistake
The Thing
There's something else that you can blame
THE THING IN THE BASS AMP
He unleashed the beast on the people
When it hit no one cried or screamed
They all went about their business
Getting back to the front of the TV screen
Now the thing, he's part of your
He'll keep your pride alive
And who are they to accuse you?
I guess they think that thing's a lie!
It's a lie!
It's a lie!
It's a lie
It's a lie!
So when you're feeling might low
Not just a little, but a lot
You realize you're all messed up
But don't feel bad
A voice inside your head says
It's not your fault
The Thing
That climbs into your head at night
The Thing
With selfish teeth and greedy eyes
The Thing
That helps you escape your mistake
The Thing
There's something else that you can blame
It's alive!
It's alive!
It's a lie!
