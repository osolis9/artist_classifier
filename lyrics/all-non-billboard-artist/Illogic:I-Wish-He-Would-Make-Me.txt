I-Wish-He-Would-Make-Me:Illogic
Carpe Diem the philosophy I've come to embrace
On a trek to find myself with God and plead my case
I no longer want to straddle the fence of the agnostic
Due to my success within my flesh I've become a hostage
My light doesn't shine anymore the dimmer switch has darkened the filament
I was the sun now I'm a star in the skies of ignorance
My hearts become hate trapped within this frozen puddle
Now dispensing souls reflections soaked in subtle hypocrisy
I've disgraced my own name because I'm living life logically
Consistent with the secular realm an illogistic dichotomy
I haven't lost faith but I misplaced my spirituality
Hope an ocean is created whole relation to float in reality
Cause now I'm trapped in the storms eye
These heavy rains I can't handle
Need to become a lighthouse instead of a flickering candle
I need to rededicate my life don't know if I'm ready
I know I have to make a choice but I wish he would make me
I strayed from the path pre-destined for me
I'm ill now but walking right I'd be an iller emcee
I know I can overcome this rut cause God put it in me
But I have to find it stop walking this earthly road blinded
Every word reads God-given this is my theory
I'm in a place now that doesn't compare to where I could be
I know I can overcome this rut cause God put it in me
But I have to find it and stop walking this earthly road blinded

Due to my reflection I've lost love cause God was an afterthought
Showed me the one prepared for me she was snatched from my heart
I understand the mirror of pain gave a nice view
Revealing what I had to do to be reshaped and made anew
This is hard cause for a while I wouldn't look in God's direction
Pissed cause I had this life of disappointment and rejection
But I come to realize that when I fell in this rut
God was tearing my down so he could built me back up
See I've been known to rock a crowd with an anointing like no other
And be a prime example for my friends and my brothers
Now I need the strength to take this step from this shadow
Giving my silhouette features as my teacher points the arrow
I was told sins wide and righteousness is narrow
I must prepare for it just to be guiding my way through the sea
I know I need to rededicate my life don't know if I'm ready
I know I have to make a choice but I wish he would make me

I'm locked in this cage and only I have the key
I'm trying to pick the lock without surrendering completely
I know I can overcome this rut cause God put it in me
But I have to find it stop walking this earthly road blinded
I tired of having my eyes covered I'm trying to see
The Promised Land over the mountain waiting for me
I know I can overcome this rut cause God put it in me
But I have to find it and stop walking this earthly road blinded

I have to find it and stop walking this earthly road blinded
I have to find it and stop walking this earthly road blinded
I have to find it and stop walking this earthly road blinded
God I wish he would make me
