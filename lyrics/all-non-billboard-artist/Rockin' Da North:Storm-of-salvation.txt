Storm-of-salvation:Rockin' Da North
I always want, someone who I can't get, 
All the love I had - not enough
I always dream of the things I can't get, 
All I got or have ain't enough

What's the matter with me, why can't I be, satisfied, 
Free and see and feel alright
What does it mean, it ain't me or at least not the one
I'm supposed, or used to be like

What's the matter with me, why can't I be, satisfied, 
Free and see and feel alright
What does it mean, it ain't me or at least not the one
I'm supposed, or used to be like

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask

I write sad songs when I'm down and really depressed
When I feel like a clown, left alone, totally unblessed
Feel forgotten by my friends, god and the rest
Of those people around, in the days I now call my best
I write sad songs 'cos of the urge to unleash the mess
Release the bombs plant so deep in my head
To ease my pain, reach "seize fire", a second to rest
And write them for you, I guess this matter connects?
I write sad songs based on the fact
That hidden under every, I mean every ones chest
Is the same heart beating, are the same bad feelings
Lives the same inconvencience, that's now driving me mad
Sad songs are my symbols, my ways to express
Sad songs are my language, my way to confess
Sad songs are the letters I can write the best
I'm writing sad songs, 'cos there is nothing positive left

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask

The last things to loose, are some ones believe
Your own self-esteem and your patience
Far too fast you might think, that the hour is reached
They keep calling the "storm of salvation"

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask

Believe in me
Why don't you have some faith in me?
Trust in me
Why don't you see the good in me?

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask

Have a lil' bit of hope, a lil' bit of trust in me
Have a lil' bit of patience that's enough for me
A lil' bit of love, some hug, a smile for me
That's all I wish or ask
