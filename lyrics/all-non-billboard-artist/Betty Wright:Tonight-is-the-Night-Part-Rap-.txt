Tonight-is-the-Night-Part-Rap-:Betty Wright
First of all I'd like to say good evening
And we're so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
‘Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it's called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman
Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
“We got to somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty'
You see, it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I-I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her
She said, “Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song'
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I'll give you a little while longer
‘Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
‘Cause I don't want you waitin' till I get to the end of my song
Sayin', “Oh, yeah, now I remember'
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin' it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story

Hmm... hmm... mmm... mmm...

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, mmm... mmm...

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child

You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...

You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm... mmm...
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Mmm... hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho... yeah... yeah...

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
That's when you make me feel real, mmm... hmm...
You make me feel real, real good
Oh... oh... whoa... oh... oh... whoa... whoa...
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I've got to thank your love
‘Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it
‘Cause I love you, baby
And I need you, baby
I want you, my love, my love
My, my, my baby
I'll never forget tonight
No, I'll never forget tonight
‘Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
You make me feel real good
And I love you, baby
‘Cause you gave me
Uh, uh, pure love, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, pure love
Said I like that, baby
Uh, uh, pure love
Said I need that, sugar
Uh-uh-uh, pure love
There's nothin' phony about it
Uh-uh, pure love
Your love I can't do without it
Uh-uh-uh, pure love, ooh

I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Mmm... mmm... mmm...

Thank you
Thank you
