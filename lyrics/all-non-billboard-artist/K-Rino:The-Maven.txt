The-Maven:K-Rino
Tonight, on lyrical masterpiece theater
I will be reading one of my great works
"The Maven"

After years of mindless content and frivolous crap
A man became dissatisifed with the condition of rap
The powers dumbed the lyrics down and made the listeners adapt
Soon this mental plague became a blinding mist on the map
But his vision was never phased, because his eyes had been raised
Over time, he came of age and then grew wise in his ways
He reflected on the great artists and some (?)
Then he envisioned hearing one writer who encompassed them all
To overcome this ignorance, nothing was (?) in his thirst
He spent hours collecting readings, studying all of their works
Travelled all over the planet where great thoughts were bestowed
Sat with priests, septors and sages from all parts of the globe
Read relentlessly for weeks before deciding to speak
He mastered every vocal tone and every writing technique
A scholarly product, with a self-made prodigy conscious
He memorised past, present and future bodies of knowledge
Organised it, knowing the solution was soon to be born
His next step, compile it all into a humanly form
Though he was eloquent, and delivered words with intricate timing
And possessed lyrical skill, he had no interest in rhyming
So he ventured down to his lab, which had been his escape
And after working for 20 days straight, an image was shaped
He deposited all his wisdom, every infinite trait
And when he finished, he rendered what he had invented was great
His creation laid on the gurney, one summer he rose
And instantly began to compose the most dominant flows
Every hour of the day, a different style he'd create
And when he spoke, every man woman and child could relate
Just when it seemed the population might be hurled to it's grave
The man smiled because he thought now that the world would be saved
And soon the sky is where the mental surface would be
He had successfully manufactured the perfect MC
The intellect that passed through his brain, the masses obtained
And within days, the nature of the game had drastically changed
Through his sovereign will, deep marvellous thoughts were revealed
And those who held on to the madness, got slaughtered with skill
Lyrical prototype who wrote words for the love, not wages
And the greatness of his rap pages would pass through the ages
The motivation, to make meaningful songs was contagious
Each writer evolved daily through his creative stages
The negative ideologies of life were uprooted
The first 365 day cycle concluded
But on the 366th day it was strange
The creation the man had brought to life was starting to change
Accolades under his name and international fame
Until totally uncontrollably slowly became
Intoxicated by his own flame, so arrogance reigned
The insane notion of world dominance mastered his brain
Exploitation of the game, through the skill that he used
He had evolved into the same thing he was built to remove
Training ingrained in his memory was unmatchable ability
Natural skill indeed, but he was lacking in humility
The builder watched his dream disappearing in haste
With tears in his face, his creation was clearly erased
The mistake that he made in making a rapper of that caliber
He focused on talent and knowledge but added no character
Now it's back in the streets with a savage mystique
Deadly havoc he wreaks with every paragraph he would speak
So the man searched, travelling roads, famined and cold
Looking for a mechanical load in tyrannical mode
Since he designed him, he felt it mandatory to find him
The goal was to catch him, re-activate and then re-align him
As he searched and explored, he saw things were worse than before
Heard a murderous roar, followed up by verses of war
He ran up to a door, where a stranger took him the key
Once inside the voice straight ahead said, "Looking for me?"
And there he was, with a smile as if he liked that he'd found him
His mic was astounding, plus he had disciples around him
As the man approached he heard these three words: "I dare you"
He said "You're not yourself, come back to the lab, I'll repair you.
I can't have you killing rap, so come with me I implore it."
He said, "Your existence versus mine, I'll battle for you it"
He thought, and said "Oh no, I want no parts of a flow,
Why would you turn against a man who taught you all that you know?"
That's when he laughed and said, "I'm the one that you should kneel to"
He said "You stupid fool, you didn't build me I built you!
Programmed you to be like me, I propelled this confusion
Every detail of our history's a spell, a delusion,
Well, I tried to teach you my plan to rebuild on the movement
So I banished you and held you in a hellish seclusion
My craziest deeds, you were just unable to heed
So the idea that you created me, I made you believe."
The man said "I worked on this for years, it's lies that you speak"
He said "I made it to appear it's years, it's only been weeks
I'm the architect of you, and every bar that was formed
Raise your right sleeve, I'm sure you've seen that scar on your arm
How I assembled you is too complex to try to describe
But if you peel that scar you'll notice several wires inside
You were my greatest masterpiece, top of the line of my clones
But I developed you so well you gained a mind of your own
And started spreading conscious thought, east, west, south to the north
So I drew you out of solitude to finish you off
And though it's definite, you possess several lyrical elements
You're scared of expressing it, that's why you're vocally hesitant"
Discouraged, the man dropped his head and said "It's no use"
Looked at the wires in his arm, and slowly pulled them a loose
Then both good and bad ideologies mentally flash
The conscious forces and the wicked forces instantly clash
And everybody in the room vaporized in a flame
Till eventually the two men were all who remain
The anarchy that ensued, caused the world to divide
And the followers of both sides began to collide
And then the ceiling opened up, and they both looked in the sky
There they saw the the giant silhouette of a much bigger guy
He commanded everything to stop, and nobody move
He said "This war is over right now, and both of you lose
You lose because you took the talent that you possessed
And got obsessed with power and used it to conquer the rest
See you were blessed with the blessed, given the lyrical rod
You didn't build this man, that was a deceptive facade"
The other man said "I knew it but, sir, how did I lose?"
The giant said "You had the skill to challenge but you refused"
He said "I came to fix him back, so this fight I'd avoid"
He said "Some things can never be fixed, they must be destroyed
And though you tried to reason with him, don't believe you've succeeded
Many were lost because they didn't have the wisdom they needed
See you deleted all your hard work, your moment was here
But you failed because your power wasn't strong as your fear
This test is completed" They said "Who are you?" Then I spoke
And said, "My name is K-Rino", and I created you both
(Ha ha ha....)
