Searching-For:EROC
Look, don't talk to me if you ain't talking bout what I wanted here
It's hard to stay close to home when love don't live that close to here
See where I'm from it ain't about who you know at all
If I don't come home just know I do live close enough
I love my city I hate my city I love my city I swear I do
I love my mama I love my brother I love my father I love grandma too
But I have to fly away I have to escape the complacant space of my room
I have too I have to do what I need to do so
