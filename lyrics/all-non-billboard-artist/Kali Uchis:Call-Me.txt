Call-Me:Kali Uchis
Call me, you can call me
Boy just call me (call me, call me)
While you stalling, I'm evolving
I'd give all me (call me, call me)
If you want it, I got it
Come get it, imma give it to you
Just as much as you want it
Boy I wanna give it right to you
Don't be afraid, meet me at my estate
Boy, let's escape
When you feel blue and like nobody got you
I will stay by you
It ain't too late, but there ain't time to wait
We can escape
They'll get a clue, we're like rubber, they're glue
I will stick by you
Call me, you can call me
Boy just call me (call me, call me)
While you stalling, I'm evolving
I'd give all me (call me, call me)
I ain't fronting, know you want it
When I give it ima keep it coming
You're an ocean, got me flooded
Now my insides floating, got me gutted
No one do it quite like you
Got me sitting round writing haikus
If you feel lonely or abused
You know that all you gotta do is
Call me, you can call me
Boy just call me (call me, call me)
While you stalling, I'm evolving
I'd give all me (call me, call me)
If you want it, I got it
Come get it, imma give it to you
Just as much as you want it
Boy I wanna give it right to you
