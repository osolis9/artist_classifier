Yeah, eh

Chocolate, oh, strawberry cream
Body oils, candles lit shower, hot steam
Baby, let's just take it up a notch
Can we use the key to open up Pandora's Box?

And I'mma lock it away with a kiss
Tell me, baby, can you keep this secret from your lips?
And if, and let me give you everything I got, oh
Won't you let this, won't you let this G up in your spot?

Let's do something new, yeah
Let me set the mood, yeah, oh
It seems like he just don't know what to do
So tonight, tonight, tonight
It's all about you, you, you, you

It's not about me, me
It's not about me, me
Oh baby, take your shoes off
Won't you sit and cool off?
It's not about me, me
It's all about you, you, yeah

Peppermint kiss, juicy couture
All of my time, baby, it's yours
Tell me that you coming, I'm awake
You know Mr.CD of the Wendy's open late

You see the ace of that rose, we should touchdown
We be kicking it, it's good
He ain't done it right
If you ain't had it quite like this, like this

Let's do something new, yeah
Let me set the mood, yeah, oh
So baby, tell me what you wanna do
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight
It's all about you, you, you, you

Oh baby, take your shoes off
Won't you sit and cool off?
Girl, you know that it's not about me, me

As I rock the boat, rock the boat
On the river, river, river , river
You know how we float, how we go

To the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
As I rock the boat, rock the boat
On the river, river, river, river
You know how we float, how we go

Let's do something new, yeah
Let me set the mood, yeah, oh
You know exactly what I'm here to do
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight
It's all about you, you, you, you

It's not about me, me

Oh baby, take your shoes off
