Disfigured:Rag'n'Bone Man
I can't give up the ghost
or cut the rope
that talks you down

I you walk in comatose
Obliges the cold
follow the crowd

We'll long live all those lifes
You tell yourselves
You will be allright

But There's no kiss goodbye
Only the end
Only the night

I pitched in like you did
selflessly I thought you'd spare the time
The ones I loved the most
Disfigured it all
the beautiful life

We'll all live all those lifes
You tell yourselves
You will be allright

But There's no kiss goodbye
Only the end
Only the night

It's a cold way to go
to the hollow below
