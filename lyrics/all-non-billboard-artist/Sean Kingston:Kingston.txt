Kingston:Sean Kingston
Kingston, Kingston

  (Kingston)
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready fi war
  (Kingston)
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston me come from, a Kingston me come through

  (Kingston)
I see them coming from afar
The vision thinks that I'm gonna get a scar
  (Kingston)
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston me come from, a Kingston me come through

  (Kingston)
My mom is my hero, two three nine zero
Then doctor was looking at us talk
From then I've been strictly on a mission
I got twenty-twenty vision
All the haters I can spot them from far
I'm sure

  (Kingston)
Jamaicans on slash date
Probably representin' and bringing it home
After I sing my songs
I duck trouble but it keep on lurkin'
Things going too well the Devil start working

  (Kingston)
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open, tough love for ya'll
Crush crush the war, I'm still a young bwoy
That drive all the grown folks right up the wall

  (Kingston)
I'm aware of the snakes cause they near
They plottin' to get me, I'm watching my peers
Bout time in a million, it's close man I swear
I feel it in the air and I'm more than prepared, yeah

I'm what it is, I'm Macdola hype with a game to back
Spitting a big ticket number one in the track
Ease along, baby say ease the bar
My b's the door, 'bout to take the game by storm

  (Kingston)
The one and only, haters got nothing on me
I can feel the vibe, I see it in their eyes
They praying for my demise
They don't want to see me blow yo
Rather see me low low, or I be on the photo

  (Kingston)
But no yo, I'm pull through this game of tug o' war
What you fellas fussing for? Maybe cause I'm grubbing more
Not unless I'm paying my dues, don't hate me
A little hard work will get you here too

  (Kingston)
I got next, better yet I got now
Everybody got faith and yelling cause my hot style
86 the bullshit they don't want me hostile
I'ma reign supreme until the day I drop down

And them on top of the block, and them on top of the skreets
But them a no wan war with we
Cause we bust it and we pop it ah, bust it and we pop it ah
