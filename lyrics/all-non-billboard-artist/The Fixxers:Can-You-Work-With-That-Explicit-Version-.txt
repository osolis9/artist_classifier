Can-You-Work-With-That-Explicit-Version-:The Fixxers
VocĂŞ sabe por que ĂŠ que eu falo coisas pra vocĂŞ?
O que vocĂŞ quer agora?
VocĂŞ sempre 'tĂĄ querendo coisas?
Ah, agora eu entendo
Ah, vocĂŞ quer que eu faĂ§a isso?
OK, 'tĂĄ bem

I can be a little picky, blame the sticky icky
Pick a bottle get a glass down the sippy sippy
I see you baby keep bouncing on your tippy toes
When the beat drop dip and make your booty roll
Cold peace of work filling out your mini skirt
It's saturday night you'll prolly wear that shit to church
You sick of lame dudes frontin' wit' an attitude
Talkin bout their rims and all they damn tennis shoes
I got some grown man game for your bluetooth
I'm hot middle of winter coupe no roof
You used to sushi, vino and some calamari
You want a nigga that might grow up to be somebody
O.T resorts by the sea sand between toes
Umbrella in ya' drinks
Worldwide aim, hit me on the G mail
I brought my boy wit me so bring another female

Diamonds on my fingers a couple on my toes
Walked in to the party and seen so many hoes
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that
Cali to the A we speeding down the freeway
In the stretch LS baby we hood fellas
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that

Let me do my job girl don't make it easy for me
Tomorrow morning make my eggs wit onions chessy for me
Come get the keys to the suite up at the Sofitel
It's room 1024, and I'mma meet you there
Take a bubble bath get the robe out the closet
And wait for me don't think I'm afraid to toss it
You hate for me to stand up cause it makes you nauseous
It's late but can't go to sleep cause your pussy gorgeous
It's quik baby I didn't drop the dj
You might find me GA showin off my LA
So many apple bottom freaks showin' belly
I might give 'em my celly take 'em to the telly
She in the doubletree suites wit her hands on hips
A look in her eyes smile on her lips
It's that soothern hospitality thats my reality
Hit the waffle house and finish wit' some alize

Diamonds on my fingers a couple on my toes
Walked in to the party seen so many hoes
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that
Cali to the A we speeding down the freeway
In the stretch LS baby we hood fellas
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that
I can work wit that
