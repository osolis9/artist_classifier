Rest-of-My-Life-Tribute-to-Ludacris-and-Usher-and-David-Guetta:The Dream Team
If you live for something
You're not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
And toast to life
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks at night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tic toc to life
To arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a road
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes
Just to open my soul
And tonight is the night
I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks
Me and usher are about to break some rules
Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for all, and yes I'm not here to fall
But for what it's worth I'm ready to play
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
If I got one life to live, I'mma party til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Tryna keep my balance I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Ring on my tomb, don't you say women, weed and alcohol
Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for all, and yes I'm not here to fall
But for what it's worth I'm ready to play
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
If you live for something
You're not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup, lift your light up
And toast to life
I'm stuck in this moment
Freeze the haste of time
Cause I feel inner peace
When I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy
But I like to roll the dice
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
