I don't need you to believe me

I'm not her man or lover
We understand each other
It's somethin' 'bout the cover
We always usin' rubber

She loves to go down
I never return the favor
That's why she so down
Creepin' so much, you would think we neighbors

She loves to keep it deep inside her
I would say a definite rider
And just because of the player she chose
It doesn't mean I'ma give her the go

She won't roll with a player like you

She callin' me 'cause she's in the need
Of a player like me that's stackin' G's

Better bring it back, pull it back
Don't be mad 'cause your girl keep callin'
23's coop, she's callin' me 'cause your boy is ballin'

I know that she's gotta man
With a game plan, with the weddin' plan
But I'm not the man, we're not holdin' hands
But whatchu have, your man don't understand

She's callin' me up when she leave her job
That's what's up, when she leave the club

You hear my phone ringin'
She callin' for a reason
No time for any teasin'
This time what friends you bringin'

Some say it's a booty call
It might be new to ya'll
Never trick my dawg, never lick 'em low
Y'all already know what player she chose

So I pick her up 'round quarter to 8
Chop the block and at quarter to 8
Getcha hot 'cause I know you can't wait
Pretty face but I give her her space

So we can do it nice and slow
I mean we can screw it nice and slow
