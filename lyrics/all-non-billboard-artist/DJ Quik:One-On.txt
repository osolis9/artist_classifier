One-On:DJ Quik
Just break it down, c'mon fuck me
You wanna fuck? Suck me
You got a chip? Thank me
Come to daddy, duck me
Any type of position to be miss thang
Just lay it down

Yeah, naw, nu uh, oh wait up
Hold up on you, you got me trippin'
I could've sworn that I just had your coochie drippin'
What happened to all the shit you popped in the spot?
Tell me, is this the position that you want it or not?

Is it feelin' like the way that you imagined it would?
Am I tight, am I hard, is it fly, is it good?
Can I bounce you off my leg?
Like I'm playin' soccer with ya cock and makin' you beg

You feelin', Valentino red that's when that's when you switch
And I'm lookin' for a 2002 bitch
'Cus I'm feathered up like a cock-a-tail baby
But I'm still gangsta, got it glockin' still baby

'Cus I can't take chances with ya man friends
Sockin' you up in the back, where your hands be?
He ain't goin' crazy, he just thinking maybe
Soon as he turn his back, we be going baby

You and me, one on 1 right in front of everyone
You and me, hand in hand we be getting nasty
You and me, one on 1 right in front of everyone
You are so down, down, down, you are, down, down
You are, down, down, down, down

Now I don't know
What I'm gonna do about you baby
Say ya nasty and ya freaky
You playin' the freak

Last night we was drunk at the beach
You was off the E, I was off with the peach
Martini, watchin' you walk around the room in yo bikini
I touched ya stomach, you got steamy

And then I bit you on the hip
Pulled your brown hair back across my chest and bit ya lip
And then I filled your belly button double whip cream
Then I licked ya clit for a hour fifteen

Who the best, baby? Let 'em know, baby
Valentino on ya titty, let it show baby
A K A mista Q U I K
And I don't care what you do, she do what I say

'Cus we share something that nobody here know
Just some up and down sex, not that weird though
In the bed, open window, by the ocean
And the ecs got her lovin' on the slowtion

You and me, one on 1 right in front of everyone
You and me, hand in hand we be getting nasty
You and me, one on 1 right in front of everyone
You are so down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, you are so down, you are so down
