Go-Hard:Sevin
I done been through the rain,
And I have been through the storm.
I done been through the pain.
If you feel me listen up.
Now it can't be strange
To go hard, hard, hard, hard

My young life, fourty none right
kept a gun tight, when we slung white
My use gone, spent to long
tryna do wrong to become right
Had a mom, had a dad
Had a pad I didnt have it bad
But about 13 i had curf dreams
Tryna serve things so I grabbed the bag
