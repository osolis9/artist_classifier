One-Step-Away:Charizma
I never knew Youd be the one to rescue me
But You found me in my need
And how Your saving grace came to set me free
Love unconditional

So I reach for You,
Give my life to You
I'm coming home; I finally found where I belong
And the paradise I see in your eyes
At the break of dawn, when the morning comes
It is only one step away

To all the broken in this lonely world
True light shines to lead us home
Bringing hope to those crying out in need
And the promise of a new day

So I reach for You,
Give my life to You
I'm coming home; I finally found where I belong
And the paradise I see in your eyes
At the break of dawn, when the morning comes
It is only one step away

So I reach for You,
Give my life to You
I'm coming home; I finally found where I belong
And the paradise I see in your eyes
At the break of dawn, when the morning comes
It is only one step away

At the break of dawn, when the morning comes
It is only one step away
