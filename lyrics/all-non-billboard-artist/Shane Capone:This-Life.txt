This-Life:Shane Capone
If life was like a Christmas movie
I wouldn't have a care or worry
And everything
Would always turn out
Fine
Making angels in the snow
Kissing under mistletoe
And everyone would always
Have a
Smile
But baby
Life isn't that easy
Sometimes it gets crazy
I'm falling on my knees
Yeah
I'm hoping for a happy ending
So let's start pretending
What life could be
There'll be dancing and singing
(This Christmas life)
And the bells will be ringing
(This Christmas life)
No more heartaches with heart breaks
(This Christmas life)
Oh I
Wish it could be mine
If I lived up on the North Pole
I would stare out of my window
And look around
At all the shining lights
Christmas carols
Out on the front door
Family at the dinner table
And every night would always end
Just Right
But baby
Life isn't that easy
Sometimes it gets crazy
I'm falling on my knees
Yeah
I'm hoping
For a happy ending
So let's start pretending
What life could be
There'll be dancing and singing
(This Christmas life)
And the bells will be ringing
(This Christmas life)
No more heart aches with heartbreaks
(This Christmas life)
Oh I
Wish it could be mine
So I just close my eyes
And
Create a wonderland
Where
Anything possible
There
I'm just dreaming
Of what it would be
There'll be dancing and singing
(This Christmas life)
And the bells will be ringing
(This Christmas life)
No more heartaches with heartbreaks
(This Christmas life)
Oh I
Wish it could be mine
There'll be dancing and singing
(This Christmas life)
And the bells will be
(Bells will be ringing)
(This Christmas life)
No more heartaches with heartbreaks
(This Christmas life)
Oh I
Wish it could
Be
Mine
(end)
