Out-Of-Tune:A&R
You're always fighting everyone
You were wrong when you were young
You love to think you're on the run, oh!
Had to laugh at all your jokes
Had to tremble 'cos you smoked
Bet you'd never ever get my fun, yeah

You're the one to run from self they say (self they say)
I remember you back in the day (in the day)
Did my best to keep out of the way
Kicked it up in school, singing out of tune

While you're fighting everyone
I've been hanging in the sun
There's a million things I've done, oh!
You're the one who took the lead
Me least likely to succeed
Different now, yeah you agree
Alright!

You're the one to run from self they say (self they say)
I remember you back in the day (in the day)
Did my best to keep out of the way
Kicked it up in school, singing out of tune
Thought you were the rule, singing out of tune

Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
Everybody, keep out of his way
Oh!

You're the one to run from self they say (self they say)
I remember you back in the day (in the day)
Did my best to keep out of the way
Kicked it up in school, singing out of tune
Everybody knew, singing out of tune

Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune

Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune
Singing out of tune
