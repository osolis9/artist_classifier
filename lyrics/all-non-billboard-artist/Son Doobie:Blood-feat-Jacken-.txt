Blood-feat-Jacken-:Son Doobie
Sick jack:
my clique sticks tight cause
my dogs i grew with
some are life time others stay on new shit
im on some sick symphonies down for life
shit i like it.
got my fam with me my dogs i rock mics with
you might think its all business
what the fuck is this?
its music first thats why we got in this
cats from legit turn corrupt when in
gets spread in this camp
that how we avoid the bad in this
it player played enough that is to know
just get me right im on my 28 season
and still breathing but got
cats on these streets that wanna see me bleeding
but i
party and bullshit until its time for me to be leaving
but even though when outside the bloodline
all kinds of slime try to infratrate mine
my minds ready for that its deadly infact
my block grip heavy for that, its not steady
at times...
