All-I-Know-Main-Version-:Rahzel 
And now Ladies and gentlemen, in your right corner
Weighing in at an even 215 pounds
Residing from the South Bronx
Maintaining 39 wins, 40 knockouts and no losses
It's the undisputed beat box champion of the world

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

When I first came out many couldn't catch my name
Now worldwide, feel the affects, scratch my name
Rahzel, now rewind that
Slow it down, you'll find that the way I design that

An' reverb behind that, not in my contract
I'm bustin' all over this bitch, while your girl cums
Down with the Two one fifth, Illadelph, Dy-Nast
R double O T S, no need to remind us

You're far behind us, tryin' to high beam, blind us
Catchin' shinas from a nickle plated niner
Blastin' holes in your designers, this is for you prima donnas
'Cause my persona's like piranhas

I got you second guessin' an' sweatin' like saunas
If you learned from the second lesson, no question you want it
Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer
Goddamn, it feel good to see people up on it

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

Who's the man? Rahzel's the man, so, yo, pass the Method
1200 styles, crush your crew without no effort
Let me flip my vocabulary, vocal acrobatics
Smack up phone dramatics, I can jam like automatics

Nine millimeter, twelve rounds, one in the chamber
Russian Roulette, you can bet, there is danger
Number five in the Billboard with the bullet
One million in my pile, you know the style, let me pull it

'Cause I'm about to blast ya, take the mic, then harrass ya
Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya
1999, octane because I gassed ya
Watch me George Jet on you, son, like I'm NASA

Goddamn, like to compare on blaster
It's the sound effect master
"And I'll destroy anyone, who dares go against me"

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

I got your mouth wide open, just like the Grand Canyon
I'm Trugoy to this rap game, I got game
Call me Denzel, with the rap name, I got aim
'He's on fire' like a coal in a hot flame

Plus my Posdonuses produces your prognosis
Kids doin' the chronic from coast to coast, kid
Death, what the doctor ordered, so say, "Ahh"
Take you 'Three feet high an' risin' like De La

C'est la vie, I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP
Check the outlets for cassettes an' CD
Sam Goody, blockbustin' up your HMV

Nigga, please ask yo mamma for some cheese
Tell her need some restitution like them Vietnamese
In Vietnam 'cause Rahzel drops the bomb
More complex than texts in your Holy Koran

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now

All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
All I know, that's a bad motherfucker
All I know, he's about to drop some shit now
