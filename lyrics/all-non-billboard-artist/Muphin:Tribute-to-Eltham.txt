Tribute-to-Eltham:Muphin
Raised, grazed and bred in Eltham
Played, laid and fed rebellion
So many stories to be tellin
Like the numerous times I fell in
Doggy's doo-doo, now do you
Remember Malabar Crescent?
A pleasant little street
My presence is now discrete
Remember so many so walks with the concrete
Beneath my feet, we thought that we were elite
Don't ever want to delete the memories
I remember we used to walk down Arthur Street to the shops
Late at night stopped by the cops
Grow some rocks on the rooves
Then a lil later came the caper of grooves
Eltham holds the memories that I never want to lose

The station was just a mere stroll
While some called it a hole
That town holds my youthful soul
But nowadays developments have gotten old
Rotten mould scolds the surface
But Eltham did me a service
Served a purpose as this little tacker
Bred this little rapper
Now I would never have been happier
What a place to live, infested with kids
The shit that we did
Cricket on the road, sow the bulbs to explode
Lawns to be mowed, it was all so right
A tight suburb with the odd case of domestic violence
Often neglected silence
There's no defiance, I love that place
Still brings a smile straight to my face
Can't replace the way we would chase through the vacant property
Ran so sloppily, but there was no one stopping me
Or even catching young-blooded fools just after some action
Looking back that town bought me satisfaction
I remember the summers, just relaxing
In Eltham, my favourite suburb of Melbourne
Eltham, Eltham, Eltham

Eltham, Melbourne
Check it, check it
Eltham, my favourite suburb of Melbourne Eltham!
