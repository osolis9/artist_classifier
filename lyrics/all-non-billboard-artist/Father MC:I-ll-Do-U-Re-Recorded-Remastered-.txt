On how I feel and what's on my mind
It's you that I want to be in my life
And if it's possible you will be my wife

Get yo bubble bath ready so I can rub you where not seen
And watch how gentle I'll be when I rub your back
And after that there's aradiant, cognac

A little romance for the quiet storm
And ah, lotta lovin' for the whole night long
I'm gonna caress ya body and give you a kiss
And ah rub you down where you've been missed

Nibble and your navel and kiss your thigh
Play with your hair 'cause I'm on a love high
Well I don't know it's the way that I am
duce me to yo mother and I'll say, 'Hello ma'am"

Well I don't know it's the way I was brought up
Respect my female and never get caught up
In another affair and I believe the same
If you try to be slick then the doors will open

Yeah, you know sweetheart, I told you once
And I don't feel I have to tell you anymore
It's you that I want and it's you, that I'll do for

Since we both know what we want let's get it together
And fly like two birds up a feather
'Cause I'm ah, protect me and look out for my
Feelings and that's why I always try

To be loyal and gentle and lay and lent
Observe the female in case I must leave camp
And if I have to break out you don't deserve
To live a good life and love a black hummin' bird

It may be sexy but it is true
If you try adore then I'll adore you
And if you treat me then
I'll treat you wit opens arms and a rose just to greet you

Love you dearly respect and care for

The way I feel is real from the start
So I stop playin' games and mastered the art
