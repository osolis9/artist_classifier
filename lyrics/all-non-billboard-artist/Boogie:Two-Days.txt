Two-Days:Boogie
Probably the reason I ain't seen you like in two days
You say you love me and turn around and you judge me
I ain't text you like in two days
You say you want and then turn around and say fuck me
I ain't seen you like in two days
You say you love me and turn around and you judge me
I ain't text you like in two days
You say you want and then turn around and say fuck me (I ain't seen like in two days)
It ain't no honoring in death and then you follow with regrets
What a whip, I think I pocket dialed my ex
Really you was purpose I noticed my message was green when
I just seen you made that tweet and ain't respondin' to my text
How it take a little freedom for me to see that equipped
How you give me paradise and turn around and make me trip?
Ducking these broke hearts while making it make sense
Loving that dog filter, but hate when I say bitch
I see you unfollow me, got your ratio poppin'
You know I been lurking, you been erasing my comments
You know I got that app, you better know I had your back
Don't be no lady in the streets and then a thottie on the Snap
I know it's wack 'cause
I ain't seen you like in two days
You say you love me and turn around and you judge me
I ain't text you like in two days
You say you want and then turn around and say fuck me
I ain't seen you like in two days
It's cool if you let go
Let me know I'll be alright
As long as you still know
Hit my phone I might answer
I ain't seen like in two days
You say you love me and turn around and you judge me
I ain't text you in like two days
You say you want and then turn around and say fuck me
I ain't seen like in two days
