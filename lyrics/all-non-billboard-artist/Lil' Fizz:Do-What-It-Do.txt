Do What It Do
It's hot 
(Chea, what's hot?) 
You hot 
(Now tell me something that I don't know) 
Gotta let it do what it do, baby 

[Verse 1:] 
I'm hot 
Thanks ma but I get that a lot 
Girl you see the way I whip down the block 
How them ballas watch 
You remember when I bought this watch 
You even know what they call this watch 
No, I can't even recall the store 
Only droppin a hundred or more 
Losin 'em all then buyin some more 
Damn, Momma said don't take your jewelry on tour but 
It's really just nothing to a boss 
No discussion of the cost 
Just to have the autumn off 
Quit askin me what it is that I'm off 
I'ma stunt through the summer then take the autumn off 
Ma, do you see this coupe 
In a week, you won't even see this coupe 
But if you do, you probably gon see it in blue 
But I'ma keep this black one too 
That's how I do 

[Hook:] 
It's hot 
The way you roll 
The way you rock your clothes 
Pull up in the drop top, slow (Fizzo) 
Gotta let it do what it do, baby 
You hot 
I just let go 
You make me lose control 
Boy you know I can't say no (Fizzo) 
Gotta let it do what it do, baby 

[Verse 2:] 
She digs me, I dig me too 
She loves bein with me 
Hey me too 
So instead of takin one glance 
I take me two 
Like damn, your the coolest dude 
And I know few quite as cool as you 
Like yeah foreel dude 
Cool as a pool is you 
It just don't get done the way it do with you 
She wanna be the one I do it to 
I understand 
God has yet to create another man 
That can make these girls start to shiver and stutter, man 
And none quite as hot as the brother man 
And if so, then he probably my brother then 
Yeah, I'ma fly guy 
All the time fly, I'm 
Higher than the sky line 
How does he find time 
To stay hotter than a mai time 
Blind eyes 
Every time he roll by 
The girls like “oh my!” 

[Hook:] 
It's hot 
The way you roll

Pull up in the drop top, slow (Fizzo)

[Verse 3:] 
I like it (Huh, you like that?) 
I love it (You love that?) 
I kick it (You can kick it) 
Can't get enough of it (Come on) 
I need it (If you need it you can have it) 
I want it (Yeah, uh) 
I love it (Come on baby) 
And you know it (You can roll) 
And you know it (It's Fo'Reel) 
(Let's go)
