High:Johnson & Jonson
I've been crawling
To the mountains
Skinned my knees with blood and hope
If I stayed standing
I'd be drowning
The rising waters made me choke

As I am getting nearer
My mission is coming clear

I know this road
Never seen it before
I know what lies behind unopened doors
I saw the signs from the distant shore
That I couldn't ignore...

I'm heading for higher ground

I left everyone behind me
I took everything I know
Half way up and I'm still climbing
Still a million miles to go

The water is drawing nearer
As everything disappears

I know this road
Never seen it before
I know what lies behind unopened doors
I saw the signs from the distant shore
That I couldn't ignore...

I'm heading for higher ground

And my foot slips
But I don't quit
And my hand grips the rock
Something pulls deep
From within me
Til I get there, I won't stop

I know this road
Never seen it before
I know what lies behind unopened doors
I saw the signs from the distant shore
That I couldn't ignore

I know this road
Never seen it before
I know what lies behind unopened doors
I saw the signs from the distant shore
That I couldn't ignore

I'm heading for higher, higher ground

Way up here, the air is thin
Feels like I could go so far
