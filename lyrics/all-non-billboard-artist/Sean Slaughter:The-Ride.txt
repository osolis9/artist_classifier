The-Ride:Sean Slaughter
I walk in the room like
You should really get to know me
I'm gonna knock you dead
With no cliché
Touché

No fierce girl
No crazy diva
But I'm not quite a señorita
I'm the one they call Good Girl
Maybe I'm the one

Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
I'm the type of girl you find at church
Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
Drama-free and down to earth

Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
I'm the type of girl you show the world
Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
Coming to break down this curse

You may want adventure
But I'ma be a lifetime ride
Got personality
Beauty
Brains
And faith
(like a magnet you'll come around)

Bring the best of the best
Feeling lucky
Place your bet
This girl ain't easy like that

They give you a reason to see me walking away
I give you ten reasons that will make you want to stay
When you get the real deal
You don't want the fairy tale
You know I'm a ten

Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
I'm the type of girl you find at church
Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
Drama-free and down to earth

Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
I'm the type of girl you show the world
Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
Coming to break down this curse

Get Mariah
Mix with Shaniah
Few sparks of fire
Like Miss Alicia
Bold and happy
So Mary Mary
Let me repeat it
Like Keri

Get Mariah
Mix with Shaniah
Few sparks of fire
Like Miss Alicia
Bold and happy
So Mary Mary
You wanna marry,
You know what I'm tend to see

Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
I'm the type of girl you find at church
Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
Drama-free and down to earth

Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
I'm the type of girl you show the world
Nice to meet you I'm a good girl
Coming to break down this curse
