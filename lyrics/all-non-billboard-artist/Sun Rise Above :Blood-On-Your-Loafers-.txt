Blood-On-Your-Loafers-:Sun Rise Above 
Blood in the streets it's deep I'm swimming in it
It's been a minute since you heard the Red Menace spit it
Definitive meaning even when it seems diminutive
Give infinite reasons for doing what is prohibited
Living in a place where bone breaks are actual
Actual raps are backed by factual sources
Forces combine, ride like wild horses
Or more, this rolling stone bowl into the foul forces
That tortures, bodies are hoisted upon the rack
Heart attack serious snatching jewels out of your Prada sack
Part of that, 'cause god's deader than the art of rap
Target that parasitic, political ball bat
Fall back to behind the line as a I design a rhyme
To supply the fighters with an anthem that excite us
Unite us, I just write this and spit igniting the wick
The fight will inflict damage, joy, build and destroy
