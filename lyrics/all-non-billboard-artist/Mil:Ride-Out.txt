Ride-Out:Mil
Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hide outs
Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hide outs

Guerrilla Warfare nigga what ain't no beef
Here come them boys masked up 'bout to flame yo street
You heard that it ain't no game, look we H-O-T
We ride in wars, if we beef then we playin' for keeps
What you ain't found out 'bout us
Cash Money Millionaires slash night riders
Keep it real amongst each other, we don't fuck with outsiders

Nigga if you run up on me you'll catch fifty out a chopper
Now blocka, let 'em burn
Dump him off in a lake and have his family concerned
Then run all in his house and take his money and his children
Wodie my click balled up, do or die niggas
Disagree with us is straight suicide nigga
It's a suicide, it's a suicide
Nigga act like they don't know about you and I

Who am I? The BG
Who are you? Lil Wheezy
Who we be? The HB'z
Where we from? U.P.T.

These niggas never thought they'd be the ones that Mil'd shake down
Get a few crack spots and sell that bitch straight down
But when you ree up you to cut yo cake now
And when you see murder you know you got to break down
Y'all bitch niggas thinkin' life is a cut
Now you cut watchin' niggas fuck your wife in the butt
You was the main thug the club
Now you the main thug stuck in the snub, gettin' back ties in your tub

I kick murder every two bars
Pack two tars, when I cock I need two cars
'Cause I stuff a truck like a turkey
Keep a vest on that deuce deuce ain't gone hurt me
When I get the drop I'll pop while y'all sprayin' with the calico
Box full of bald heads, got you all scared, then hit the block
For you all bread, 'cause when you all post up
I'm leavin' you all dead, leavin' you all dead

You know Mac that Philly cat with the official flow
The pistol will blow, especially if your wrist on glow
Rocks in the watch lookin' like a disco show
Grab the tool put it to the back of your madol
Beanie Sigel, dessert eagle, quick to pop off ten
I only carry guns that knock off limbs
Give out Calcine bags
Lay on the deck when I spray up your set
Who you escapin' the Tec without trace in they neck

I know some dealers who be supplyin' the packs
I'ma guerrilla but you can catch me where the lions be at
It ain't shit for me to ride out and tie up a few cats
Make them show me where they hide out and their valuables at
You can catch me in the kitchen 'bout to break up somethin'
Large block, coffee pot 'bout to bake up somethin'
When I'm broke you can catch me 'bout to shake up somethin'
With that coke for a pound that'll wake up somethin'

Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hide outs
Hot Boys and you know how we ride out
Philly Boys and you know how we ride out
Hot Boys, Philly Boys 'bout to squad out
Ride out, crash niggas hide outs
