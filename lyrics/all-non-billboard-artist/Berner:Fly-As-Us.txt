Fly-As-Us:Berner
As I look back on the days that's gone by
I can't help with the flame what would I've done differently
I'd be at that time

You see baby all I'm asking is for
She's the bell assistance

[Hook:]
Showing up ain't nobody fly as us
You're pawing up ain't nobody high as this
Up to the sky, tell the stars with you baby
Hanging with stars girl look what you are
We just just gotta keep on,
Pawing up ain't nobody high as us

We list she's camera shy, them crazy lips crazy eyes
I'm feeling up, I'm extra fly, she cut the portion
Let me drive I'm on one, new chrome a candy pay with that roof gone
This here the guys just too strong, she like to rub with a blue son
I make em moves on this boos fun, twenty bottles I'm spread the cloud
She hangin round with that empty glass, who ain't anything just to taste it loud
I'm smoked out, bottles up,.. who ball like us
I want some money ans she wanna fuck
Told to keep the watch I want the truck
Choose me that's twenty plus, lots of cash, plenty drugs
Diamond rings version rugs, got an ice gold heart and my blood
I'm an OG cash from around the way
Count big money my kind of thing,
I got white girls, Asian girls and land girls
Give me cash to me, ouh

Fuck nigga dealers but I did it for the label
They just seat no way I'm catching up I'm on the labels
I can't talk about weed, 'cause our nigga stay high
I can't talk about them Benz I really live that
Scared money, don't get money, if ain't about money
The shit just funny, black out for this white
Model for my wife, ain't tricky if you got it
You can have what your life
I got benz like the house of blue
Louie V my favourite shoes,
All my bitches they come in two
Watch what you say I do,
Sold gone like baby rough it
Hustle game like warm buffin
Cold in with the Charlie restin
You broke nigga gonna roll with tussin
