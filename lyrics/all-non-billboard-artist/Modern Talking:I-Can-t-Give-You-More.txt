I can't give you more, I can't give you more
(Can't give, can't give)
I'll never find, what I'm searching for
Can't give, can't give, can't give

Oh I know, that I will die for you
Can't you see, my demotions
Tears may go, but I'm lonely too
My love is, just like the ocean

Oh please come back to me
'Cause I won't dying from nothing
Oh you're not blind to see
Oh I won't dying from nothing
(Can't give, can't give, can't give)

Our love,is just a missin' word
Get two hundred ways to Heaven
It's so tough and my heart oh it hurts
Oh my babe, don't let it happen
