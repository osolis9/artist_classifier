Sittin-Side-Wayz:Paul Wall & Chamillionaire
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

It's the people's champ
I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off
Of the old school Impala

I'm with that Big Bank Hank
That Poppi Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox
Turn the bass up just a notch

You see them blades choppin'
You see that trunk poppin'
Ho's that diss me in the club
The same ho's in the parking lot boppin'

They see me in the Jag
Acting bad with T Ferris
Open mouth and showcase ice
And you gon' see about 20 karats

I'm what they do
You on 5-9 double O
In the Tahoe on 24's
I'm the truth, I got that glow

I'm out that Swisha House
With Archie Lee and Couda Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang
The candy paint dripping off the frame

You see me acting bad
I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say cheese and show my fronts
It's more carrots than Bugs Bunny's lunch

It's Paul Wall, baby
I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil
And I'm paid plus I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

What it do, I'm on the block
Posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind
Putting money in my socks

A legend in the hood
For gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic
For showcasing my verbal skills

I'm in the club posted up
With some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school
Candy Cadillac on swangers

I got a Styrofoam
White cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank
My hustle game sharp as a shank

Big bank take little bank
84's and candy paint
Trying to find some Honey Love
My making game is top rank

These ho's peeping me
Ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation
Trying to figure which car I drive

I'm on the scene strapped up
Like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping
Look at that cold grill and woman

The trunks popped up
My music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot
I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

Maybe O.J's
Ho's be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's
Watch ya ho, watch ya money, watch ya clothes

Single women's out the mold
Glidin' like a ice skater
Motor like a snot nose

Suicide drop doors
Mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck
'Cause the mono block stock lows

Sensei, Don Key, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us
We gon' put it in ya face
[Incomprehensible] scoutin' together when I blaze
Boys smell lemon haze

I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal
That get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat
That ain't got it together

Flossing, breaking of the intersection
Crossing three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the place
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm sittin'

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze
