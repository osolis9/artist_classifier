Feel-the-Flow:S3RL
I need some music
I got the music
I need a melody
So here's a melody
Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving through my whole body
Feel the melody
Sound it takes me higher
To another place
Lose control of myself
When i hear the bass
So let the bass kick
When i'm listening on my headphones
All alone
I'm taken to another world
Other world
Makes me feel like i can fly
Like i cannot ever die
Music is my only drug
Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving through my whole body
Feel the melody
Sound it takes me higher
To another place
Lose control of myself
When i hear the bass
So let the bass kick
Music is my only drug
So let the bass kick
Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving through my whole body
Feel the melody
Sound it takes me higher
To another place
Lose control of myself
When i hear the bass
I need some music
I got the music
I need a melody
So here's a bassdrum
When i'm listening on my headphones
All alone
I'm taken to another world
Other world
Makes me feel like i can fly
Like i cannot ever die
Music is my only drug
So let the bass kick
Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving through my whole body
Sound it takes me higher
To another place
Lose control of myself
When i hear the bass
