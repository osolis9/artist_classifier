Dancing-in-the-Rain:Napoleon Da Legend
Verse 1
When we met it was first like bliss/ seems like every relationship births like this/ Neverthe-less/ it reversed right quick/ must be the reason why the earth spins/ sort of like inertia when the nervousness ends and circumstances kill the romance again/ slow dancing in the midst of chaos/ karaoke notes in a lonely kiosk/ painting of blues color the mood/ have you anything to say other than rude? Walking on soft sand holding hands/ nah nah nah babe that’s no way to talk to a man/ why you adding salt on our plans? It ain’t my fault you a skank/ words hurt/ let’s go let’s make it worse/ let’s wreck this whole universe/ selfish love/ smashing your pelvis up/ Bel Biv Devoe we poison ourselves for what? Oyster shells love/ EAT IT! Michael Jackson love/ BEAT IT! Who the hell cheated? Me or you? Hacking my emails Peek-a-boo! Got my password/ now you got the last word/ crazy ass bird/ trying to make the past work/ even though it never does/ ain’t a thing changed about you/ whatever love…

What we gotta go thru that x8

Verse 2
Who’s that on the text? Who’s that on the phone? Ma! Why you trying to question my zone? Testosterone in my ball sack/ there’s your answer/ that’s what you call that/ Mesmerized as my eyes measure your thighs I apply pressure/ pleasuring your insides/ estrogen vibes from a female view/ seen things different when it came to me and you/ you seen future while I was seeing present/ trying to look past all my flaws and envisioning a weeding/ sky trips and sledding/ outlets in Reading/ I let her in my little world in a second/ minutes and hours quickly turned into years/ and her smile would eventually turn into tears/ your face was a mirror and I saw me there/ stalking at night/ talking bout you saw me there/ and/ blowing me up mami you slowing me up/ heartbroken/ need a night nurse to sow me up/ arguments/ mean mugging in front of the public/ wish I had known you were lugging all of this luggage/ 20/20 hindsight in the limelight/ love is blind right/ time to get my mind right/ as the next one/ steps into my lane I glance/ hold my hand/ step with me in this rain let’s dance…
