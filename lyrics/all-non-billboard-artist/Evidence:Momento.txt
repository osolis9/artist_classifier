Momento:Evidence
Now that you're here, I've nothing to fear
With you is where I belong
I know it I, feel it so strong
Nothing has ever been clearer
That your love is all that I hold so dear

I'll hold on, to every hope I own
I'll hold on, and make this life my own
I won't give up, no I won't run back to the start
Because I know, I know, I know, I'll always have your heart

You're all that I want, and I don't want it any other way
I'll do whatever it takes, I don't care about the stakes
Please never leave, I need you to believe in me

Cause I'll hold on, to every dream I own
I'll hold on, and make this life my own
I won't give up, no I won't run back to the start
Because I know, I know, I know, I'll always have your heart

I'll hold on, to every dream I own
I'll hold on, and make this life my own
I won't give up, no I won't run back to the start
Because I know, I know, I know, I'll always have your heart
