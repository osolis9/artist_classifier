Let-It-Slide:Hurricane
Mondays come and it's way too soon
Been up with the devil
Been shoutin' at the moon
Car won't start and the rent is due
Gotta find me somethin'
To getta me through

Everything's so mixed up baby
Nothing's really ever going to change
Sometimes you gotta step back
And tell yourself
You know the world's insane

Let it slide
When the whole wide crazy world
Just spin you 'round
Let it slide
When it look to you
Like you're just losin' ground
Don't let it get you down
It'll be alright
If you just let it slide

My world ran off
With my best friend
She come back sorry
Then she leave me again
So many people
Tryin' to push me down
Gotta get some laughs
Needa go downtown

Try to remember
That nothin' could ever
Really be that bad
These ain't the best times honey
Still, they're not the worst I ever had
