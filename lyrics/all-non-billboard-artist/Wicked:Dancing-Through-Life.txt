Dancing-Through-Life:Wicked
The trouble with schools is
They always try to teach the wrong lesson
Believe me, I've been kicked out
Of enough of them to know

They want you to become less callow, less shallow
But I say why invite stress in
Stop studying strife
And learn to live the unexamined life

Dancing through life, skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless for the brainless
Why think too hard when it's so soothing

Dancing through life, no need to tough it
When you can sluff it off as I do
Nothing matters but knowing nothing matters
It's just life, so keep dancing through

Dancing through life, swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraught less when you're thoughtless
Those who don't try never look foolish

Dancing through life, mindless and careless
Make sure you're where less trouble in life
Woes are fleeting, blows are glancing
When you're dancing through life

So what's the most swankified place in town?
That would be the Ozdust Ballroom
Sounds perfect

Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom
We'll meet their later tonight
We can dance till it's light
Find the prettiest girl, give her a whirl

Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom
Come on, follow me
You'll be happy to be there

Dancing through life down at the Ozdust
If only because dust is what we come to
Nothing matters but knowing nothing matters
It's just life, so keep dancing through

Miss Galinda
I hope you'll save at least one dance for me
I'll be right there waiting all night
Oh, that's so kind
But you know what would be even kinder?

See that tragically beautiful girl
The one in the chair, it seems so unfair
We should go on a spree and not she, gee
I know someone would be my hero
If that someone were to go invite her

Well, maybe I could invite her
Oh Boq, really?
You would do that for me?
I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda

So?
So I'll be picking you up around eight?
After all

Now that we've met one another
It's clear we deserve each other
You're perfect, you're perfect
So we're perfect together
Born to be forever dancing through life

Oh Elphaba, isn't it wonderful?
Finally for this one night
I'm about to have a fun night
With this munchkin' boy Galinda found for me
And I only wish there were
Something I could do for her to repay her
Elphaba see

We deserve each other
And Galinda helped it come true
We deserve each other, me and Boq
Please Elphaba, try to understand
I do

Galinda, listen
Nessa and I were talking about you just now
And I was just talking about you
I thought you might wanna wear this hat
To the party tonight

It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?
You know, black is this year's pink
You deserve each other
This hat and you, you're both so smart
You deserve each other
So here, out of the goodness of my heart

Listen Nessa
Yes?
Uh, Nessa, I've got something to confess
A reason why, well, why I asked you here tonight

Now I know it isn't fair
Oh, Boq, I know why
You do?
It's because I'm in this chair
And you felt sorry for me
Well, isn't that right?

No, no, it's because, uh, because
Because you are so beautiful
Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful
And we deserve each other
Don't you see, this is our chance
We deserve each other, don't we, Boq?

You know what? Let's dance
What?
Let's dance

Dancing through life down at the Ozdust
If only because dust is what we come to
And the strange thing your life could end up changing
While your dancing through
