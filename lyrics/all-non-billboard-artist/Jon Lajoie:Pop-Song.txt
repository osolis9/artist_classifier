Pop-Song:Jon Lajoie
Girl I'm a sexual attractive man
That makes me a good artist
This is my new single
I hope you like it

Wealthy men hired me
To sing this song
That they wrote for me
They're investing in
This quasi music video
And theyre paying
To get a bid on the radio

Yeah they're gunna sell a million
Yea it's gunna go plat- in - um

Cause they'll market this song
To young impressionable
And insecure teenage girls

Cause all you gotta say is
Ohh baby i love you
And girl I need you in my world

Cause they'll market this song
To young impressionable
And insecure teenage girls

Cause all they gotta do
Is find a sexually attractive man
That can sing all the words

And now the token rap verse
That doesn't make any sense
But helps to get a small percentage
Of the urban music market

Hey baby baby i can tell
That you are crazy crazy
Shake that ass girl
My rhymes are gettin' lazy lazy
These things I'm talkin' bout have
Nothin' to do with the song baby
It doesn't matter
Won't you show me that thong baby

That's how it works
In the pop music industry
2009 mother fucker
That's just how it be

Cause they'll market this song
To young impressionable
And insecure teenage girls

Cause all you gotta say is
Ohh baby I love you
And girl I need you in my world

Cause they'll market this song
To young impressionable
And insecure teenage girls

Cause all they gotta do
Is find a sexually attractive man
That can sing all the words

Now I'm singing with my gay voice
To let you know that I'm sensitive
Oh yea I'm singing with my gay voice
Teenage girls love a sensitive boy

Make money etc
Rich men makin' money off of
Their investments
Ooh it's so sexual baby

Girl I love you so much
I wish we could be together
Unfortunately we cant cause
I'm rich and famous and you're not

But why don't you just go buy my album
And tell your friends about it to
So they also go out and buy it
