Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try
(Try)
Don’t wanna try no more
(Try no more)
Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try
Don’t wanna try no more, ooh
(Don’t wanna try no more)

I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it four years gone down the drain
How I wished things woulda happened so differently
I tried to say this many times but still you couldn’t see
You kept insisting and resisting that you would not fall again

And now you trying to tell me that you're sorry
And you're trying to come back home
You're telling me you really need me crying
Begging, both knees are on the floor

But baby, I don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt you bad to where we both begin to cry

Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try, I ‘bout just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try no more
Tell me what‘s the use of holding on when all we do is hurt our love

You and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up, face reality, it all just seemed too good to be true
After all you put me through

But baby, I don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt you bad to where we both begin to cry

Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try, I ‘bout just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try no more
Tell me what‘s the use of holding on when all we do is hurt our love

Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try
(Try)
Don’t wanna try no more
(Try no more)
Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try, oh oh
(Try, oh oh )
Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try
(Try)
Don’t wanna try no more
(Don’t wanna try no more)

Don’t wanna try, don’t wanna try
Don’t wanna try no more, oh oh
(Try no more, try no more)
