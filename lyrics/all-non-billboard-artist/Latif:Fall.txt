Let me light your love up like a candelabra
‘Cause you deserve this
Home is where you spend the entire weekends
Girl that ain't it
We should be paintin the town
Tearin up the mall
And your head down, but lovin in the rough
Girl I'll walk with you the long way
You're too sexy to be single, that's crazy baby

(Bridge)
Waitin right here
Take one step
I'll be waitin right here
Then just jump
Waitin right here
Don't be scared
Waitin, waitin girl
Baby, fall into my arms
Waitin right here
Take one step
I'll be waitin right here
Girl just jump
Waitin right here
Please don't be scared
To fall into my arms

Fall
And girl I know you hesitate ‘cause in the past what happened to you
Fall
Girl when we get together, it'll be too much yea
Fall
Why do we even gotta ask for?
Maybe that's why you should have a man for
Fall in love in my arms yea

I know what the problem is
It's time for you to trust in this
Can I be monogamous? Yes
Winter, spring, summer, fall,
Seasons are made for love
Girl I need you on my left
You're so amazing
Trust me, I ain't playin with your heart
Ready when you are girl
You got me waitin
I just wanna play my part
My love you say you should just fall in

(Bridge)
Waitin right here
Take one step
I'll be waitin right here
Then just jump
Waitin right here
Don't be scared
Waitin, waitin girl
Baby, fall into my arms
Waitin right here
Take one step
I'll be waitin right here
Girl just jump
Waitin right here
Please don't be scared
To fall into my arms
