I dunno when I'm coming back
I'll be gone for a little while
But I will keep myself for me and you
I'll be back for you
I dunno what the future brings
But I want you to be with me
I go dey hope and pray say make you wait for me
Cos I'll come back for you
Darling
You hold my love
You are my prize
And I'll run to the finish line
My love I no go leave you run
I no go bounce your call
You'll be always on my mind
Yeah yeah
I'll be so far away
Promise you'll wait for me
I go think of you everyday
My love yeah yeah
I may not come today
But I'll be wih you again
I go dey pray for you everyday
My love yeah yeah
As I'm leaving you behind
I'm gonna miss your smile
And the joy you bring to my wretched soul
Your love it makes me whole
This our love will never die
Darling promise you will be mine

For you and me
