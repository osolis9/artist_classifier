Disowned-Inc-:Serj Tankian
I can feel you far away
Your hesitation matching mine
Sadness left me far away
Your contemplation turned to wine

An old man stares at me
In mutual bizarre reverie

Laugh at thy neighbor, pretend you are sane
Just the same, you survived in vain
Laugh at thy neighbor, pretend you are sane
Just the same, you survived in vain

Time is the father of existence
Rhyme the brother of resistance
Broken down by men, in their crazy mind

Void is the mother of unknown distance
Will the sister of persistence
Stripping under the, elusive sky

The potion of devotion
Euphoric scriptures of the ocean

Laugh at thy neighbor, pretend you are sane
Just the same, you survived in vain

Time is the father of existence
Rhyme the brother of resistance
Broken down by men, in their crazy mind

Void is the mother of unknown distance
Will the sister of persistence
Stripping under the, elusive sky

I felt, so alone
Till you came into my life and stopped the pain
I felt, so alone
Then you came into my life and poured the rain

I feel, so alone
Dressed in the dark silk clothing of your own disdain
I feel, so disowned
Since your children took up arms in your own name

God's name's different in every language

God's name's different in every language
Imposed illusion composed dissolution
God's name's different in every language
Imposed illusion composed dissolution
God's name's different in every language
