Intro
During each cycle of life on this very planet 
You have a begining, and you have an ending 
As each cycle accurs 
The souls living are forced to make a descision 
They must choose to live life 
Following either the stoic path of the depoutonous of worship,
that many believe that this will leads to an afterlife of eternal bliss. 
Or they may choose to live life following the obuliant path, of heterminism and non belief. 
Which many believe leads only to eternal damn nation. 
In this day and age, the time of choice is strongly upon us. 
A Lotus of the night. 
A simple Dark Lotus has emerged from sacred soil. 
From this unfolds the single truth. 
Those who believe in the gospel of the Dark Carnival recognize this as a last warning. 
The very next message brought before us will be the almight 6th jokers card. 
For now, let us relish within...... 
The Lotus!!!
