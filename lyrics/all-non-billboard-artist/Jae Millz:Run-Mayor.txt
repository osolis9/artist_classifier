Run-Mayor:Jae Millz
RUN 4 MAYOR*
(Young Money)

[Jae Millz:]
It is so good 
That I might run for mayor
So good I might buy a present for a hater
I just wanna slavor
You just wanna savor
Well good come and get it
Let me get back to my paper
Straight from Harlem 
With the cellars? and the shavers
To a high rise balcony way in the air
Standing on my own
So I don't need no favors
And the clock on my wrist
??????? flavors
Cyclops watch the bitch beam lasers
And all my diamonds dancin' 
Jr. Simmy Davis
Oh that's your girl, 
I make her scream see ya later 
Take her home and maker her seem
Like a nigga ??? her
They all underestimated
But i made it, so I'm wavin'
From that young money flow
While we paradin'
Yeah we the chimps 
And everyday's a celebration
Ain't nobody do it like this in ages
Not only are we young money
Bitch we are the greatest
Catch me in some Jordans for you,
Catch me in some gators
And no I'm not icey bitch
I'm definitely a glacier
Certitified NY wife taker
Old school game like
Walt Clyde Frazier
Pockets all money like a open pager
I grew up in the apartment
But I'm a dime ???

[Tyga;]
Mass murder every tiger hater
And I ain't from Atlanta
But the beat ???
????
Bitches say they love my flavor
Cause I'm a yellow nigga ha
So I rep the Lakers 
?????
Hoes in to many places
Playa playa shit 
Cities next to where they names is
Famous famous shit
Want the cookie with the raisins
I play stages, no games, no segas
Rap ragin', move out my fucken' way bitch
Are u Asian yup smartest in my age group im faded 
And I ain't even off Nathan
So ??? and half of these bitches basic
And I'm loaded we fallin' off
Humpty dumpty
??? yard I'm a fucken' dog
Piss that shit
Write my name on a star
Skinny nigga though
Hoes sufferin' on my straw


[Gudda Gudda:]
Real fly nigga
Bitches see me and they holla!
My shades block the sun rays
Dolce and Gabbana
Louis brief case Louis rag I'm stallin'
Credit cards in my louis wallet
When I'm goin' shoppin'
This is young money 
So the money ain't a problem
Got my daughter wit me
If she want it, then
I'm gonna cop it
All my kids throw a riot
And they get everything, they want it
They just call daddy and
I have to them by the morning
I'm a young paid nigga
Got it made nigga
Not bad, I quit school in the 9th grade nigga
Left my momma house 
I was still an under aged nigga
I was like, fuck it shit,
I gotta get paid nigga
Now its 2010 and we the hotest in the game
It's young money,
Mention money when you say my name
They call me Gudda Gudda
Double G its all the same
Heroine flow, cocaine put it in your vein!
