Shining:1982
Cause when the sun shines, all the world dance
ain't no pit stops, no more girlfriends
who the fuck is you?
Where your story at?
And your life start?
I guess it all depends
Chorus:
And we're walling, standing on the corner of the block
And we're grinding, jumping off *the edge of the* roof
And we're flying, until the world catches up,
And we're shining, and we're shining, and we're shining!
We're shining, until the world catches up
and we're shining, we're shining, until the world catches up
And we're shining!
I'm a bad model, thinking I do what I do
Homie I flow... miracle
Since i left the umbilical, I've been put on the pedestal.
And if I ever comfort you, just... killing you
Eye for an eye, bloody box caught up
It's your time, put that on my ...mother.
I'm a . rock...
Me a... got the check, got the piff, and it's gonna get me with a
I love wearing the crown, love shredding it down
the sun shining and that... is me!
The game... man that ain't diamonds
That's a rapper with a ... in a...
Man, I'm... now that's a...
Chorus:
And we're walling, standing on the corner of the block
And we're grinding, jumping off each others roof
And we're flying, until the world catches up,
And we're shining, and we're shining, and we're shining!
We're shining, until the world catches up
and we're shining, we're shining, until the world catches up
And we're shining!
I'm on the block, with my little homies grind
They say they hope a guy like me come give 'em their rhyme
I can be Fat Joe if I ...
Cause I know... on the radio all the time! my zone
But I'll be on my grind, no sleep player,
No major labels back... just feeding me paper.
Just me on my own, just me on my zone
Watching my clothes get dough...

If... could get me and my...
I'm a cold cat who ...
I'll be shining, people I glow
Night light, flash light ...
If I make it high, and...
I'm gonna stay and keep it on the low
Let's go!
Chorus:
And we're walling, standing on the corner of the block
And we're grinding, jumping off each others roof
And we're flying, until the world catches up,
And we're shining, and we're shining, and we're shining!
We're shining, until the world catches up
and we're shining, we're shining, until the world catches up
And we're shining!
Hey yo, I'm shining like blue and reds on a...
I keep it underground, fuck it...
Cause when you get down, they steal your shit anyway
And make way for the next star to take your place.
It's all fake, hand shakes and funny smells
Funny styles . just to see the money, pall
And they're doing the proud...
.still I do the best to ... whatever block and me
My philosophy is keep it sweet...
I'm a ill rapper on terminology.
Let me slow it down, cause I'll be losing you all
I'm here to put the newses on the fake superstars.
I go super hard, not to be.
And even if we never blow, my crew is still a bomb!
Chorus:
And we're walling, standing on the corner of the block
And we're grinding, jumping off each others roof
And we're flying, until the world catches up,
And we're shining, and we're shining, and we're shining!
We're shining, until the world catches up
and we're shining, we're shining, until the world catches up
And we're shining!
See I'm flying, we're flying,
jumping off the roof and we're flying!
The sun so blind, that's so bright, your whole night
Shine me, shine me, grab a flat light and shy me
Shy me, shy me...
keep shining me
We're shinning, we're shinning!
