Seize-the-Day:Bless
Hey oh well it's my turn now
You've just lost your precious spot somehow
Me i'll take it all away
No one ever dreamed you'd up and walk away
You'd love to watch me be the throwaway
Just when i can finally seize the day
Take your self and disappear
You are still no longer welcome here
Fear drives you to act this way
The sum of all you've done will be the debt that you pay
You'd love to watch me be the throwaway
Just when i can finally seize the day
With the fear of losing it to you
I'll keep it close and finally break on through
You'd love to watch me be the throwaway
Just when i can finally seize the day
With the fear of losing it to you
I'll keep it close and finally break on through
