Human After All
Is it any wonder now the stars around me 
Are not the brightest of them all 
From standing proud to falling like a domino down 
And out somehow 
All that I remeber now about being by your side 
Is having just the most amazing time 
But nothing lasts forever 
We're just human after all 

I feel stronger now but it's not easy 
To feel the pride after the fall 
Feeling like I've gotta go 
So it's looking like I'll never know 
Why you left at all 
It'll hit you with the power at any time, at any hour 
But we can learn to make it if we all stand tall 
It doesn't have to matter 
We're just human after all 

I work it out and I feel somehow 
That you were bringing out the best in me 
So why do I feel down when changes always do you good? 
Am I feeling like I should? 

From standing proud to falling like a domino down 
And out somehow It'll hit you with the power 
at any time, at any hour 
Let it be a lesson to you all 
Your crying doesn't matter 

It doesn't matter at all 
We're just human 
It doesn't matter at all 
We're just human 
It doesn't matter at all 
We're just human
