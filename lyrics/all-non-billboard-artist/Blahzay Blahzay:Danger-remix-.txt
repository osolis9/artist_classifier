Danger-remix-:Blahzay Blahzay
*Oh my God* [[Q-Tip]]
*When The East is in the house* [[Jeru The Damaja]]

Put out the word Blahzay has emerged
Surged, most prefered from the verbs and words
I finesse, try your best to diagnose
when I host, you gettin' roast, toast
Bet grip bra when I rumble, you crumble
My stuff is good like mo dumgoe
soup. Rappers getting suit front and rugged
but i don't plug it, when my semantics hit your nugget
and expose, you know how it goes when it be gritty
when we roll is like we got the key to the city
it won't be pretty for you to challenge,
knock you off balance, better reconsider your talents
You weasel, you better off pumpin diesel
I find it feasable, your days is over frontin evil
Shouting to your people trying to bless your spot
but we don't beleive that cuz CBS tells a lot
on who got shot and who does all the crime
DANGER! And you knew it all the time

*When The East is in the house* *Oh my God*
DANGER!

And when we in the house, ain't no time to act sheisty
come out a spicey to your ass that is pricely
costin', you get baked like Mr. Baustin
Beans in a box, you need more strenght than just locks I rocks
hardcore even when I dress suited
On some business shit my street is deep rooted
What is this shit? Rappers want to blossom, put they all a costume
Thinkin weed buffoon I'll tell you soon
you learn the hard way tims and blunts going Broadway
throught this theater hardrocks is getting witter like virrer
for Alles the East is in your parlor on some proper shit
and it will never be the opposite

*When The East is in the house* *Oh my God*
DANGER!

And when we move on your circuit you better pray to who you worship
That's recommended ass kicks come splendid
Long winded but I don't need my respiratory
to bless my story, you got nothing for me
It's been plotted behind doors they skeemin' up
For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up
Do your stuff finize is going to be limpin' MC's
when I plan my rap you be left handicapped
Sweat! gather because I bring you no jalope
Building all heads that be older than your papi
Pack the wind while PF backspin to the essence,
you get scarred to my presence
