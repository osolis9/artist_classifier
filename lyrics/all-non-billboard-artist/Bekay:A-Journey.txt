A-Journey:Bekay
Half the world is sleeping,
Half the world's awake
Half can hear their hearts beat
Half just hear them break

I am but a traveler, in most every way
Ask me what you want...to know

What a journey it has been
And the end is not in sight
But the stars are out tonight
And they're bound to guide my way

When they're shining on my life
I can see a better day
I won't let the darkness in,
What a journey it has been.

I have been to sorrow
I have been to bliss
Where i'll be tomorrow,
I can only guess

Through the darkest desert
Through the deepest snow,
Forward always forward, i go..

What a journey it has been
And the end is not in sight
But the stars are out tonight
And they're bound to guide my way

When they're shining on my life
I can see a better day
I won't let the darkness in,
What a journey it has been...

Forward, always forward...
Onward, always up...
Catching every drop of hope
In my empty cup

What a journey it has been
And the end is not in sight
But the stars are out tonight
And they're bound to guide my way

When they're shining on my life
I can see a better day
I won't let the darkness in,
What a journey it has been...

What a journey it has been...
