The Double Cup Remix, motherfucker

What you talking about money
(Money bitch I blow it)
Talking about weed
(Shawty come roll it)
Talking about hoes
(Yeah they goin
What about me? Bitch I'm rolling)

I got my double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down
Double cup with my top down

ACE HOOOOOOD!
Let's talk about money
Bitch I get me a whole lot of
Stunting in this ho like a Globe Trotter
Leave red on your shirt like a 49er
I'm sippin' slow with my mind gone
That purple stuff in my styrofoam
I'm too stoned, no angie nigga
Bad bitch and her mouth deliver
Sweet niggas get choppa feelings
I'm getting head with my celling missing
I'm too trippy, I'm to flithy
I'm about bread but don't do jiffy
That new Ferrari cost 2 50
I pull up park but don't play with me
You must be crazy they stay with me
Shooter smoking like 4 20
I smoke good and I fuck better
Me and pussy niggas don't go together
Boy I got balls like a prison cellar
Cop me a watch with a stupid bezzle
My weed loud and my neighboors tripping
I'm a made nigga but I don't wash dishes
Fuck you if you still hating
Your bitch patient, she still waiting

I Am
Double cup with my top down
Two [?], them blocks down
War time no guns down
And I'm sipping on dat H-Town
I'm notorious
All my niggas sell angel dust
All my niggas rock styrofoam
And they doubled up and they have fun
I'm on that remix
I'm selling remix
Hey this that G shit
See them white whips
Hey that's that me shit
I'm bout my V shit
That parade, that white parade
I drop the top on that new Phantom, this city waved
My ghetto ways, my ghetto ways, my ghetto ways, they got me paid
I'm double cup and triple stacking, I got racks for days
And I can't lie, back in the G I used to trap for days
They ask me how I get this money, a 100 ways
I Am

I hold my cup up
(They double cup down, know what the hell I'm dranking)
I let my top down
(They drop the coupe, y'all know what the hell I'm thanking)
Say shout out to them Texas niggas
(Let them know, let them know)
I do this shit for Texas nigga
Young gun of the city got the rock now
Niggas wanna see the shooting star, get shot down
Please don't approach with any [?], bitch I'm Bobby Brown
Got overdone hump like I'm collar man
I been in the stu like it's shining time
I'm back in this bitch and I'm bout to take charge, they thought I was flopping, I gotta find
I pull up in something niggas can't fuck with
The bitch on the front looking gold like a trumpet
The bitch in the passenger, ass like a puppet
My pockets on Kermit, we look like The Muppets
I don't need no soda
I don't need no crutches
To roll with in cup all I need is a tussen
Can't pay for these bitches not part of my buget
You saving these bitches with no control button
Uh, my cup up my top down (double cup and my top down)
I'm well know in that H-Town
From the eastside to the southside to the north
To the southwest to the fair road and the [?] summerpoint, let them know

Talking to a boss bitch
I talk about keys, I talk about packs
I talk about weed, I talk about crack
I talk about Ace, I talk about yacht
I talk about cheese, I don't talk to no rats
I learned from the best
Still go see a nigga while he in the feds
Still run this rap shit while I'm in a dress
These niggas wanna undress me then I'm in that catagory with the rest
The pull up on the breast
Fuck that when it come to this shit, Infamous we the best
He said "T.Foxx kill this shit, get the Smith And Wes"
Blow out the chest
Cavities intestines, wear it on my neck
Once she take her last breath have maggots eat the remains of her brains till it ain't nothin left
And your name on the TEC
When I spit a hot 16 so much cake like
I robbed sweet 16 pussy so clean
And tight like a virgin
So I should been on original bitch
