(Crazy)
Ay, ay
Ay you know me
Ay, it's, it's, it's....it's Doc Holli-muthafuckin'-day
(You don't know me fools?)
A.K.A. Crazy muthafucka now
You know what I'm sayin', ay
I'd like to say um...hello to the muthafuckin' Feds
And the muthafuckin' um....police
And all of them muthafuckas thats tryin' to shut the Iberville down
You can't shut me down when I got this here ya know?

First Verse (Crazy):

When I first got my chopper, I couldn't use it
Now these niggas wanna thug hate me, so I abuse it
Pay your dues nigga that's what, Rodney told me
If a nigga cross my family, his life is what he owe me
I'm the rowdiest nigga here, you better read about it
Ain't no coke, hit Louisiana unless I know about it
Doc Holliday, the name you pigeons jock
Used to call me Crazy in the 'Ville when I was slangin' rocks
Now I tote a Glock
Ready for war
My cousin Tiger got the C-4, blow up your car
I got niggas that be beggin' me, to take a hit
A hundred breathers comin' dressed in black, aw shit
I'm the real don in this bitch, fuck all you other niggas
I be checkin' niggas nuts, while you be countin' figures
If you plan to go to war, then call the coppers
Me and my breathers we was raised totin' choppers

Chorus (Crazy):

When I first got my chopper, I couldn't use it
Now they wanna thug hate me, so I abuse it
Pay your dues nigga that's what, Rodney told me
If you ever cross the family, your life is what you owe me
When I first got my chopper, I couldn't use it
Now these niggas thug hate me, so I abuse it
Pay your dues nigga that's what, Rodney told me
If you ever cross my family, you life is what you owe me

Second Verse (Crazy):

Always claimin' that your money long, down to supply me
If you wanna go to war BITCH, you couldn't find me
But I'll find you, and after shows
Me and my breathers kickin' in your fuckin' door
It's a must that I bust that ass
But you gone see it comin'
Look for the reaper wearin' a hood, you see him runnin'
Nigga, I run shop
That's how we breath
Slangin' everything from 'roin to coke nigga, to weed
Lead up the highway, with the pigs chasin'
I'm a three time loser, I'm not gonna face 'em
Shakin', with my hands up on the trigga if I, die tonight
Remember me nigga
As a heartless muthafucka, King of the block
The breather from New Orleans that been thuggin' like Pac
Ain't no way in Hell muthafuckas, that they could stop us
Even in my grave I'ma still tote my chopper

Chorus

Third Verse (???? + ????):

(????)

Watch where you thug, in the desert storm of slugs
Nigga ain't no love when you fuck with a young thug
Out of blood
I'm huggin' my pistol
Because these niggas out to get you
You knockin' my issue
I got my K ready to split you
I'm leavin' 'em done, and ain't nobody gone be livin'
I'm bustin' for funds, so all your chest gone be rippin'
You test if you want
You get your whole clique funked
Ask the last nigga, he still chillin' in the trunk

(????)

Slug peeler foreala, made nigga
Cuz I tote a nine milli
Chest ripper, hollow point slugs I deliver
My heart's bent cuz I run with those graveyard fillers
Snitch niggas, try that slick shit to get'cha issue
Thug nigga, all about my cream and cake
Fuck them bitches brown nosin' cuz they lame and fake
Perpetrate, you need your fate
Not great from hate
Keep your vest on, but chopper bullets penetrate

Chorus

(Crazy)
We don't care, put your choppers in the muthafuckin' air
We don't care, put your choppers in the muthafuckin' air
We don't care, put your choppers in the muthafuckin' air
We don't care, put your choppers in the muthafuckin' air
Crazy alias Doc Holliday
Breathe with me!
