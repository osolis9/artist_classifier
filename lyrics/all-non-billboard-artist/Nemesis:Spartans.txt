Spartans:Nemesis
As the sun rose high above the land,
Three hundred Spartans prepared to die
For Mother Europe and her sons against
Xerxes Persian hordes
At Thermopylae pass they made their stand,
Defending their ancient Greek homeland
As their countrymen feared the Persian invasion,
The Spartans pledged to be their salvation
Three hundred, Spartans stared death in the face
Three hundred, Spartans fought tooth and nail
We proudly hail!
The strongest and the bravest men in the land,
Of pure Hellenic blood refused to mix
Raised to be soldiers living for the fight,
The foe was known to tremble at their sight
They asked not how many there were,
Only where they could be found
No fear of death, no thought of surrender
They lived for the battle and constant danger
Three hundred, Spartans stared death in the face
Three hundred, Spartans fought tooth and nail
We proudly hail!
Through wave after wave of attack, they stood their ground And even 
surrounded their courage remained A warrior spirit these Spartans did 
evoke Still today in legend they are spoke
Their deaths avenged by the Spartans as plateau
The memory lives on throughout our battles
Three hundred, Spartans stared death in the face
Three hundred, Spartans fought tooth and nail
Three hundred, in defense of our race
Three hundred Spartans, we proudly hail!
