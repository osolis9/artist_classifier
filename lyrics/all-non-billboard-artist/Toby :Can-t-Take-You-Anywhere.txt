Can-t-Take-You-Anywhere:Toby 
You've been a part of my life for so very long
It's hard for me to believe sometimes that you're really gone
I tuck your memory away in that special hiding place
Hoping no one could tell by the look on my face

That you're still in my heart, always on my mind
Part of my everyday
Like just last night, I went out for a bite
I tried to have fun with all of my might

But even the laughter, it wasn't much of a break
'Cause right in the middle of my salad and steak
Bobby Joe walked in with a couple of friends
And said, "Hey, have you heard from her at all man
Like where's she been?"

And it struck a nerve and it hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me

But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you coming back again
I swear, I can't take you anywhere

So I left all alone, just headed back home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister
And one from an old friend

He said, "I drove by your house tonight, dude
But you weren't in
Just checking up on you, boy, I hope you're doing alright
Oh, by the way, man, I seen her last nightâ€

And it struck a nerve and it hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me

But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you coming back again
I swear, I can't take you anywhere

I swear, I can't take you
Just can't take you
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
I can't take you anywhere
