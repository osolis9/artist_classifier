So I'm sittin' at the table throwing fits at my mother
I want my own box I don't wanna split with my brother
The one thing I hated to admit he discovered,
Was certain cereals would make the milk different colors.
If you took away my cereal, you heard screams.
I liked Kaboom 'cause it always made my poo turn green.
I'd make a scene in the store and start to act disobedient
If sugar didn't come first in the ingredients
Made my mom buy me some no matter what it costed
The best ones started with the same word (frosted)
'Cause if it ain't sugary it ain't no good
I hate health-food cereals; it tastes like wood.

My favorite kind was made my Mineral Gills
Big spoon, big bowl, I got minimal spills
I ain't finished the box yet, in a minute I will.
While I'm getting my cartoon and kung-fu cinema thrills.
I be watching Master Killer chompin' Zilla Vanilla,
Maybe Grrr-Ape, that's the one that had the purple gorilla.
I crushed chunks of Hunch Munch watched the dudes doin' stunt jumps
left it in the milk too long, turned into lump-clumps
I remember once I saw some sh that was scary,
Couldn't see it in the milk, they called it Invisi-Berry.
24/7 at my house, breakfast is served
I'ma keep eatin' cereal 'til it gets on your nerves!

The game of findin' toy surprises, gimme the crown
Listen up, here and now, I'ma tell you my secret how
First you shake the whole thing just a little to hear the sound
Pop open the top of the box where the seal is found.
Pull the glue off the side of the bag and peel it down.
If it's stuck, hold the box sideways and squeeze it 'round.
See it now? If not hope that your parents don't see you plow through the box with your hands up to your elbow feelin' around.
I'm feeling proud now that I know that it's found;
Toy searchin' mission accomplished, it's over for now.
So I pour around a quarter pound mound and go to town,
With the bowl to my mouth like a hound, it's goin' down.
No slowin' down, now you know I'm throwin' down,
Eatin' rainbow colors you can't even find over the clouds.
You're feeling over fed, but it ain't all done
'Til you tip the box over your head and drank the crumbs.
