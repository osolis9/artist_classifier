New-Girl:3OH!3
New girl – I really need your body right now

We always rockin the freshest gear
Letter jacket like freshman year
Leather jacket like – don’t come near
We smokin in the bathroom – graffiti on the mirror
There she was
Walking down the hall
High heels, blonde hair, 6-foot tall
“Oh yeah,” they cat-call
Football jocks with their jaws on the floor
“Hey little lady, I don’t know about them jockers”
Is what I wrote in a note on her locker
Not much of a talker, but you know how I do, girl
Just another guy who’s obsessed with the new girl

New girl – can I get your number?
New girl – I wanna get to know you
New girl – cause I really need your body right now

Hop in the room – back to back
She wasn’t ready for my rap attack
We lookin fly girl – so relax
Yo DJ – stop the track…
Yo girl – how you doin?
You feelin good?
Yeah me too
You lookin fine – so fine
Gonna make you mine – yeah I got to
You don’t know?
Here’s the truth:
New Jack playin from the DJ booth
New in town?
Here’s the truth:
Sean sing it to her nice and smooth

New girl – can I get your number?
New girl – I wanna get to know you
New girl – cause I really need your body right now

New girl – you know you seem so cool, girl
I see you all around school, girl
Will you be my new girl?
New girl – you should ditch that fool, girl
You know that guy’s a tool, girl
You could be my new girl

New girl – can I get your number?
New girl – I wanna get to know you
New girl – cause I really need your body right now
