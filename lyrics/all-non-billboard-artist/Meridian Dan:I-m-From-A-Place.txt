I-m-From-A-Place:Meridian Dan
Hook;
I'm from a place where man do crime
From a bit where man buss case
From an ends where man don't care what your name is
Us man don't watch face
I'm from the hood I spray grime
In love with the kick and bass
Some can't understand the bars I spray on the tune
They can't keep up with the pace
I'm from a place where man do crime
From a part you think is rough
From a bit where kids wanna be like Jay Z 
Or Biggie and Puff
From the ends that get no love
When a lot of the kids have heart
Ambitions and dreams
But don't have a chance

Verse 1;
I know that I'm not from Compton
But my road ain't like Brompton
So when I went for my job interview
I realised I had a problem
Cos I never went to Eton
The address on my CV's Tottenham
But is that a reason 
To put me in a box like Bronson
Man all wanna be like Branson
And drink Dom PÃ©rignon not Lanson
Like N-Dubz from Camdem
I wanna share success with the mandem
Like the man that know about Bobby and Bo 
And man that know about Samson
For them kind of man I make room in the phantom
Not some dudes that I met at Random

Verse 2;
I'm from a place where making money is risky
Man roll with Po like Dipsy
Some lick shots all day but you can't make p
When I knows it 2.50
I don't know how the drugs and guns get here
Trust me it's a mystery
Man are in the mob like the goons in Sicily
Cold ass men in the iceberg history
Still I want to be successful
A hard knock life is stressful
You just wanna look fly in your rental
You wanna be fly drink Red Bull
I'm on a grown up ting
As strong as on Ox but gentle
Any of you lot violate me
Man a go man a go man a go mental

Verse 3;
I'm from a place where kids have dreams
But don't know the ways or means
To put things together so it all makes sense
Like two bits of toast and beans
They've seen more drama than the stage
These kids act too big for their age
They just wanna get paid
Not by working for miniumum wage
If they could see a clear path in front
And get a chunk at the end of the month
I'm from the street it's not a hunch
These kids don't wanna deal in punk
These are the kids that sum four deen
Cos there wearing a hood and jeans
Some of these kids are just fourteen
And it fucks with their self-esteem
