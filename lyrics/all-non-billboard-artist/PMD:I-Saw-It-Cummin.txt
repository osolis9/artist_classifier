Verse 1:
Grab ya head nigga, start bobbin it, the underground's
Bein shook down PMDs robbin it, so crack all gold yeah,
And spark the phillie blunts, im chumpin niggaz down
Takin minds on a manhunt (po-po kid), don't get caught
Up in the gunsmoke, it's rap artin season, and im blastin
Niggaz who show-off, with that pretty-boy R&B; rap, back
With a hiphop track, say that, cause that's whack, and
Niggaz aint trying to hear that, can't get sidetracked
So what's the impact, to get the bozack, and mind yo
Beeswax, still in the game with somethin Jane.

Chorus--
Went solo on that ass when i feel the fame
(I saw it cummin, that's why i went solo)

Verse 2:
What's this? another funky hit from the squad kid? no time
For comebacks black, time to run shit, so pass that
Microphone, plug it into the soundboard, scratch cuts the
Wax, chop it like a chainsaw, so who's callin my name?
Been doin this since 87' cause this is my thing, can't
Forget Jane, haircut, like Anita Baker, never seen no
One faker, to make the mistake-a, tryin to push up
On a brother, who brainstorms, you know i'm physco crazy
Like that man nor--man bates, wait, excuse me for the
(?) that makes me hesitate, no time to translate, gotta
Go kid, time to motivate, back to the blackzone, 'cause
There's no thing.

Chorus
X5

Verse 3:
There's somethin with all these corny niggaz, makin
Faces, on my TV screen, can't shoot this dude, cause if
I do it makes 19, no time for the crime scene, grab my
Bozack, and my mic, time to beam, back to the underground
Hold more beat-downs, drop some I'll shit like this, for
The niggaz to leave round town HARDCORE, hittin switches
In the '6-4, 3 foot motion, or the benz with the 4-door
Troopin past the local spot, niggaz wanna act up, and
Niggaz catch the speedknot, trying to promote viloence,
But that's the way it is, the code of the ghetto aint got
Nothin to do with showbiz, remember that, yea, still
Bustin brains, YEA

Chorus
X4

Hit squad in the house, PMD records in effect
24-hour representin
Went solo on that ass when i feel the fame
Big shot out to KRS-one
Went solo on that ass when i feel the fame
