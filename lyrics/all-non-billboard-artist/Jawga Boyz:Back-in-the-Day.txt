and did things that they never said i could
i used to make prank calls back in the day

and ill always be that kid y'all
grew up out in jackson county jefferson n river road is where ya found me
yah we used to ride up n down that road like we owned it cuz we really did back then
n my friends used ta stop bye all the time if they see me in the yard out side
never had a reason really just came to kick it n talk about how the cops gave us tickets
i miss it everybody does i guess cuz there was less stress in the life i left
n now people wanna know more about me cuz they c me on tv
i used to trade baseball cards back in the day
camp out in the back yard back in the day
cut a few trails in the woods back in the day
and did things that they never said i could
i used to make prank calls back in the day
try to race my dogs back in the day
play tackel football back in the day
and ill always be that kid y'all
17 years old i graduated high school as a young soul
but still lived at home mineaswell of been kicked out
cuz high school never taught me about
how this world is gonna step all over your face
and crush every dream that you try to put in place
they need to teach a new class and call it how the real world is gonna kick your ass
and then maybe i coulda been more prepared and awear that everyday life ain't fair
cuz their was a time when i didnt even know that life was slow yah
when i used to trade baseball cards back in the day
camp out in the back yard back in the day
cut a few trails in the woods back in the day
and did things that they never said i could
i used to make prank calls back in the day
try to race my dogs back in the day
play tackel football back in the day
and ill always be that kid y'all
yea everythings changed
my life as a kid is gone in the wind
n most of my friends never seen em again
n that street that i used to live on is dead
i still visit their n drive threw real slow
thinkin bout my grandma livin up the road
fixin me n all my friends icecream cones
n nobody had a damn cell phone
we could do what we wanted n stay out late
didnt have to worrie like kids do today
used to ride my bike all over the place makin noise on the spokes with styrophome plates
yea it was all good
jackson county treated me good to
i still press rewind in my mind n go back
when i used to trade baseball cards back in the day
camp out in the back yard back in the day
cut a few trails in the woods back in the day
and did things that they never said i could
i used to make prank calls back in the day
try to race my dogs back in the day
play tackel football back in the day
and ill always be that kid y'all
