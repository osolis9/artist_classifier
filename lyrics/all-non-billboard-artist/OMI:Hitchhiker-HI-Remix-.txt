Hitchhiker-HI-Remix-:OMI
All my life I spent chasing the pretty lights
And how they shine, but they never kept me warm
How many times did I once let love come and go?
Was it my pride that made me run so far?

Was it your voice that called me when I was at my low?
Was it your love that warmed me? I guess tonight I'll know

Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhicker 'til I found you
I found a home I never wanna leave
Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhicker this what I choose
I found a home I never wanna leave
in my heart, I was a hitchhicker, hitchhicker
in my heart, I was a hitchhicker, hitchhicker 'til I found you

Am I too messed up or is there time for me to change?
Where was my love when I needed it the most?
But then you showed up, for the first time you heard me say
"Can I stay? Can I stay a little longer with you?"

Was it your voice that called me when I was at my low?
Was it your love that warmed me? I guess tonight I'll know

Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhicker 'til I found you
I found a home I never wanna leave
Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhicker this what I choose
I found a home I never wanna leave
in my heart, I was a hitchhicker, hitchhicker
in my heart, I was a hitchhicker, hitchhicker 'til I found you
