Saying-Goodbye:Verse
You're leaving me and I DON'T KNOW WHY
All I know is that I'm saying goodbye
I wished to god it would be okay
But I guess life doesn't go that way
A pain that's impossible to describe
A loss I wish I never had to feel
Everytime I see your face
It tears me up inside to think
That your life is at it's end
Everytime I see your face
It tears me up inside to think
That you are dying inside
I wished we didn't have to
SAY GOODBYE
SAY GOODBYE
I wish we didn't have to
SAY GOODBYE
SAY GOODBYE
You're leaving me and I don't know why
I fight so hard to hold back tears in my eyes
The life I remember has long passed away
All that is left are memories
I HOLD SO CLOSE TO ME
SAY GOODBYE...
SAY GOODBYE
