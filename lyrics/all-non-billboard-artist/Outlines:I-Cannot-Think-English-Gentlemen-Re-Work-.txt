I-Cannot-Think-English-Gentlemen-Re-Work-:Outlines
White boy soul call it rock and roll
If it glitters it must be gold
Conference calls are put on hold
Let's burn together and lose control
You keep me hungry while you eat me alive
With you daggers and your hungry knives
You keep me thirsty while you drink me alive
Drink the blood of my nine to five
And i know
There must be a link between you and the ink
That i use and abuse until i cannot think
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (i cannot think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (how can i think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (i cannot think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (how can i think)
...
White boy soul call it new or old
Pocket aces, you'd better fold
The greatest story that's never been told
Let's burn together as we lose control
You keep me hungry while you eat me alive
With you daggers and your hungry knives
You keep me thirsty while you drink me alive
Drink the blood of my hundredth wife
And i know
There must be a link between you and the ink
That i use and abuse until i cannot think
Think
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (i cannot think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (how can i think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (i cannot think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (how can i think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (i cannot think)
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (i cannot think)
Burnin' burnin' with your desire.

(lose control) (i cannot think).
