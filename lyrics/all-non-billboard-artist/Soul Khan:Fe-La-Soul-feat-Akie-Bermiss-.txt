Fe-La-Soul-feat-Akie-Bermiss-:Soul Khan
They got my melatonin hella open, y'all, I'm seeping on 'em
But I'm so beyond that next shit, I'm quantum leaping on 'em
And they're lambs to the slaughter, so I gotta feast upon 'em
But J57 told me not to speak upon 'em
Well, gotta get your, gotta get your, gotta get your bars up
I connect that live electric shit that lit the stars up
Y'all just bosses, I'm walking with a halo
The way they're politicking got my mama sick, it's shameful
This anglo's slick as a raincoat, Get vehicular mangled
If you think you can range rove with
This con queso-getter from Grayskull
That delivers the fuego to incinerate them same old cliques
They let the flood gates open, I don't like the result
And I ain't concerned with swagger, homie, I'm an adult
So fuck a photo op if you're still here for the music
And holler at your man that be chilling with the chewstick
And the people sing
Can't you hear 'em sing?
And they all sing
So let's all sing
And the people sing
Can't you hear 'em sing?
And they all sing
So let's all sing
Mama-se, mama-sa, mama-ku-suck on my dick
If you think that I ain't that sick
You wanna clap that gauge? Money act your age
I got a massive range like I'm satchel paige
I'm living proof that even if you sacrifice
You only get a lil' dap as your asking price
And seems like the ink dried all too fast
You signed on that line but all you ass
Y'all some borderline barnacles, welcome to the chronicles
So old school that my molecules got monocles
Fine women caught a few, ice dripping? Nada. You
Ain't built nothing but a little lego block or two
Ain't a person I can shoot, that was a child once
Who never got a chance cause he ran with the wild ones
Rather sip a 22 than throw a clip in 22
Cause going to a funeral ain't really nothing fun to do
