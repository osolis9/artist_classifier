Wow:Famous Dex
Hold up wait, turn me up sis
Hold up wait, my phone wait, wait
Sci Fi on the beat
Oh Man God Damn

Red head like Matt Hardy
Fuck your lil bitch she was horny
Yeah I'm riding on the harley
I'm tatted up on my body

I swear to God man, I got a shotty
You run up on me and catch a body
A matter fact I got a 30
Oh shit, it's shooting Curry
Back in the days I was broke
Man I was tryna steal some Coke
Jugging nigga sellin' soap
Anything to get that dough
Now a nigga sellin' out at shows
Fucking bitches all in my shows
Alexander McQueen, clean my clothes
Alexander McQueen, clean my toes
All this blue cheese on me
Can't fuck with niggas, they phony
Playing bitches just like Sony
Or run up on me, turn into balongna
Oh yeah, all I know is money
I swear to God, I ain't no dummy
Fat daddy, yah duh dummy
We was known for getting money
Poppin' on pills like junkies
Sippin' on lean ain't funny
All these bitches they annoying me
And diamonds on me, it's a surgery
Baby girl said she heard of me
And baby girl get away from me
And yeah, you can't have my baby
I know you heard I was crazy
Bitch I make a nigga do a flip flop
Keep talking shit, get your shit smashed
I ain't with the twitter beef
And you can meet me in the streets

Red head like Matt Hardy
Fuck your lil bitch she was horny
Yeah I'm riding on the harley
I'm tatted up on my body
