Columbus-Or-Bust:Greenhouse Effect
[Intro:]
Keep it movin'. Weightless*
Keep it live. Columbus, Ohio. Don't stop, don't stop
Campus legends. Ohio State. Keep it movin'. To all the Buckeyes
Printmatic. Like this

[Verse 1: ~Blueprint~]
I can't believe the weak rhymes, I see get credit
Sounds like some of my shit before I make edits
Fuck makin' it off of idiots that don't get it
And writers who don't understand my life and how I live it
If I said it, I meant it
Unless I've been drinkin' and I'm talkin' to a chicken
But even then I don't act different
Because I don't gotta tell lies to have her let me hit it
You know the lo-cal
South Phil resident
My people pump crack right in front of their parents
A lot of fake dudes died tryin' to be real niggas
I don't have to rap about the streets cause it's a given
My people said, "Al, you gotta stay off the block.
Cause you get good grades and your jumper is hot."
So I did the knowledge
Went to college
Got a job and then quit that shit
Now I'm back to where I started
Be careful bout what you copy off television
You might C Walk your way into an ass whippin'
Out here it's just fashion
It's real out west
You can wear black and white when you laid to rest
I'm from the O state, no pro football teams
The only thing we only hate is The Wolverines
Shit for them?
Get slapped and you won't do a thing
But mumble under your breath and look at me mean
You punk bitch

[Manifes: {*talking*}]
Whatever happened to motherfuckers gettin' booed off stage man?
Throwin'-throwin' like, tomatoes at cats
We gotta bring it back to them days.
We gonna try to come up as the new New York
On some ole' Apollo shit
And if you wack, and you on stage you gettin' yanked off
Mic cords is gettin' unplugged and all of that. Two thousand and live

[Verse 2: ~Blueprint~]
Uh ha,
See, inside I hear a voice
Tellin' me to stay patient and stand strong
You're destined for greatness
But sometimes
It's so hard to take it
I feel like Ruben Studdard in a world full of Clay Atkins
My heroes started out on some real shit
Got they feet in the door...
Then switched it
But tellin' me to switch it up to make riches?
That's like askin' Picasso to paint stick figures
See
I don't care about rap that much
And in general
I think most of it sucks
But at least I can do the type of music I want
Because I'm always bein' me I don't gotta front
What?
To many guys guys are preoccupied with sounds...scan
But me
I'm worried about my sound...man
And how he got my beats soundin'
We need a lot more bass
So it's poundin'
Slap you in your bumbarasta
My comp got nada
Even my interviews are hotta
I ? man is headed
Cause he told me to drop science, so I had to dead it
Now I drop English and math until you get it
My B-sides and guest appearances are extra credit
I even teach at night for no extra fee
Shit, you paid for the lesson
