Herbaholics:Phi-Life Cypher
[Si Philli]
Listen, I be the herbaholic, specializing in hydrophonics
I'm saving the sickest niggas with my hydrophonic tonics (sound of throwing up)
Super like sonics, floating like the Spanish armada,
I'm ready to spit the kick about the missing marijuana
It's getting harder, to acquire what I desire
Due to the politicians wanna stop me getting higher (oi!)
Causing the peoples minds with their propaganda scams
And claiming my marijuana's gonna make my life a sham
Because a cultivator, putting my seeds inside the propagator
Graduating my hydrophonics major
Studying marijuana to a scientific stage
And making it clear for people that's living with grief or rage
Alcohol causes kidney damage and liver sorosis (uh?)
Marijuana's been known with curing multiple Schlorosis (ok, I'm listening)
My diagnosis, is that it doesn't cause psychosis
Only some people suffer with a case of halitosis (urrrhhghuuur)
I know this, isn't what you've been taught by the media
It's time for you to listen to knowledge that I be feeding ya (shhh)
In '83 Ronald Reagan he turned to parakat
And started on spraying my holy herbs with some araquat (man)
They was planning on killing me for puffing herbs
Said that if I died then it was what that I deserved (he deserves that you know)
It's absurd, we can buy alcohol in any off license
Then walk around paralytic and cause violence (Oi! Ohoh!)
Acting like tyrants, beating up on family members (ahh!)
Waking up in the morning and we cant even remember (yo, what happened)
Yo this is fact that I've written
Alcohol cause seventy-five percent of the violence there be in Britain
I'm spitting, lyrical fact to the Jack Straw
Telling him that it's wise that he legalize the draw (Bo!)
With metaphors and medical evidence
Showing him that marijuana be burning from the mansions to the tenements

[Life]
A ganja smoker, herb cultivator, the world champion spliff maker
Build a ziggy so big I use a hundred and fifty-two packets of rizla paper
I sparked it up in the U.K you could smell the vapors in Jamaica
Slam-dunked a hole in my brain like Kobe Bryant playing for the Lakers
I process hydrophonic data, smoke sensamelia by the acre
It never affects my breathing my lungs are exercise like Mr. Motivator
Getting stoned on a rizla cone inside of a skyscraper
I'd rather be a herbaholic than an alcoholic narcotic class-a drug taker
Listen to my words, ganja is natural herb grown for the earth
It used to be associated with Rastafarians who praised Haile Selassie at the first
It's not only smoked by vegetarian Rastafarians
It's smoked by the Aries Taurus Gemini Cancers Leos Virgos, Sagittariuns
Librans Scorpions Capricorns Pisces and the Aquarians
Everyone in the Zodiac I'm sure they're not all black and Rastafarians
People have been smoking herb since the earth's first days
It grows on Solomon's grave
Even when Jesus was crucified you could see his eyes were glazed

[Si Philli]
Herb helps me concentrate meditate leaves my body and mind in a healthy state
Giving me brainwaves, helping my third eye to navigate
Ganja be loving me liking ganja I smoke at a high rate killing the pyrates
Herbaholic bionic chronic I smoke before I flip my mind state
I'm a freestyler, translate into all languages they're understanding this
Through the four corners of the earth I spread my word like an evangelist
The disappearing cannabis you can't handle this Mr. Nice smoke
Make you feel dizzy like someone suffering from vertigo on a tightrope
How the fuck you think that angels sound angelic reaching for the high notes?
Cos in the heaven they're getting high cos up in the sky is where I blow my smoke
Take a toke and get shocked like an electric volt two thousand megawatts
-- test this and I'll leave you breathless
I blaze purple haze from skunk trees, any weeds from many countries
Smoke shit from the Amazon jungle, trees grown from the Outer Hebrides
I defy laws of gravity while flying to another galaxy
Smoking Martian weed it gave me hallucinogenic alien fantasies
I got turquoise weed from Pluto with yellow dots in it
So addictive anyone who smokes it swears blind that I put rocks in it
I got an aphrodisiac weed from Venus, sniffing a penis (Wooooh!)
Getting your girl to start to pirouette on your dick like ballerinas (baby!)
You all think radiation gave the X-men their super powers
But how can you really tell if they got it from smoking super skunk buds and flowers

Sample: Ahhh! You like that weed I was smoking? Ahhh! That weeds for me!

- Weed that put the hump in the camels back

Ahhh! Weed food

put the boogie-woogie in your brain, drive you insane

Ahhh!

Scratching: Yo now what you gonna do? Puff the Buddha bless

Sample: Hey man I've got some grass! (yeah!)
Oh my god, I aint got no papers (ahhhhhh)
Wait a minute I've got some papers! (yeah!)
Ahhh the stores closed, (ahhhhhh)
But I got a pipe! (yeah!)
But we aint got no matches (ahhhhh)
I've got some grass! (yeah!)
but I'm busted
