Suck a nigga dick chopped and screwed though

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Bad bitch
Whistle while you twerk on that dick
That's it
Make it nasty
All that shit
Classy, in the street
But freaky in the bedroom
Bad ho
Whistle while you twerk
And don't miss a note

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]

She got off, the paper pilin'
Hoes mad tight

Lickin' her lips just like she give the mean marvelous
Ass clappin' on that green carpet

Slow grindin', got a nigga brick

Don't tell no lie
