Known to make [?] in your mouth
Open up the kitchen door you're going south of
Fixing OJ and cereal in your boyfriend's house, shit
Had you on my ankle bracelet & found you

Bathroom jerks & fuck in the culdesac
While your mothers lips spaghetti sauce on my back
How are you?

Take a number two in your mouth slow what it do
Nasty, my watch so classy, knees so ashy, my hair so swaggy
Dub you for white tard bitch named Maggie
She was sorta fucked, but she fucked quite smashing
Dashing, charming, ass white Charmin
And all won't see your bitch ass in the morning because your..

We can watch the Matrix as long as you're naked
Here bitch take this roofie, feeling a little goody
Pass out and I'm feeling on your booty
Kells, filling up your well. Love how that smells
While I'm eating eggs off your forehead
While you give me forehead, board, bed broken
Choking on the east vibes

Stop crying. You're a big girl now
No more pampers, tell em me and you live up in the hampers
