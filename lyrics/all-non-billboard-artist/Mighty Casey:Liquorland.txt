Liquorland:Mighty Casey
[Chorus]
Liquorland is a real nice place
Now you might wanna visit but you don't wanna stay
'Cuz if you stay the alcohol might take you under
And champagne dreams ...?

Pass the gin and tonic I'm a straight up alchoholic
'Cuz I drink a lot of beer and yo I smoke a lot of chronic
Now I drink the Old English while my speech is slurred
And I drink the Everclear but my vision's still blurred
I try to find religion started drinking St. Ides
And I took a night train 'cuz I needed a ride
I try to get molenko? gave my girl Spanish Fly
But now I chill with Captain Morgan and a pack of Colt 45
I got a pet King Cobra and a pet Mad Dog
Budweiser taste like water so I killed the tree frog
And I'm chillin' always jokin', sippin' rum and coke an'
And if I ain't drinkin' then you best believe I'm smokin'
I'm only 23 but yo I'll never ever grow up
And I'm that crazy ass rapper drinkin' liquor 'til I throw up
On the floor then go to the store and get some more
A 40 couldn't do it so I got a 64
So I got a little bent and I hopped up in the Nova
But the police pulled me over and said "Brother, is you sober?"
I looked him in the eye with a hand on my drink
let out a fat burp and said "Man, what you think?"
The cop tried to make a brother walk in a line
So I threw him on the floor and I walked on his spine
Then I kicked him in the chest and I dipped up in the car car
Put the pedal to the medal I drink more vodka then a rock star
Liquor got me feel like I'm 'bout to explode
And I'm switchin' four lanes on a one lane road
[Yeah I tried to quit liquor a while back
But my mother always told me "Quitters are losers"
And I ain't no loser]

[Chorus]

And I'm highly educated, quite sophisticated
Never been incarcerated still I stay intoxicated
And now I know the reason why I act this way
Sippin' alize on the way to AA
And if I can't find a liquor then I won't be disappointed
I'll just smoke a coupla spliffs and act like I'm double jointed
I'm an Absolut menace when I'm sippin on a Smirnoff
Put up like Holyfield when Tyson bit his ear off
I drink to remember and I drink to forget
I curse worse than a sailor with a case of Tourrets
I spend a lot of time with Jim Beam and Jacky Daniels
And piss on more streets than Pit Bulls on Cocker Spaniels
Catch me sippin' on a liquor thats harder than a lead pipe
I'm proud to be Jamaican so I'm sippin crazy Red Stripe
Looking for Mighty Casey? Well I ain't hard to reach
I'm with a sexy Margarita havin' Sex on the Beach
On the road doin' 50 sippin 151
And when I ran out of gas I start run and I run
I hit the bar wreck like the witness in a car chase
And take more shots than Pacino did in Scarface
And before the night's over I have a couple more drinks
I got knocked out in 90 seconds like that brother Leon Spinks
[Haha know what I'm sayin'? I'm a winner right here and I won
Know where I'm goin? I'm going to Liquorland
