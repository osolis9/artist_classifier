Beautiful-EP-:Group 1 Crew
La, la, oh, oh, oh, oh*
Ay, yo, B, yeah
Let these people know what beautiful really means

I've been thinking 'bout the way I see myself and I
Just can't understand why I say
All those hurtful things about myself, my insecurities
They don't seem to just go away

And it's hard for me to understand you loving me
Through every mistake that I make
I'm so glad that you will never leave, keep reminding me
How you see me every day that I wake

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, uh, oh, uh, oh
I'm so beautiful, so natural, not typical
I'm so beautiful, there's nobody else made like me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me

Yes, you are, yes, you are, yes, you are
Yes, you are, yes, you are, yes, you are

I love the way you made my smile 'cause it fits my face
It's so wonderful, unbelievable
And every color in my eye is just the perfect shade
It's so incredible, indescribable

Now you may think I'm not a perfect size or overweight
But I'm huggable, oh, so, lovable
Let's put away our silly thoughts and fall in love with life
'Cause there's so many reasons for you to smile

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, uh, oh, uh, oh
I'm so beautiful, so natural, not typical
I'm so beautiful, there's nobody else made like me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me

That's me, I like a girl who got some confidence
Uncommon but with common sense
Quick to help her mama with the groceries and condiments
Doesn't live fast and loves life and gives compliments
Someone who I can ask about life and knows what time it is

Never late to meet me even though I am
Give her some sorry excuse but she always understands
She can take me in some sports, basketball was her thang
But at night she throws some heels on and her love is still the same

Don't need a cover girl or Maybelline or maybe I lean
A 'lil closer to the side of viewing her as a queen
And overthrows my life with the sense of humor she brings
I'd give my life away to hear her sing, to hear her sing

I'm so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, uh, oh, uh, oh
(I'm so beautiful)
I'm so beautiful, so natural, not typical
I'm so beautiful, there's nobody else made like me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me
I'm so B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L, that's me

(Beautiful)
I'm so beautiful
(Beautiful)
You're so beautiful
(Beautiful)
Woah, woah, ooh
(Beautiful)

This goes out to all my ladies out there
You're beautiful
So don't be afraid to be you
Let your hair down, put your smile on

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Yeah, hmm
