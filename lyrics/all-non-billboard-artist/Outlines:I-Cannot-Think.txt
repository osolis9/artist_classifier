I-Cannot-Think:Outlines
White boy soul call it rock and roll, 
If it glitters it must be gold, 
Conference calls are put on hold 
Let's burn together and lose control. 

You keep me hungry while you eat me alive, 
With you daggers and your hungry knives 
You keep keep me thirsty while you drink me alive. 
Drink the blood of my nine to five and I know 
There must be a link between you and the ink 
That I use and abuse until I cannot think. 

I keep my hopes in a distant fire (I cannot think) 
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (I cannot think) 
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (I cannot think) 
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (How can I think?) 

White boy soul call it new or old. 
Pocket aces, you'd better fold, 
The greatest story that's never been told 
Let's burn together as we loose control. 

You keep me hungry while you eat me alive, 
With you daggers and your hungry knives 
You keep keep me thirsty while you drink me alive 
Drink the blood of my hundredth wife and I know 
There must be a link between you and the ink 
That I use and abuse until I cannot think 
Think, think, think, think, think, think
Think, think, think, think, think, think
How can I think? 

I keep my hopes in a distant fire (I cannot think) 
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (I cannot think) 
I keep my hopes in a distant fire (I cannot think) 
Burnin' burnin' with your desire (How can I think?) 

I cannot think
I cannot think
I cannot think
How can I think? 

I cannot think
