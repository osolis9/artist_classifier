Live-and-Die-for-Hip-Hop-:Kris Kross
One two one two unhhh
one two one two
mic check one two one two
(MacDaddy)
I devoted my whole life
to rockin' mics
Getting crowds lifted
Put my pants on backwards
cuz i wanted to be different
I keeps em with a crease
tom peeps bum to nucci
House full of hunnies sportin' gucci
Cuttin' coochie
I'm the man girlfriend
Luxury I swim
Macadocious to the most
Brown sex and slim
State of uptrends
Known for making dividends
and millions of people jump jump jump jump
(Da Brat)
Now who choose to be the next nigga to step
Get deleted by death
Undefeated ain't no thang to put that body to rest
Chest filled with smoke
Yokin' niggas up by the collar
Follow me cuz my dollars makin' more cents than common
Robbin' you for yo money and yo diamonds
Endangerin' yo species
More than a women like the bee gees
No remorse
Steady smokin' plenty grass
Let it go
And let Da Brat commence to be the baddest hoe
Well nigga roll me a mic
and let me smoke til I'm high
If you ever seen me rock
Then you know that I-
Live and die foe the thangs I do
Slang I Use
Breakin' down mics
And destroyin' ya crew
(DaddyMac)
Nothin' but a C big party
(twelve until)
See I'm the Daddy of the Mac
and at the top of the world
I chill keep it real
My feela' work consists of that
(a thuggish ass niggas sayin' way to keep 'em pissed)
My life
I wouldn't trade it to me it's nun better
Wakin' up hen I wanna sportin' Jay-Boogie Leather
Autographs
(bubble baths five star hotels)
Rollin' wit' a clique
Supa thick and everybody gettin' well
(Mr. Black)
Take off the safety
Face me
Gun powder chowder for real
The last nigga figga to ever make it off the hill
But still
Rhymes rock like Cope the smoke
And I'm in effect
Wit' a tech that got a infa-red scope
Smackin' those actin'
Tough as Tinactin
Fall up in yo hood
Increase yo brain with tha mack 10
Stacked N's 17s on the Benz
And burn up on my thigh
In case these niggas won die
(Jermaine Dupri)
I want ya to feel me
My whole thang is to get inside yo body
I run game like my name was John Gotti
Hittin' hookshots like Vlade
And niggas around my way call me little Liberace
A lady lover
Like no other
And I be
Lethal with my weapon so they call me Danny Glover
Now who keep it hot
(We do)
See So So Deaf ain't nuthin' but a fool ass crew
