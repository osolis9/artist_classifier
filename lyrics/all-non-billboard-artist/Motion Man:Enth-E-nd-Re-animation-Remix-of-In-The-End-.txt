Enth E nd (Re-animation Remix of 'In The End')
Eh yo
When this fist started off it was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was Kutmasta Kurt with the remix

One thing 
I don't know why
It deosn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know
Time was just slippin away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Whatched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo in the clock rythm 
And my face
And I know I didn't look out below 
When I watched the time go right out the window
Tryin to grab hold
Tryin not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end no matter what I pretend the 
journy is more importent then the end or the start
And what it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when 

I tried so hard
And got so far 
But in the end, it deosn't even matter
I had to fall to loose it all
But in the end it deosn't even matter

A yo one thing
I don't know why
It deosn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
Ha, so socialize
Like the  host of the party
I spoke shade the name on contact
Party the toast strong format 
North east south west coast
I'm standing at the window
No oppertunity to mindle
I tried to sold up
You weakin your system and be thrown up
I brought you back your thangs 
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Dude always seemed to make it worth it
A pigskin I never nurf it
You fell never the pleather real bringin the pleasure  
By any means 
It means I'm leaving your team
The teenages and the scenes and 

I tried so hard
And got so far 
But in the end, it deosn't even matter
I had to fall to loose it all
But in the end it deosn't even matter

One thing
I dont know how 
It deosn't even matter when you look at it now
Cause when I designed this rhyme 
I was scared of it all
Scared to fall
Hadn't even tried to crawl
When I was forced to run
With you mocking me
Stopping me
Backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watched the clock stop chalk full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail 
Every single word you sputter just to get your peace
But it really deosn't matter to me

Cause from the start to the end 
No matter what I pretend 
the journy's more importent then the end or the start
And what it really meant to me 
will eventually be a memory of a time when 

I tried so hard
And got so far 
But in the end, it deosn't even matter
I had to fall to loose it all
But in the end it deosn't even matter

In the end
