Stuck On You
(Rose Tattoo)
My babe said she won't be home tonight
Says she's got a lover well...that's alright
Hey little schoolgirl, won't you come home with me
We'll drink some Coca Cola, and watch my color t.v.

Yeah, sing it ??

Hey babe I'm stuck on you
Hey babe I'm stuck like glue
Hey babe you know I'm stuck on you stuck on you
Like a Rose Tattoo

I had a colored parrot, but it made me cry
I just forgot to feed it, and the little bugger died
I had a fish named Sam, he lived in bowl
I heated up the water, so he wouldn't get cold

Now he's gone, now he's gone

Hey babe I'm stuck on you
And hey babe I'm stuck like glue
Hey babe I'm stuck on you stuck on you
Like a Rose Tattoo...yeah, yeah yeah
