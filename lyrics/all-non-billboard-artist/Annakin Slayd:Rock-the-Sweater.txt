Rock-the-Sweater:Annakin Slayd
We rock the sweater
We rock it proud
Rock like Carrier
We rock it loud
Throw on that C-H Go
And let the whole world know
Go oh Habs Go
Yeah come on Habs Empire
Wanna raise that cup up high

When I'm feeling like I wanna show the world what greatness is
Red and blue and white sweater, the C-H it is
When I wanna feel the ghosts of the legends
I rock my vintage old school Morenz seven
When I want to show we got way more cups than your team
Turn around and flash my Richard 16
When these haters go on an all out attack
My number 30 Nilan always has my back
Yeah when I need a little enforcement
Clip the fight straps on my 2-7 Corson
When I wanna be the kinda dude you can lean on
Believe I've got my number 12 Mike Keane on
When I wanna feel a burst of speed and power
Chances are I got the jersey with the Number 10 Flower
When I give a wink like you can't see me
Betcha I'm wearing my Roy 3-3

We rock the sweater
We rock it proud
Rock like Carrier
We rock it loud
Throw on that C-H Go
And let the whole world know
That we rock the sweater
We rock it proud
Rock like Carrier
We rock it loud
Red, blue and white flags fly
We wanna raise that cup up high
Go oh Habs Go
yea Come on Habs Empire
We wanna raise that cup up high

Sometimes I need a touch of class when I'm feelin' low
So I get a lift from my 4 Beliveau
When you see I got a lotta weapons in my arsenal
I got ‘em all from my 21 Carbonneau
When I gotta be clutch and win it the hard way
I rock my 28 Desjardins
When I'm looking for a little refinement
You'll probably see me wearing number 29 Dryden
When I wanna gain loyalty and trust
I'm starting to straight bust my number 8 Prust
When I'm feeling like somebody needs a levelin'
I hit em with the 7-4 Emelin
When I wanna get all jacked up like a true fan
Get in beast mode with my 7-6 Subban
When I wanna shut em down, put ‘em on ice
That's when I rock my 3-1 Price
When I'm feeling like I just might fall apart
Put 11 on my back and a C on my heart
Can't separate a Habs fan from his sweater
That's why I'll rock number 9 forever

We rock the sweater
We rock it proud
Rock like Carrier
We rock it loud
Throw on that C-H Go
And let the whole world know
That we rock the sweater
We rock it proud
Rock like Carrier
We rock it loud
Red, blue and white flags fly
Cause it's feelin' like twenty-five
Go oh Habs Go
Yeah come on Habs Empire
Wanna raise that cup up high
Go oh Habs Go
Keep singing Habs for life
Cause it's feelin like twenty-five
