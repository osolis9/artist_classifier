Right-Now:Berner
Remind me, yeah

Go whiter hash, no bill chain
Every few years I need a new strain
I party all night at the beach house
Stuck all day on the couch in a weed cloud
Whizo pulled up in a lambo, we blowing kk by the elbow
I put 20 k on the ball game, louie v scarf and a hundred dollar...
I'm sliding through the city like I run shit,
Hunned pack flip, I'm a dumb shit
Looking in the eyes of your child
Now she wants to fuck a king, but I'm cool off a pump bitch
Fit so clean what it cost me? Not a damn thing cause she bought me
Everything I wanted when she took me out shopping
She's smiling and laughing, weed got her coughing

[Hook:]
Riding round town, in a topless whip, yeah, yeah
So it's safe to say I'm so in love with life, right now

My head's so high from the extracts,
You know big bern got the best packs
Good when the box get chest ex
Titties on my screen when she text back
I'm sitting in the benz watching bread stack
Blowing kush smoke out the sun roof
Looking at the money n the brown bag
I'm thinking bout the money that I run through
Big flat screens on my crib dough
4 am I'm a drive slow, hook just ride with my eyes low
I make the coke blocks take a fly up
Ssf city on my back still, you know he soft, why even tryina act real
Forever keep the pack sealed, press one button make the hatch meld

On my passenger side, is a topless chick, yeah, yeah
So it's safe to say I'm so in love with life, right now,
Okay, bottles up, cups full, yeah
And the aroma of tranvy pots surrounds the room
If Shawty got potential, I can be her sponsor
For you to even know me that alone is a honor
Girl tell me what you wanna do

[Hook:]
Riding round town, in a topless whip, yeah, yeah
So it's safe to say I'm so in love with life, right now
Now, and on my passenger side, there's a topless chick
So it's safe to say I'm so in love with life, right now, whoa, yeah, whoa.
