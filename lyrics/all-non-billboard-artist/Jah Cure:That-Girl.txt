That-Girl:Jah Cure
When I find that girl
I'll lock her down
I swear that girl
Will be the only one for me
The one that makes my life complete
When I find that girl
I'll hold her down
I swear that girl
She'll be the one that conquer me
Her loving takes control of me

Could you be at one of my shows
Good love it's almost like I'll never know
Could you be in front of my face
Good love is something is that I want to embrace

I got a King size bed but no Queen to share it with me
Said that I wanna know your name right now, right now

When I find that girl
I'll lock her down
I swear that girl
Will be the only one for me
The one that makes my life complete
When I find that girl
I'll hold her down
I swear that girl
She'll be the one that conquers me
Her loving takes control of me

Could it be my next-door neighbor?
Real Love, I'm keeping on my best behavior
Could it be my closest friend?
Real Love, it can never be the same again

Got a fancy car but got no one to ride with me
Said that I wanna know your name right now, right now
So

When I find that girl
I'll lock her down
I swear that girl
Will be the only one for me
The one that makes my life complete
When I find that girl
I'll hold her down
I swear that girl
She'll be the one to conquers me
Her loving takes control of me
