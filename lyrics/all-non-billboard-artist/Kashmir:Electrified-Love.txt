Electrified-Love:Kashmir
The sun is breaking out the buds
Slicing every cloud
She's in the cherry blossom snow
Taking showers

The whole city's fragrant with belief
It's a hard and rude life
And her saliva's on my sleeve
Today is mine

She falls into place as
The boxes in tetris
I run out of phrases
And into the shock
Of electrified love

Days travel at the speed of light
And the shortage in my stash
I start to run but petrify
She is a flash
That drives me out of reverie
Back to the green shade of the yard
The future magnetises her feet
... open ... in her arms

We fall into place as
Two boxes in tetris
Scratching our faces
In one soft ricochet
Of wet and dry lips

Antipathy surrounds us
Like an overgrown trail
Of sharp, hawthorn branches
That rip like nails

The night is full of headshots
Displayed across the road
But it's not invisible
It's not invisible

Cherry blossom snow
She's in the cherry blossom snow
