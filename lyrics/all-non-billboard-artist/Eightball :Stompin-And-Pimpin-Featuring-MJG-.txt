Stompin-And-Pimpin-Featuring-MJG-:Eightball 
Let it loose, mature content

Here we come again bitch in your mothafuckin' face
Eightball and M J fuckin' G rippin' up the place
Comin' out hard like I told you I was gonna do
At the Marriott lettin' your hoe do what she wanna do

Not because I paid her or made her
Nigga who you think I be a trick and give my money up? Uh
No no I got game for a hoe, baggets and combo
In a wooded out Tahoe, murder niggaz

Cane slangin', gang bangin'
Hand language got my mind twisted and tangled
I remember walkin' up and down orange mound
Memphis Tenn, that's my mothafuckin' stompin' ground

Made it out, givin' back, bustin' dope raps
You can't run in every neighborhood they bustin' caps
Country niggaz tinted out, gettin' fucked up
The wrong move will get your whole crew fucked up

I wouldn't speak it, if I never thought it dig this
You criticize this, bitch I live this
So I keep my pen and I keep my 4 5th
Light a spliff, nigga me and G comin' through

Stompin', pimpin', ain't no competition
Stompin', pimpin', we the shit nigga
Stompin', pimpin', bitch come and get some

We got that big pimpin' and I'm big footin'
Shit I'm doin' it, you couldn't
Hell, suave house got it locked down
Nigga, you shouldn't, even try

To fuck with M J should I pimp this for exercise
Woman I don't want your pussy, now rest your thighs
No testin' eyes, stays on my B's and U's and D's
I got my P H T D pimp hoes to death in '83

Memories they rollin' over
Dick riders, keep me focused
Huh, what you say bro, you ain't know this
Get off the ground, now you know this

And bitch, shut up talkin' to me with that same old
Say, say, like a, can I touch your braids and a, can I see you shades?
Hell no bitch, can I see you dough, can I see your jaws?
Get away from me, old groupie ass bitch go suck some balls

Ain't no stoppin' us
Niggaz, you need to realize, quickly
Fuck you, if you, niggaz with me, cool ass teacher

Yeah, we be droppin' dope shit for the real ones
Niggaz got real guns, 'cause they make real funds
Hood cats, who only fuck with hood rats
Blunt rollin' hoes, holdin' on to daddy's sack

Stashin' gats, if I ask, she gon' let it loose
I practiced tellin' hoes everything but the truth
Stay away from funky niggaz 'cause they turn to thieves
On my knees, meditatin' smokin' trees

Shootin' game, with hardcore rap agility
Cross the globe with my southern mack ability
Black fat nigga all about my green stack nigga
We pack nigga, this ain't no act nigga
