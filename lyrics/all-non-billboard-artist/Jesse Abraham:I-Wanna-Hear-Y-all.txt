I-Wanna-Hear-Y-all:Jesse Abraham
I'm bein honest
I'm the bee in your bonnet
I'm beyond bein appeasing
I ain't bein ironic
A busy bee, I'm the bees knees
I leave felines pleased as punch
Cats catch the sonic
Boom boom or bam bam
A blast from the past
Like blues clue or van dam
The cat's out the bag
I zoom through like Grand Ams
It's true you are Ham fans
Like YouTube or Rubix Cubes view my grand slam
Graham was a cracker, I'm more like Betty Crocker
Not a actor with an angle
Protractor
No doctor
No tractor
No opera
No fact or
No copper
I'm the lowest common factor
Fiction?
I'm improper
Like a fraction with friction, I'm magic with diction
I'm practically flippin phonics backwards
Rippin and robbin
Rockin and rollin
Stopping the strollin
My rhymes gotchu pausing often like commas and colons

Hey - Have you got some to say?
Go ahead I'm listening
Please do not be afraid
I wanna hear y'all
Yo - Where did ya voices go?
Let's all enjoy the show
Boise's in Idaho
I wanna hear y'all

A bird in the hand's worth two in the bush
I know you workin with hands, jerkin, lurkin after tush
For certain you stand for purple and kush
I'm workin
My purpose is perfect, circular
Hush
Puppies and yuppies are lucky to touch me
Most groupies are pudgy or droopy, ugly and yucky
Like puddie it's silly but really it's funny
A millie vanilli philly's only filling for dummies
A dead ringer like a phone on vibrate
I'm irate like old folks watchin Elvis gyrate
So dilate pupil, you a carbon copy
Savin rhymes on a disc whether hard or floppy
Sloppy joes don't feed me
I'm eating flows and beats, speaking
And havoc I'm wreaking
Whether it's fact or it's feces
Rap can appear to be easy
Actually that's deceiving

Hey - Have you got some to say?
Go ahead I'm listening
Please do not be afraid
I wanna hear y'all
Yo - Where did ya voices go?
Let's all enjoy the show
Boise's in Idaho
I wanna hear y'all

I'm stackin a bag and attachin it with the shit that I got
if you're lackin a sack then match me every hit for a shot
I'm thinking about the plan, you're handin your stamina to me
Your energy was spent for free,
I got a camera close to me
Psyche, is this supposed to be a life with no potency?
My focus was hocus pocus now I suppose the joke is me
The doom is growin like tumors and showin that humor is just a rumor
All the villains are killin and spillin the blood of all these baby boomers
20 years of my life was spent hidin behind lies
I'm bringing it back to facts, bitch, my rhymes never die
My mind's feverish, I had a seizure twitch
Rather be feared or respected?
You ain't neither, shit
This rhyme's leisure it's nothin for me to be spittin
Every lyric you rip is something doesn't need to be written
Y'all wanna party
Ain't listening hardly
I'm an artiste
Everything I think it gets RTed

Hey - Have you got some to say?
Go ahead I'm listening
Please do not be afraid
I wanna hear y'all
Yo - Where did ya voices go?
Let's all enjoy the show
Boise's in Idaho
I wanna hear y'all
