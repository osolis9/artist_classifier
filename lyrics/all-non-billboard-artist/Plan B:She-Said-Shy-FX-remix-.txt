She said, "I love you boy, I love you so"
She said, "I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said, "I love you more than words can say"
She said, "I love you ba-a-aby"

So I said, "What you sayin' girl, it can't be right
How can you be in love with me? We only just met tonight"
So she said, "Boy, I loved you from the start
When I first heard "Love Goes Down" something started burning in my heart"

I said, "Stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door"

She said, "But I love you boy, I love you so"
She said, "I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said, "I love you more than words can say"
She said, "I love you ba-a-aby"
(Yes, she did)

So now I'm up in the courts pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested, "I'm innocent," I protested
"She just feels rejected had her heart broken by someone she's obsessed with"

She likes sound of my music, which makes her a fan of my music
That's why "Love Goes Down" makes her lose it 'cause she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this from the stand but my girl cries tears from the galleries
This has got bigger than I ever could have planned like that song by The Zutons "Valerie"

So the jury don't look like their buying it and she's making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced like I'm trying it, their eyes fixed on me like I'm murderous
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key
They wanna send me down even though I told them she

She said, "I love you boy, I love you so"
She said, "I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said, "I love you more than words can say"
She said, "I love you ba-a-aby"

So I said, "Why the hell you gotta treat me this way?"
You don't know what love is
You wouldn't do this if you did
Oh no, no, no
