Flying High
YouAnnotate and me still flying high
Chasing you like fireflies
You can be my guiding light

Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around
Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around

By your side
Yes I will be by your side
None to fear and none to hid
You can be my guiding light

Every word
That you feel you cannot share
Keeps us from a brighter day
A happiness beyond compare
Beyond compare
(Compare to you!)

Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around
Girl you better make it good to me
Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around
(Ooh turn around!)

Now I know
Love's a different animal
Do we ever start to grow?
Or is is something all for show?
All for show

If you won't stop then I won't stop
Baby let's make a way
If you hold on I won't let go
Cause baby you saved the day
