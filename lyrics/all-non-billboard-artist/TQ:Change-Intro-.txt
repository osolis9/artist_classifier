They Never Saw Me Comin'
Change (Intro)
To all my peoples
Got a little story to tell
Straight from the ghetto
Some of you gon feel it
Some of y'all ain't
Don't matter
Still gon tell it
Cos I heard a long time ago
That changes were gonna come
And I know you been waiting
They never saw me coming
That's the way it is
So we're here to take you
On a joyride
To the new millennium base (or baby)
(Or Bow down to a new way of life)
About ass
It's a new way of life

(just wanna say thank you jesus)
