Music-to-My-Soul:XL
Where I come from
I've seen things that you wouldn't believe
But once your heart is there, you can never leave
I wrote this here for everyone to see
It was calling me, kept calling me

Even in darkness
Me and my fam from the dungeon found that light
And even in darkness
Despite what was wrong, everything's gonna be alright

Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul
Even in darkness

Well look at me now, I'm everything that I wanted to be
But once your heart is there, you can never leave
A star in the sky for everyone to see
You can follow me, follow me

Even in darkness
Me and my fam from the dungeon found that light
And even in darkness
Despite what was wrong, everything turned out alright

Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul

Well we got Jo and Mo and Gipp and 'Lo
And yes Big Rube, and Backbone, Organ No is Pat, Rico and Ray
And we've got the Witchdoctor and yes Cool Breeze
And all the young homies from the dungeon east
I can't forget my brothers, Big and Dre

Even in darkness
Me and my fam from the dungeon found that light
And even in darkness
Despite what was wrong, everything turned out alright

Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul
Said whoa
