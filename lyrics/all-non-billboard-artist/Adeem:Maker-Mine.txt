Maker-Mine:Adeem
It's ironic that I'd die for the chance to live again
Spreading my wings as they brush on tree's floating on the wind
Makes no sense that I would lose it all just to gain one honest belonging
Holding it so tight because it asked me to free myself from yawing
These are the serious moments described as the same old agenda
And it takes that special look to find the one hidden within pretenders
If it's out there I'll find it, going to any length possible
Deep down inside I know the feelings and their hard to kill
So I will stuff it down and ask myself out loud just to make sure
Is this protection for my sanity or to find someone that's pure
It's never enough and there's no complete trust
But how could I ever hate the opposite sex
When it's fee they are all I have left
This is my last resort to make the picture worth it
This is my last chance to kill off this weak defensive stance
Because they say in this world there is someone for everyone
But I'm struggling to find someone that hasn't experienced everyone
And I believe that finding the perfect one has nothing to do with perfection
All I can hope for is finding salvation in a traveler walking the same direction
I'm using a harp and a piano as a serenade and a warning
Sending a message to corrupted searchers dedicated to exploring

My feet are firmly planted where I stand
and it would take all you have to knock me down
Because my strength comes from knowing
that one day she'll come around

It takes more than 30 days to truly get away
Using suffocation as elation, to start molding clay
From a makeshift wedding band to a personalized skeleton key
Even I agree that being alone is a definite possibility
It's all lip service, with a worthless purpose
Experimenting with love because you curious
My testament is courteous
I still believe in covering puddles with nothing but respect
But I need to learn separation to keep from getting too complex
But when the connection loses clarity, I turn into an oracle
Struggling to be cordial while passing judgment in my own thoughts
I'm a loyalist to a conformist that changed right before my eyes
Making it perfectly clear how easy it is to slice right through my ties
Here is my obeisance to the female intuition
No more thoughts of settling down until I truly learn to listen
For the signs of fixation and warning signs of dying intimacy
Sleepless night and lonely conversations to tell me what is killing me
But I offer deep eyes and a trustworthy disposition
By granting freedom with a home to come back to completing your vision
I have the wisdom of 50 birthdays jam packed into 23 years
Steering myself into oblivion looking for that equal match
And I have sucked all the innocence that I can from these frontiers
So I turn the lights off in this empty room and fade to black

My leap of faith is connected to walking down that aisle
Holding the hand of my shadow enjoying her smile
No more compromises my lessons will still be learned
Walking away from the flames that carelessly burned
I never doubted her existence with every secret that I kept
I say a prayer before I die hoping that there's some time left
I never doubted her existence with every secret that I kept
I say a prayer before I die hoping that there's some time left...
