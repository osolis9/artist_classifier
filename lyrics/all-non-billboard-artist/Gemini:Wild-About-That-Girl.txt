Wild-About-That-Girl:Gemini
She is a goddess!

Turbo lightning
Striking me
And I'm falling
Like a tree
Cool and calm and collected
Prouder than a queen
Standing at the bar beside me
Girl, where have you been

Legs that never stop and streaming hair
I've been searching everywhere

I'm wild about that girl
I'm wild about that woman
Look at the way she's holding her head
Sexy enough to wake the dead
I'm wild about that girl
I'm wild about that woman
She is a goddess, she is divine
And I intend to make her mine

I can't let her
Walk away
But I don't know
What to say
She's a regular stunner
Time is rushing by
Gotta make a move and quickly
But my mouth is dry
Just as I'm about to take my chance
She says: 'Would you like to dance'

I'm wild about that girl
I'm wild about that woman
Look at the way she's holding her head
Sexy enough to wake the dead
I'm wild about that girl
I'm wild about that woman
She is a goddess, she is divine
And I intend to make her mine

Just as I'm about to take my chance
She says: 'Hey, do you want to dance'

I'm wild about that girl
I'm wild about that woman
Look at the way she's holding her head
Sexy enough to wake the dead
I'm wild about that girl
I'm wild about that woman
She is a goddess, she is divine
And I intend to make her mine

I'm wild about that girl...
