Tragedy-Com:Psycho Realm
You're online type in a password from your own mind
What you think is top secret got insiders thinking they're all mine
Y2K year two thousand is when they go blind
Shut down machines scrambling while media co-signs
Predesigned programs that kill technology romance
Set up for chaos make you and destiny slow dance
So the storm lands microchip in your wrist and they'll insist
That this will make life easier troubleless
Hassle-free but actually none of this is for the best
Interest or the progress of society, buying me?
You can call me paranoid but paranoia's a defense mechanism
From those trying to destroy ya
Don't let them throw ya off course
Keep that money safe buried in your backyard
And beware of the pale horse

These tragic scenes unfold and cause panic
Organized crime families control automatically
Computer chip slanging to new age fanatics
Stuck to your PC screens like addicts
Madness and online freedom bandits
Create you a World Wide Web of sadness
This sick plan to assist the removal of democracy
Won't miss

We're caught in webs of mind control screens
And through world wide revolt you find tragedy
We fight the scenes
Enemies and computer chip slaveryâ€¦ tragedy

Computer components are considered Demonic Masonic
Made by the enlightened opponent they own it
They control it flood the market target the dormant
Claiming that they simplify but really complicate the moment
In a glance we think hollow follow the prize
Swallow the shallow lies strive where we wallow
Computer age stage millennium plague vague but certain
Open the curtain digital burden

Strangers link to you bring danger
Red sky signs of the weather
Being controlled a world wide light show
And they know the commands for rain, wind, snow
Codes punched in produce storms
And can't be stopped with the use of fire arms
Anti-government groups get shot
And we slide into the age of robot
Cops enforce world orders and bring static
And civilians and the uniformed go at it
Wild fights ignite in the middle of the night
Into the daylight
Reported acts to enslave on track
And we push our hack platoon to get started
Terrorists through e-mail drop bombs
