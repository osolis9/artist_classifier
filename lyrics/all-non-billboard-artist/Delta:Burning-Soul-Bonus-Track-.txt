Burning-Soul-Bonus-Track-:Delta
You once said I'd never survive
But here I am now, just rising again
Fighting my demons with all my might
Spilling their blood, just feel my rage
Now I see, all is clear for me
In this time and place I feel alive again
Before, I felt nothing but grief
Crying in the shadows but not anymore
Now I'm the person that I wish to be
Facing the world just on my own
Just turn your back on fear
Feel my burning soul
Never thought that the answer was there
In front of my eyes, I couldn't believe
Always remember, don't forget your past
A tree without its roots, can never stand still
Now I see, all is clear for me
In this time and place I feel alive again
Before, I felt nothing but fear
Running forever but not anymore
Now I'm the person that I wish to be
Facing the world just on my own
Just turn your back on fear
Feel my burning soul!!

Before, I felt nothing but grief
Crying in the shadows but not anymore
Now I'm the person that I wish to be
Facing the world just on my own
Before, I felt nothing but grief
Crying in the shadows but not anymore
Now I'm the person that I wish to be
Facing the world just on my own
Just turn your back on fear
Feel my burning soul
