I stepped out to the club it’s the same old scene 
Got hipsters everywhere with they tight ass jeans 
Chickens sittin at the bar singin buy me a drink 
Mad Im staring at your bra what the fuck did you think 
DJ pon de replay paid to spin 
Skip the line got inside still paid to get in

Sittin at my table man 
Cocktail waitress still wanna table dance 
Fam 
If you dont get the drinks we order right now 
My n#%$s bout to wild out and start to tear shit down 
Wow 
Then I seen the badest woman all night 
Walked up to her she was dancing under them lights 
Dressed so tight 
Smile so bright 
Moving so nice style so right 
She was like I'm bout to smoke this ounce 
Lets go somewhere and chill out 
After that let’s bounce

Come on let’s rock 
My man down the block got an after hours spot 
And I think it’s gonna be ill 
A place we can relax 
A spot we can chill 
Of course you can bring your friends 
Just as long as there’s no men and they all got ends 
I'm playing

Let’s go in there and 
Get it in 
After that let’s go

Dig it’s to far from the house 
Before I could get a word out 
She was playing pretend 
Me and her friend on the couch 
Ouch ouch ouch 
She’s aggressive 
Started getting shy cuz im attentive 
Ow ow ow 
The possession 
Headed to the crib 
Getting naked 
Wow wow wow 
Comin out the lingerie draws 
Shoulda seen what I saw dog 
What I feel is dope 
But I aint in to coke 
E or anything 
I just want fuck and stroke 
Put your throat back 
Hold that

Throw it back 
Whatever way you wanna give it better take it 
And when I smack it 
I just wanna make it
