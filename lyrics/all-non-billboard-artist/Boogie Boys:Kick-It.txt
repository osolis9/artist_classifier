Kick-It:Boogie Boys
[CHORUS: both]
If it's a lollypop - lick it
A fresh Bic - flick it
A wack shot - stick it
A def girl - kick it

Kick it

[VERSE 1: (Boogie Knight &) Romeo JD]
(My name is Boogie Knight, he's Romeo JD
And now he will emcee)
Well, this is the deal and the deal is for real
I refuse to conceal the special way that I feel
(About a girl) real cutie (pretty eyes) def booty
(Like a queen) sheer beauty (do you mean?) yes, it's my duty
To dazzle and daze and mentally phase
Find ways to amaze her charm and praise
Her not with a rope or a neck full of gold
But a bass from the heart and a rap from the soul
Being clean and serene and every young girl's dream
Cause I'm the new James Dean of the hip-hop scene
While the fellas be (sleepin it) then I'll be (peepin it)
But you can bet if it's correct I'm (keepin it)
But you can't wait, procrastinated the bait
Cause if you wait to scoop a date it's probably way too late
So listen up troop, I won't say it no more
You wanna scoop a girl, then this is the law

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 2: Boogie Knight]
Boogie Knight, the type of guy not interested in what's under your stomach only
So when I kick my rap, girl, you get more stimulation to your heart, baby
And when I noticed the shape, the structure of your thigh it's not because my nature
has risen
It's only because I'm observin and I noticed the blessing someone was given
Now, on your birth certificate could've been the pretty name of Amazing Grace
You put a smile on my face with grace and amazingly you put other girls to waste
And your body could've been that of a model or the daughter of Cleopatra, you know
Because from head to toe you have an excuse for a big ego
May I call you Sugar? How about Azucar?
Exquisite like caviar, one kiss on my cheek and my mind goes boom-zoom far
(To) to another place sometime, baby doll, you blow my mind
So when I kick it to you I kick it to a girl I know is one of a kind
