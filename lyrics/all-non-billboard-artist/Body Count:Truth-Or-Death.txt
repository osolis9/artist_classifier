Truth-Or-Death:Body Count
Lies, betrayal, lies, truth or death
Lies, betrayal, lies

Who the fuck can I trust?
The whole fuckin' world is built on deception, false perception
Look you dead in the eye and lie
Your best friend'll stab you in the back, yo, what the fuck is that

Politicians lie, what the fuck is that?
Your lover lies, what the fuck is that?
The police lies, what the fuck is that?
The church fuckin' lies, what the fuck is that?

Somebody tell me where's the truth
Every holy book is written by man, probably by a liar's hand
And if you feel that public schools are teachin'
Truth to the youth, motherfucka you livin' a lie too

Lawyers lie, what the fuck is that?
Doctors lie, what the fuck is that?
Doctors lie, what the fuck is that?
Your mother and father lie, what the fuck is that?
You lie to yourself, yo, what the fuck is that?

There is no truth only variations of lies
Don't try to figure it out
Honesty is extinct and if
It ever did exist the human race took it out
