She-Was-Just-A-Friend:Miri Ben-Ari
I never meant to hurt you
She was just a friend

I know I've made mistakes
Times before did ignore
The pain in your voice
There was writing on the wall

And it don't take a fool to see
You were right for me
Meant to be in the beginning
Why we had to take this fall

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

Girl, I never meant to hurt you
Didn't really mean to hurt you
Tried my best to show I love you
And it all turned out so wrong

I'll be sitting waiting for you
'Cause I know patience is a virtue
Gonna do just what I got to
Girl, I love you

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I had some time to think about this
She's your friend and not our friend
That was a problem from the beginning
I care for you and I trust you too without guessing
But intentions of some folks, I had to question

I tried my best to show you I loved you
I never thought you'd hurt my emotions
If she was just a friend then why does it hurt so?
If there's nothing going on, honey, I will stay with you

It's like a plan gone wrong since you've been gone
Nights alone, my worlds gone cold
It's like I'm hiding from my soul

I had to meditate and concentrate
On doing with disappointing me
Honey, I want to come home

Tried my best to show you I loved you
Even though I hurt your emotions
She was just a friend I knew from before
She was just a friend, there was nothing going on
Girl, all my life's for you

I never thought you'd hurt my emotions
