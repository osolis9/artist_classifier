Bring-You-War:Kb
If you want a war
I'll bring it on
Watch as the walls of your city fall
That's beautiful

I've been told that you've gotta play the game
Comb my hair, wear khaki pants, and I'll be a man, uh
And I've been told

Count the risk, but we fear God over consequence
Hear you're talkin' down lookin' from the bleachers
Keep your words sweet, you may have to eat them
You don't know Emmanuel
You a lion in a den full of Daniels
Even if we all weigh this advantage
I've still got the candle cuffs

I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know if you are wrong or if I'm right but
If you want a war, I'll give you war
I'll bring the walls of Jericho down to prove you wrong
Yeah ah

They made us feel we not as good as them (yeah)
I told them they not as good as Him (yeah)
From the part of town where you missed the privilege
One good for every ten bad decisions
Momma said you will not be a victim
Try to bury us we have since convinced them
Go out of control son seize the system
Now I own the business with
Nappy hair and I wear sweatpants, and I'm still a man
They pick us last for the game kid
That mean we the ones that you don't wanna play with
Made with anguish, game six, my behavior
New Orleans flow, spice it up and win the occasion
Renegades is ragin' until this place is made
Grace on grace on grace the weak and dangerous
Yeah, you might have lapped me
But you ain't the only one that's laughin'
My super power is I don't quit
And a God that will go with, go with

I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know if you are wrong or if I'm right but
If you want a war, I'll give you war
I'll bring the walls of Jericho down to prove you wrong
If you want a war, I'll bring it on
I'll bring the walls of Jericho down to prove you wrong
Yeah ah

I will sing with men and angels
Whom shall I fear but You alone
I am helpless without You near me
Through my weakness, oh my God, You've proven strong
I will sing with men and angels
Whom shall fear but You alone
And He said to my enemies

If you want a war, I'll give you war
I'll bring the walls of Jericho down to prove you wrong
If you want a war, I'll bring it all
I'll bring the walls of Jericho down to prove you wrong
Yeah ah
