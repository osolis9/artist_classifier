Keep-Your-Kings-in-the-Back-Row:Cassie
Is this something that you started to regret? 
See our world through distorted eyes, we keep telling different sides of the same lie 
I can't love you any better than this and if your dreams go to waste tonight you'll give me the saddest smile, take this with you 
Oh you gotta take this with you, you should know by now 

You are so afraid of life and I only have courage for myself 
I cannot carry you through this 
I'm not the savior you're searching for so close the door 
You're letting the cold in 

Are we something that you started to regret? 
This time the strong follows the strong, this time I need someone brave I'm not your shelter from the storm. 
Am I something that you started to regret? 
At least I told you from the start that I was not prepared to handle a heart 

You are so afraid of life and I only have courage for myself 
I cannot carry you through this 
I'm not the savior you're searching for so close the door 
You're letting the cold in
