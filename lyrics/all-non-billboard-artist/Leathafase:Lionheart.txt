Lionheart:Leathafase
[Chorus: Leathafase]
Get that money man, Stay G'd up
Keep your gun cocked, Blow that weed up
Get that gwap stacked, Flip your re-up
Look at you now kid you got that lionheart
Play the block hard, Go get your sneakers scuffed
Keep your knife sharp, Apply deep cuts
But go against mine, Your Swiss cheese'd up
Slow your speed up, I'll send you to meet your maker

[Leathafase]
I fire flames in the flesh, Call me the human torch
My music got dirty South thugs busting off the porch
Turning out clubs, Love feel the stallion's force
Suck me off, They use my DNA source for lip gloss
Big boss you aint hard, Your image a mirage
A Maybach in your video when you don't own a car
I'm live'r then a Rolling Stones guitar in concert
Pop powerful revolvers that makes my arms jerk
My beautiful artwork, Collages and sculptures
Authentic handcrafted by the head of the vultures
Shot dead in your loafers with that suit and tie rap
These bars a lot of heroin son, I provide that
The thirst of Blade mixed with a Venus Fly Trap
When a cardex hear the voice of a drug dealer through wire tap
So I retired to rap before my empire collapsed
With me on the front page wide firing gats

[Chorus]

[Leathafase]
It's Leathafase cocking, With that strong arm journal
With metaphors that burn through your Sean John thermal
This beef doesn't concern you, Don't get drafted in the war
Or get cut like sheet rock, Then plastered to the wall
Into a casket your hole, From your rise to fall
Got aired out compared to a deflated basket ball
As the madness falls, I rain Hell on the Earth
Counting my shells incase I have to put in extra work
The flow is berserk, You receive lacerations on your face
From intense lyrical fabrications
My classifications, Marked to be the best
A hole the size of a dinner plate where your heart used to rest
Target the flesh, In the cross hairs on the scope
The use your blood for the ink in every line that's wrote
I got the illest pen movements, Kill you with one stroke
Then call you pin cushion man after your lungs get poked

[Chorus]

[Leathafase]
Thug I'll silence your mug, With an Idaho spud
At the end of the barrel it's lights out, Your plugged
I got an army full of Bloods, And an army full of Crips
That get it pop'n and crack'n, Plus I dump my own clips
Pump all my own strips, Breathe breath into your lungs
I may live by the guns but I'm a Father to my son
Not honor'n some young individual to go kill
But everything I write I did, And if I did then I will
Skills are matched, Rap with explosive devices attached
To my mouth, One spat I blow your head piece back
INF-Black on my right, Desert Eagle on my left
We stay strapped for the fight, To lethal inject death
Disrespect my set, Shells burst through your chest
Then scatters your flesh all over the T.V.'s in your head rest
This is the end of the stretch, Here to produce stacks
Mental destruction, Under the production of costa tracks

[Chorus]
