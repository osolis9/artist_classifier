Step-Back:People Under the Stairs
[Intro]
Well, we’re movin’ on up…
Be the champion…
Step up front
Check it
Step up front
Step up, step up, nigga, step up
Tell ‘em who you is, man
Tell ‘em who you is, man

[Double K:]
Yo, it’s the West Coast, shit-talking b-boy from the Eighties
Y’all niggas know the name, the game won’t change
You heard it plenty of times, said it in many of rhymes
No need to repeat, just listen to the beat
And you see where we’re coming from, it’s what you running from
Over there in the dark, with the funky old drummer
I’m about to break it down like it should’ve been broke
Way back, before dudes was coming way whack
We one step ahead of y'all stupid motherfuckers
Got your girl singing over a loop
Well, that’s cute
Yo, no time for good looks, keep that shit on CD
‘Cause the P’s blacking niggas out, you only get one try
Everybody’s curious to hear what we’re bringing, nothing soft
Just wicked beats to keep your ears ringing, like bass in your face
You heard it a long time ago
Rockin’ people under Thes
Since I had a broke fo’, and here’s the logo for all the people in the West
From Seattle to the Burg, but aloe socks you in the chest
Take one step up and see my name on the decks, figure it out
You would guess, getting made into a mess
That little girl’s in a dress
Ay-yo, that’s the style
‘Cause I’ll beat you on a road that only rides half a mile
So when you fall off, I’ll be right here making much noise
Using your promo as toys, you get paranoid and say what
These two dudes ain’t joking, damn right
Next Step, get you vexed, People Under The Stairs
Beware and don’t enter, beware and don’t enter
Brother Thes is up next, so beware and don’t enter…

[Hook]
That’s called a step, that’s called a step
Then I follow with the next one
Step up y’all

[Thes One:]
It’s the Next Step, Part Two, slept on the first
Worse if you slumber on the sequel, one verse, versus us, no equal
On the planet this Hispanic take not a granite rock for granted
I love it all, trees, and I rock for free, I rock steadily, like Aretha
It’s the People beneath the staircase where placed funk flows steadily
Rock tracks, I sit back, catch the contact, and I just wait
My Next Step: create a way to communicate on tape, I grab a pen
Sparks fly off the paper, taper off into an entity, recall the P
P equals Double K and me, T-H-E-S-O-N-E
Do you know any b-boys that are making some noise
Yes
Who?
Double K and Thes
Ooh, those brothers are really bad
One’s dad used to play the drums
And the other played the congas with his thumbs, and his sons
They got the funk, too
Who?
Hey, that’s us dude
Dum da-dum da-da-da doo-doo
I represent all my Latins up in Harvard Heights
Twentysomething females, switch off the wild nights
Open mics get a grand opening, all nights
Capital P rock the party, aiight?

[Outro]
That’s called a step, that’s called a step
Ay-yo, we’re moving on up
