[Chorus]
[Jodie Connor]
I'm gonna leave the day behind
Don't you worry
'cause I'm gonna have a real good time

[Wiley]
We're gonna have a real good time

[Jodie Connor]
I'm gonna leave the world outside
Spend my money
'Cause it's gonna be a real good night

[Wiley]
We're gonna have a real good night
Let's go late night shopping
High street bopping
Let's go West End clubbing
Champagne popping
Let's keep it rocking
Party ain't stopping
Let's keep it, keep it rocking
Party ain't stopping

â€¦

[Jodie Connor]
9 to 5 (oh oh)
When it's over I can come alive (oh oh)
I'm in the mood to live a higher life (oh oh)
Now when the DJ drops the subli mine
I'll be satisfied

[Chorus]
[Jodie Connor]
I'm gonna leave the day behind
Don't you worry
'cause I'm gonna have a real good time

[Wiley]
We're gonna have a real good time

[Jodie Connor]
I'm gonna leave the world outside
Spend my money
'Cause it's gonna be a real good night

[Wiley]
We're gonna have a real good night
