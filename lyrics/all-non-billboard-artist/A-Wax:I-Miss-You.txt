I-Miss-You:A-Wax
I miss you...
Miss you so bad.
I don't forget you...
Oh it's so sad...

Think about drunk, think about it high
If I think about it too much I'ma cry
Think about it now, thought about it then
I was free when you were caught up in the pen

You were free while I was caught up in the box
Smoked together til it brought us both apart
Only did what they had taught us on the block
People saw us coming started calling cops

People saw us coming started ducking shots
All that shit together's hard to fucking watch
All that shit just keep on playing in my head
Playing with my chopper laying in my bed

Wanna tell you something every single day
But I never get to say it cause ya dead
Wanna tell you something every single day
But I never get to say it cause ya dead

I miss you...
Miss you so bad.
I don't forget you you...
Ooh it's so sad...

Uhh, standing at your grave 'Man this isn't right'
If mom only saw me damaging your life
Now that I know all the damage was for life
I wish I could take it back and make it right

Living with the pain, coping with the guilt
I could finally start open up for real
Looking at your son wishing he was here

I could finally start to see the picture clear
So what if they think I'm being insincere
I know they can't wait for me to disappear
I know they forgot you, but I never will

Only its just like a cut that never heals
Wanna bring you with me as a move along
But I never get to do it cause ya gone
Wanna bring you with me moving on the road
But I never get to do it, hope you know
I miss you...
Miss you so bad.
I don't forget you...
Ooh it's so sad...
