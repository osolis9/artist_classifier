Blow-Up:GP Wu
All my brothers, what?
Let the world know it's hot 9, 7, what?
Shaolin take it to the top all the ladies
Show some love sugar, it's on tonight
Keepin' the party tight aight

I be the one to break through your barrier
Bomb carrier ready to explode in hype mode
You'll catch a bad decision at any given
I was marked for death, so now this is how the fuck I'm livin'?

Let me lay the law, let me connect four
GP the brand new reign, fuck what you sayin' and thought
Standin' tall but you comin' up short
Might play a lot of games but this ain't your sport

Ran into the wrong one, I'm the son of a gun
You target practice, I'ma hit you off for fun
Answer one question, what crossed your mind?
To make you think that you could fuck with my hip hop design

You out of fashion, on top of that you got me laughin'
Like a gun toter up against an assassin
I'm the real McCoy, old school B Boy
Anything I seek, I could create or destroy

It's like that, born with the strength to strike back
Full contact better wear your hardhat in combat
It's either you or my contract
All you gotta say is where we get it on at and it's on

All my brothers, what?
Let the world know it's hot 9, 7, what?
Shaolin take it to the top all the ladies
Show some love sugar, it's on tonight
Keepin' the party tight aight

Movin' in a city of crooks where they don't play by the books
It's off the hook, got me on crop
Ready to pop somethin' in my circumference if we don't rock
But a lot of niggas snitch makin' the streets too hot

Bitches too wanna be up in people's personal affairs
Let it die down, get it out the air
Gossipin' to get rich, callin' 1-800 tips
Hundred dollar ho went international on the Richard Bey Show

Everybody wanna blow overnight
The secret to my success is I don't get too hype
Laid back killer instances, killer track, make a snap re-mack
Bomb bandzee verses worse than crack, highly addictive

The microphone's the glass dick
And I'm smokin' smash hits, I need to be rehabilitated
And if I write to the beat that only
Makes the murder of the track premeditated

How dare you even look my way?
Better yet cross my path and have somethin' to say
You wack rapper don't you know who you fuckin' with
Niggas suck my dick, June'll be the first to bust your shit

Word up, get yourself hurt up, meanin' fast
The first one that steps be the first one I click-click-blast
Hit 'em one time up in his brain
But didn't kill 'em, I left him mentally insane

It be bloodstains on the sidewalk from thugs postin'
Animosity towards me will get you toasted
6 million ways, 365 days, I be on the street, crime pays
Nicks, Dimes and Treys used to be my hustle

Until I learned how to grab heat
And take it with the muscle
And rush you and pin you to the wall quickly
I'm shifty, low down dirty and gritty

All my brothers, what?
Let the world know it's hot
All the ladies

Can you feel us all up in your swat?
Can't touch the God lyrical far from typical style
Thirsty niggas couldn't drink if they walk a hundred miles
Broke thousands of clones in half, bones left in paths

Casualty, SI be I soulful by the craft
Divine self Allah, the golden mic holder
Got this whole shit locked like the Ayatollah
Rebel sink to levels as low as the devils
But the God made dirt to dig they grave with the shovel

Try to slay the master, his heart rate beats faster
Assault and battery make it hard to remember
Behold, I the black avenger
Black as charcoal with a soul as cold as December

Timber, lumberjack raps that can injure
And disappear in a cloud of smoke like a ninja
Great pretender, now it's time to deal with what's real
War, four score with a hundred raw niggas

You wanna play the game of life and throw his life on the line
With these tank slang niggas, hundred percent genuine
Mental court got niggas doin' time and
Frustration got me ready to do crime

Watch me shine like a comet
Orally smack niggas on the ground like they vomit
Frontin' all them years you need to stop it
You see who comin', the rightful owners of this era
Who show the love but if necessary bring the terror

Self defense and retaliation, hold this fort
Throw them niggas off the court in this rap sport
Your center's too short, your forwards' is backpedalin'
Your God's ain't hard, how you think you better than

Niggas with a plan who stand behind thoughts
Made known, reality show the grain blow
All over, universally consume your town like fire
Blaze the shit 'til we retire

All my brothers, what?
Let the world know it's hot 9, 7, what?
Shaolin take it to the top all the ladies
Show some love sugar, it's on tonight
Keepin' the party tight, aight

All my brothers, what?
Let the world know it's hot 9, 7, what?
Shaolin take it to the top all the ladies
Show some love sugar, it's on tonight
Keepin' the party tight, aight

All the ladies, can you feel it in your
All my niggas, let the world know it's hot 9, 7
Shaolin take it to the top
We keep the party tight, aight
