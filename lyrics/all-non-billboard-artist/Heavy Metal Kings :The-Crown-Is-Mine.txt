The-Crown-Is-Mine:Heavy Metal Kings 
I'm the numerical value of death
9 double-M, shallow lead and explosives
Powder keg that engulf and devour men
South of Heaven in the mouth of madness

Shoutin' at the casket, these idiots is drownin' in the vastness
My science is accurate while your favorite rappers be dyin' by accident
In the closet like David Carradine
Who the last man standin', who survive?
How can a man that stand on top of the water be crucified?

I never been the type to throw stones in glass houses
I'd rather throw lightnin' bolts and terrorize thousands
Make it happen when I lace the captain
Ran up in the Chase Manhattan
You can't see my face, I'm maskin', now taste my ratchet

It's the cult leader, the Isa, Mohammed of terror
Every mornin' wake up and see god in the mirror
The truth-speaker, I'm the universal chronicle bearer
Like Charles Manson being interviewed by Geraldo Rivera

The crown is mine

This is Heavy Metal Kin's, hard body shit, sniffin' white
I'm concerned with dyin', y'all are concerned with livin' life
I'm in the Church of Anton while y'all are kissin' Christ
You ain't fuckin' around with Billy or with Vincent Price

I have love for distance, I am the resistance
I am godly while y'all are just lackin' some specifics
I study bullet trajectory, it's my love for physics
Chicken ain't got nothin' to do with my love for biscuits

I am cancerous, everythin' that's around me dies
I am scandalous, everythin' that comes out me lies
I believe that you got weaponry but I doubt the size
You won't see me on anythin', I'm pokin' out your eyes

A bunch of John Wayne Gacys, fuckin' clowns
Any of y'all that don't embrace me, knuckle down
I don't fuck with small pay, at least a couple pounds
I don't need 12 to trash y'all, give me a couple rounds
