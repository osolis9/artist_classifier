THINKIN:Adrian Marcel
I've been (ive been)
Dreaming (dreaming)
About you all day
You make me believe in true love again

Girl i really want you
Do you really want me
Cause i think about all the things
We could really be
What you feel about us
Cause girl you could trust
That i'm gonna give you everything
Baby you can guarantee
cause we've been textin everyday
Calling, we've been talking till we got no words to say
All i wanna know is are you thinkin
What i've been thinkin
Thinkin we could be just more than friends
Woaahh
Tell me that we'll be just more than friends

The way we vibin
I want you always
Girl don't, fight it
My flags are down

Girl i really want you
Do you really want me
Cause i think about all the things
We could really be
What you feel about us
Cause girl you could trust
That i'm gonna give you everything
Baby you can guarantee
cause we've been textin everyday
Calling, we've been talking till we got no words to say
All i wanna know is are you thinkin (think of me, do you think?)
What i've been thinkin
Thinkin we could be just more than friends
