Girlfriend:Amil
Uh, yeah
It's like, I don't know what to do
I mean, what should I do?
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah

See I've got lil' secret
But I don't think I could keep it
Now when you first stepped to me
Didn't think you wanted to do me
Started takin' me to dinner and the movies
Had me open off the minks and jewelry
Buyin' me things that you know I wanted
Beggin' me for lovin' and you know I fronted

Now we doin' more then gettin' blunted
And we both know we shouldn't have done it
Because wifely at home and that's a no, no
How we gonna keep this on the low, low?
Try to let got but the trickin' won't stop
Feels so good baby please don't stop
I'm not tryin' to disrespect her
But everybody know what's up except her

See I'm gone tell your girlfriend
That you been doin' more than flirtin'
Where you at when you say, you workin'
I'm gone tell your girlfriend

I know I'm not the only one clamin' you
Your girl did a good job trainin' you
She could feed the kids and wash the clothes
She could cook dinner and mop the floors
Just keep givin' me a lot of doe
And give me some lovin' before you gotta go
Once you get home your girl be beefin'
Wonderin' where you was this weekend

Her cousin told her that she seen us creepin'
I guess by now she know you cheatin'
She must of found my number 'cause she callin' me
Couldn't talk 'cause her man was all in me
Told her call me back at a quarter to three
Now that's the way real players ought to be
Shall I tell her bout the she ordered me
So why you fuckin' with him? 'Cause he can afford me

See I'm gone tell your girlfriend
That you been doin' more than flirtin'
Where you at when you say, you workin'
I'm gone tell your girlfriend

It was the money that made me get with you
Right now I'm tryin' to get rid of you
'Cause you always at my house, like I live with you
Wanna lock me down, like I got kids with you
See I knew from the gate that you was taken
If I told you that I loved you, I was only faken
Shit it ain't like that I wanna keep you
But I'll beep you when I need you

Now who gettin' played better you than me
'Cause I know you could never be true to me
If you did it to her, you could do it to me
Start slippin' and you might be losin' me
Fuck gettin' hair done and a manicure
That's for beginner bitches and amateurs
I want a house on the beach, couple whips and more
Motherfucker now you know what major coins stand for

See I'm gone tell your girlfriend
That you been doin' more than flirtin'
Where you at when you say, you workin'
I'm gone tell your girlfriend

See I'm gone tell your girlfriend
That you been doin' more than flirtin'
Where you at when you say, you workin'
I'm gone tell your girlfriend
