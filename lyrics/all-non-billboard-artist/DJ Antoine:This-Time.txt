This-Time:DJ Antoine
Just lay your eyes on
The night
Don't you stay there
Don't you

Seems like the world is
The same
Right just as before

Why don't we step out
Of line
Let's just have a
Good time
Forget about the
To do's
And open the doors

This time
You should take me away
To a new place
Where we just might
Keep the night on the sky

This time
We'll be crossing the lines
Turn you somewhere new
Let's do it this time
This time, This time

We keep on hitting
The road
No excuses
No roots
We still are shown from
The moon
And don't you say no

We stop at nothing
At all
Take a chance now
Right now
'Cause now I'm losing
Control
I'm ready to go

This time
You should take me away
To a new place
Where we just might
Keep the night on the sky

This time
We'll be crossing the lines
Turn you somewhere new
Let's do it this time
This time

This time
This time
Ohh this time
Ohh
To the night on the sky
Ohh

Just lay your eyes on
The night
Don't you stay there
Don't you

Seems like the world is
The same
Right just has before

We stop at nothing
At all
Take a chance now
Right now
'Cause now I'm losing
Control
I'm ready to go

This time
You should take me away
To a new place

Where we just might
Keep the night on the sky

This time
We'll be crossing the lines
Turn you somewhere new
Let's do it this time
This time

This time
You should take me away

This time
This time
