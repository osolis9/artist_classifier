Sometimes-I-Get-Lonely:Time
Hey girl, when are you comin' back?
Don't know what I'm supposed to do, to fill this emptiness.
Never thought I'd miss you, but this feelin' I can't hide.
It comes in the middle of the day and it stays through the night.

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I get lonely. - When it's late at night.
I think of you only. - When I want to hold somebody tight.
Sometimes I get lonely. - And filled with emptiness.
Sometimes I get lonely. - For love.

Baby, let me slow this thing down.
Think I need a change of pace, think I'll spread myself around.
There's only so much time in a day, and I've got things to do baby.
So I'm not gonna spend my time waiting on you.

Sometimes I get lonely. - You better come home.
I think of you only. - When I want to hold somebody tight.
Sometimes I get lonely. - And filled with emptiness.
Sometimes I get lonely. - For love.

[Chorus]

You're leavin' home. - So when you're leavin' home?
Call me. - And you're not comin' right back.
Just let me know, so I can find some happiness, somewhere else.

So what's it gonna be baby?
I think it's about time you start thinkin' about me.
Oooh, don't make me wait baby.
If you know what I'm talkin' about. Fellas, help me out.

Sometimes I get lonely. - Hey girl.
I think of you only. - When I want to hold... hold you.
Sometimes I get lonely. - And filled with emptiness, hey girl.
Sometimes I get lonely. - For love.

[Chorus]

Sometimes I get lonely. - Baby, you don't know how it feels when it's late at night.
I think of you only. - When I wanna hold you, when I wanna squeeze you tight.
Sometimes I get lonely. - Tonight I'm lonely.
Sometimes I get lonely. - For love, for love.

If you want to please me, please don't tease me. - Don't make me wait girl.
If you want to please me, please don't tease me. - I want to hold your body tight.
If you want to please me, please don't tease me. - So what's it gonna be baby?.

Sometimes I get lonely...
