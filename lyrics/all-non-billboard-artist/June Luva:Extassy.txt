Extassy:June Luva
[June Luva]
I got six muthafuckas in the back with glocks
That's six mutahfuckas that'll blast the cops
Stapletown, Broad Street, that's the fastest spot
You can catch me in the carter slinging massive rocks
Blueberry Nike Air's with the matching watch
Only thing she know about me is I flash alot
I like big booty bitches, when they asses drop
Skin 'em out of tight jeans, watch they asses pop
God damn, good googa mooga
I fucks wit you mami, you can be my hood booga
I treat you like the queen you are, not a hooker
Literally baby, I be fucking good to ya
Get it, got it, now move on
I ain't the type to crowd a bitch, get ya groove on
Hey, now back at the Jux station
Same shit, different day, is what my niggas in the hood's facing
Now tune in next week, my wifey walks in the house
And caught me getting brain from some next freak
My ratings is so hot, this nigga is so fly
And all the mami's wanna give me chocha
Oh I, am that nigga named June
When I want a vacation, I drips to Cancun
Me and Rah might dip the grains tune
Scoop up a couple of shorty's, bang zoom

[Chorus: June Luva (girl)]
You wanna get next to me? (yeah daddy)
Well here go my ecstasy (ooh yeah)
You wanna get next to me? (yeah daddy)
Well here go my ecstasy (ooh yeah)
(Here go my ecstasy, here go my ecstasy)
(Here go my ecstasy, here go my ecstasy)

I'm on fire, your sex is like a drug mami and it's taking me
Higher, I'm so selfish I don't really want nobody else to
Try her, no, good God you make a playa like me wanna
Retire, lord lord, look what you done started
If anybody fuck with you, they dearly departed
I stomp a muthafucking hole in they carvin
I'm from the projects, nigga, now get retarded
You don't really wanna do that, you don't wanna die
You don't really want me all up in your face, right
Niggas like you get kidnapped and hog tied
Hope because you didn't know I was the wrong guy
To fuck with, muthafucka bust this, I bust clips
And leave a nigga in the dust quick
So go 'head wit ya bad ass, cuz tonight's not your night
We can knuckle up a fight
Or we can be up in the crowd, rubbing a dyke
Hon', her girlfriend just popped a pill wit a Sprite, let's go

[Chorus]
