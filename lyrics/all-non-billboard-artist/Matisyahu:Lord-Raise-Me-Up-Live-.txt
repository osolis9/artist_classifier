Lord-Raise-Me-Up-Live-:Matisyahu
Said I been gone for so long where my mind been at
wont you please wake me up wont you please bring me back
daydream fantasy and my mind went to sleep
eyes closed up from you with my heart heavy
so wont you please wake me up and shake me up and take me up said babylon will make me shock wave yes I had enough
so open up and lift the gates redemption coming like a run away truck
op! diggy do-do-do, you make my heart want to serve you and I'm bound to erupt you lift me up from quick sand in a world gone corrupt no longer stuck up up and away we go Yerushalayim is our home
(said lord raise me up from the ground I've been here so long I said lord raise me up from the ground) bass man!

When it started it'd be etched into my brain elevation
the shield that david blazed, into my brain waves
and i'm raisin' my soul like a sword in ancient days
when protection surrounded me like the sun's rays
Started it'd be etched into my brain elevation
the shield that david blazed, into my brain waves
and i'm Raisin' my soul like a sword in ancient days
when protection surrounded me Like the sun's rays
