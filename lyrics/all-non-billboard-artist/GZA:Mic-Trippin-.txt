Mic-Trippin-:GZA
Mic trippin', from rock skipping
Off the local brooks, not knowing
Heavy weight, throwin' vocal hooks
Rhymin' off Apache, the Rza scratch thee
Records borrowed from Home Alone kid known as latchkey

Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics
Forty-fives marked up, looped with static
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, trucks Chevy
Flare ripped from the magic lair, of medley

But deadly I merge forward, with a sharp spear
He must return now his flight departs here
Like Sittin' Bull, I lay with my bow pulled
Arrow poisonous cos my enemy clip's full

Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life paroles
Half the crowd wild, 9 M&M; holders
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulder

Many-a-die for fame movin' like Leroy
Can't be one and the same, nah it ain't b-boy
The decoy, scan this with high tech radar
'Til my mic strike, leave a state-size crater

I came into this with the writer's block
To prevent a sudden shock, on a large flock
Clips are uncut episode, invincible armor
I blaze one, once I struck the match off my bomber

Adjust this, 'til it's EQ'ed like never
Watch a mega watt bang spot, raise the lever
It's operation cobra, it's over
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier

My rough cut metal tapes, quick to break labelmates
Won't hesitate to negotiate your table stake
First lesson came from the session, room one
From the longest awaited, but the strongest made it
Complex, complicated, compressed elongated

Homicidal sub-title, Wu claw banga off the ocean shore
Kid jaw, cut with the jig-saw
Intern engineer, vest on the youth
Make the mic booth bulletproof from sparked wires

From autofire, rapid from the verbalist slangster's gat
Two hit Tucker she labeled it gangstar rap
Unseen heard, struck the vital nerves
Of some sort, courts got papers to serve

Still bang 'em in the head, just lead no eraser
One shot, no chaser, who gonna replace her
You punch-drunk swingin' your keys on your index
Showin' off your Rolex

Didn't see the Joe text, you filmed it on bolex
Smashed with the largest full finger name ringer, life clinger

Adjust this, 'til it's EQ'ed like never
Watch a mega watt bang spot, raise the lever
It's operation cobra, it's over
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier

Adjust this, 'til it's EQ'ed like never
Watch a mega watt bang spot, raise the lever
It's operation cobra, it's over
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier
