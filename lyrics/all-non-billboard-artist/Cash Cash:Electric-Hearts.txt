Electric-Hearts:Cash Cash
Is it over yet? We should spend the week in bed
'Cause all your wrongs are wrong and you can't make 'em right
Was it all a dream 'cause you're finally breaking free
We're gonna feel the rush coming over us tonight
'Cause we're going, going, gone

Throw your hands to the sky like you're flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
Hot, hot like a fire when electric hearts collide

We're gonna crash around till we wake this whole damn town
We're gonna flip the switch and plug it in
And when you lose control, when your beating heart explodes
Your gonna scream along to every song we sing to you
'Cause we're going, going, gone

Throw your hands to the sky like you're flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
Hot, hot like a fire when electric hearts

Throw your hands to the sky like you're flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
Hot, hot like a fire when electric hearts, electric hearts

We're gonna take your breath away
You're gonna scream the pain away
And try your luck again, be strong, don't bend
Just give it all we can and do it again

Throw your hands to the sky like you're flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
Hot, hot like a fire when electric hearts

Throw your hands to the sky like you're flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
Hot, hot like a fire when electric hearts

Throw your hands to the sky like you're flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
Hot, hot like a fire when electric hearts, electric hearts
When electric hearts collide
