Ain-t-the-Devil-Happy:Jeru the Damaja
As devils search for the secrets to immortality
I alter my physical chemistry
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I exist even when no things are left

Vibrations transcend space and time
Pure at heart because I deal with the mind
That's why I compose these verses
Audible worlds, my thoughts are now universes

Written on these pages is the ageless
Wisdom of the sages, ignorance is contagious
So I hope you keep your focus
There's no hocus-pocus, in the end, it's just us

Devil got brother killin' brother, it's insane
Goin' out like Abel and Cain, wisen up and use your brain
There'll be no limit, to the things that you can gain
In positivity, balance it with negativity
Until then, ain't the devil happy

I hate when the devil's happy, so I wear my hair hair nappy
Knotty, won't go out like John Gotti
He came from the caves to destroy everybody
And we like fools destroy our own bodies

Too many niggaz chillin', bad boys boom, boom
This leaves no room for the flowers to bloom
Seeds blow in the wind, another drug killing
What, are we accomplishing? Nothing

What's, the matter?
Why every time I look around another brain gets splattered?
Some pockets get fatter but it don't matter
The devil's the only one who really gets fatter

Lead ruptures flesh, spleens are shattered
Dreams are shattered, another queen without a king
What will out children become without proper guidance?
Probably nothing, so ain't the devil happy

Niggaz are in a state of nothingness
Hopelessness, lifelessness
If you're in range I hope you hear this
And try to change this, 'cause it's disastrous

Who gets the most loot, who gets bust?
Dollar bill y'all, is the God we trust
The days blow by like dust
Even Men of Steel rust

We're out here acting ridiculous
When, only we can save us
Mentally enslave us, for little or nothing kill our neighbors
Animalistic, canibalistic behavior

Look to the sky for your savior
He won't save ya, he didn't save your forefathers
Why bother, brothers? You must discover
The power of self, know thyself or find thyself

Hating thyself, killing thyself
While he collects the wealth
That you sit back and murder for
Ain't the devil happy
