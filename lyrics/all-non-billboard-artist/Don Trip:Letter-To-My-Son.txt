Letter-To-My-Son:Don Trip
You took away the sound
The touch, the smell
My sight to see your smile
Oh

Please, no pity for a G
Though I got a son that I barely get to see
I see him for a hour, after that, he gotta leave
And on top of that I only get to see him once a week

Yeah, right, lucky me
Well, fuck Keltra Pope and whoever disagree
I learned a valuable lesson indeed
But I'm just trying be the best father I could be

Apparently I'm a unfit father
'Cause all I know about is dope and all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm selling dope to help my family get farther
'Cause no 9-5 is gon' prevent us from starving

I'm sorry Jalen, I don't get to see you like I want to
I just wanna let you know I want to
If the court grant me visitation then I'm going to
But you too young to understand what we goin' through

And your momma low down
She just doing everything to hurt me right now
Why? 'Cause I don't love her like I use to
So to get back at me she know she got to use you

And I don't know what else to do
She don't understand it, this shit will bruise you too
And now I gotta take the bitch to court
So either way it's a lose, lose

I'm writing a letter to my baby
I'm writing a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over, it's not done

I told your mama I don't love her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'ma be the bad one, I'ma be the bad one
But I just wanna see my son

I tried talking to the bitch
But she keep using you as a bargaining chip
And I am not the one to be bargaining with
That just make me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch

I swear this shit ain't even right, bruh
I ain't even got the chance to change your fucking diaper
This is what I get for going raw when I piped her
Thinking that I loved her when I shouldn't have even like her

But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch, I just wanna see my child
Do what you may but you will never make me bow
Fuck child support, bitch, take me to trial

Why you with this shit 'cause I ain't read you no vows?
Bitch, move on me and you ain't working out
So what's it matter that I moved to work out
Long as I provide and put food in his mouth

I'm writing a letter to my baby
I'm writing a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over, it's not done

I told your mama I don't love her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'ma be the bad one, I'ma be the bad one
But I just wanna see my son

Matter of fact, I'm in school right now
'Case the music don't work and I can put the work down
My momma say this shit sure to work out
All the bullshit I'm going through to see my first child

See his first steps, see his first smile
Hear his first words, teach him how to count
But I guess I've been counted out
Seeing as the bitch don't want me around

When I speak to him, he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice so he just looks around
I know she enjoys so I suck it up and smile
But fuck the stupid, bitch, I just wanna see my child

I'm writing a letter to my baby
I'm writing a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over, it's not done

I told your mama I don't love her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'ma be the bad one, I'ma be the bad one
But I just wanna see my son
