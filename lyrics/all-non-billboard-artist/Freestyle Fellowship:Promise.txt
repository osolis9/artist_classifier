We Are The Light.
People
Light up your light tonight
I wanna see you shine

Fight despair
Don’t let it get you down
Don’t let it tie you down

There’s a man with a wife and three children
Who’s been told he can’t work
There’s a boy who’s been told there’s no future
He’s been led by the blind.

And i can hear them crying
As they try to sleep through the night
I can hear them cry
I can hear them cry

We are the light
We are the light
We are the light of our lives

Hold on
To what you believe is right
Don’t let anyone turn your eyes
Look ahead
Don’t stop to look behind
The past ain’t no friend of mine
There’s a failure who is standing on the corner
For he cannot see hope
There’s a blind man who is standing at the crossroads
For he cannot see light

And as we fire the candles
We must make sure they burn through the night
For if they should die
There’d be no light

We are the light
We are the light
We are the light of our lives
We are the light
We are the light of our lives
Shine your light
Shine your light
Shine your light
Shine
Shine your light
Shine your light
Shine your light
Shine

We are the light
Shine on, shine on shine
We are the light
