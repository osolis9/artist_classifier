Windows:Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment
[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today

[Break: Raury]
Careful
Careful
Careful

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper, Raury, & BJ the Chicago Kid]
No no no no no no no no no no
Careful
Careful
Don't trust a word I say
Careful (Careful)
Careful
Don't trust a word I say
Careful
If you learn one thing today (Yeah, yeah, yeahhhh)

Careful (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Be careful (Careful)

Don't you don't you don't you
Don't be so careful
Don't trust a word I say
