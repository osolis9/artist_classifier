Teenage-Parasite:Pistol
I haven't seen your face in days
Well I don't care where you've been
Sometimes I think I miss the misery
When I put the blame, the blame on you

I know I was wrong
I fell in love with a teenage parasite

Hey, hey, hey

She's been sleeping with my friends again
Just like a dog, dog in heat
And when you come thrown back to me
I'm gonna kick you when you're down

I know I was wrong
I fell in love with a teenage parasite
I know I was wrong
I fell in love with a teenage parasite

I love you, hate you, love you
And you're killing me
Can you taste it, taste it, taste it?
When you beg me please
Liar

I haven't seen your face in days
Well I don't care where you've been
Sometimes I think I miss the misery
When I put the blame, the blame on you

I know I was wrong
I fell in love with a teenage parasite
I know I was wrong
I fell in love with a teenage parasite

Teenage, Teenage parasite
Teenage, Teenage parasite
Teenage
