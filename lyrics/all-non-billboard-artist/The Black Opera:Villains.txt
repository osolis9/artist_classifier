Villains:The Black Opera
Murder was the case that they gave me
The block got a nigga goin’ crazy
It ain’t been the same since the 80’s
Shit, we trying make a million
They plotting and they stealing
We trying to raise our children
They robbing and they killin. the villains
Guilty to proven innocent?
Now everybody wanna know, who’s the real villains?
Who’s the stealers of the show?
Shoot to kill squealers stay revealin on the low
Asking who’s in it? hit em with the willis younger bro (nigga what u talkin bout?)
Now as the story unfolds
Flags at memorials. glory gets told
Passed at the crossroads: warriors. soldiers
Before the sunrise in the morning it’s cold
Got the sparrows eye on us
The barrels eye pointing, tryin to paralyze the movement. paradise ruined
Them niggas is the real mass murderers
Rockin a mask permanent but we just tryin to live
See they committin a string of violence
Attachin our name to it, now the beast is tryin to pin us
But we can’t be pinned shawn carter verse
Peter parkers versus spidermen we the darker version
Journalists’ false verbiage got a nigga ‘noid
Kinda nervous, psycho, writin that sigmund freud
So catch us if you can but we not hidin
You see us every time you’re blinkin right behind your eyelids
Murder was the case that they gave me
The block got a nigga goin’ crazy
It ain’t been the same since the 80’s
Shit, we trying make a million
The villains
They plotting and they stealing
The villains
We trying to raise our children
The villains
They robbing and they killin. the villains
Guilty to proven innocent?
Yo, it’s the black op era
Black shakra. I shock rarer
They shock value like a copperhead. I strike terror
Assault and battery a copper-heli, heli-copters in the monster’s belly
That’s the sound of the beast
Still screaming fuck the police, middle finger to the sky
Motherfuck the police
Never singing to the spies
Was told i’m born to die by those who said I wasn’t born to vote
No cornucopia: just hoes and dope
But, don’t abort him. let him go to war
We lower than hell is on the totem pole
They trying to make us ghost with pills and coke: such a deadly blow
But, i'mma die harder than viagra strokes
My niggas feel me when I pen the sickness
They trying to pen my sickness on genetics like eugenics, cause of my mental illness
I got a beef with they ‘biology’ like zeitgeist
They trynna paint my society with white lies
African to caucasian: red, brown to yellas
Don’t ask me if i’m racist: just combine the colors
It’s the black operation motherfucker
It’s the black operation motherfuckers
Murder was the case that they gave me
The block got a nigga goin’ crazy
It ain’t been the same since the 80’s
Shit, we trying make a million
They plotting and they stealing
We trying to raise our children
They robbing and they killin. the villains
Guilty to proven innocent?
