Kneecap-Jelly:Georgia Anne Muldrow
Digging deep before a change
That i can trust forever
Took it by try to fight the first one clever
See the window sheet my familiar window shadow
Picking pieces up with bar hands made me much better
Common knowledge say an USA president can’t save you
Everywhere I turn a mental war and seeks to slave you
Sins crack for those who made the choice to make the party
Movement .. safe and sorry
I am one and I am for directions on this wheel of life
It is wise to .. all god’s children on this wheel we ride
Fine clothes that affects put danger on your body
But what is danger in a battle field with no quality

Isn’t go things strictly by love want the freedom guilty
Is a reality i feel deep inside me
Why the .. why they are so afraid to tell me
We are so much bigger than we think we are
Or extorted stress being soul …expanded
.. human .. senseless .. I am a boys
Descended form the ones who lived the wild
Don’t ever say i don’t have the right to sit and talk about it
.. before directions is .nature be about it
The mercy we all seek will come when our hearts will respond
I am one and I am for directions on this wheel of life
It is wise to .. all god’s children on this wheel we ride
