Meh:Red Pill
duction]
And we admire that creature
Because it's in line to do
Exactly what it wants to do
I told you I'm not a guru
I'm not a leader
I drink my wine
I play the horses
And it's like Homes
Thats all there is
I have nothing to say about anything
There is nothing to say
The less I say
The better I stand

I guess I'm just bored
Another Rap album
I had a dream:
You and another woman
Were loving me in ways I'll probably never know
Winter time and there's evergreens
And the Walgreens
Got the Christmas music
Playing "Let it Snow"
And I'm reminded of the time
You tried to let me go
Because of the way I tend to let depression show
I asked you to take the Chicken out the freezer
To defrost it
But you must not have got the message though
So I'm scouring the fridge
As if standing in front of it
Don't make something edible exist
But only noodles and butter
And I'm a picky motherfucker
Kinda prissy and piss-y about my hunger

Been in this city too long
For something new to be discovered
So, I'm calling Happy's
(so) what's the number
Make it a large with pepperoni
And banana peppers
And side of cheese bread
With the ranch dressing

I guess I'm just bored
I guess I'm just "meh"
I guess I want more
I guess I'm just "bleh"
I guess I'm "so-so"
I guess I'm doing fine
I guess I'm alright
Yes it is what it is

Spending hours on the internet
Studying how to get respect
Lucrative ways to get the checks
Seems to me I'm missing steps
Seems to be scenery that I didn't check
I know that you know that I'm broke and hopeless
I know that because I told you
The previous time that I spoke to you
But I just showed you
My mind was never broken open
Obligatory line about me smoking
Obligatory line about me drinking
Obligatory line about some job and overthinking
Obligatory line about some other shit
I don't know

Being obliged to be alive
Really I'm still a kid at 26
Who thinks the world is full of dicks
With the job he wants to quit
Really I'm scared as shit that I don't need to fear
Really I got to go because the pizza's here

I guess I'm just bored
I guess I'm just "meh"
I guess I want more
I guess I'm just "bleh"
I guess I'm "so-so"
I guess I'm doing fine
I guess I'm alright
Yes it is what it is
