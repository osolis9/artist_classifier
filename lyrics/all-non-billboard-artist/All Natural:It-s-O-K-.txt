It-s-O-K-:All Natural
When brothers who was once real get a record deal
Their poetry and prose start switching like hoes
Those who was once skilled try to go commercial
While other imbeciles attempt to immerse you
In fictional narratives that ain't that imperative
About things they never done and ways that they'll never live
While I work hard to keep my 9 to the 5
Cause I never relied on kickin' rhymes to survive
Cause rappers start thinking about selling units
That's when they fall victim to stale influence
Niggas be lying, cause they too lazy
To do for theyself, relying on true shady
Scheme for wealth, and plus they got a baby
Can't even help self, their seed, or their lady
It's crazy cause the same nigga chasing the dollar
Won't even consider the lifestyle of a scholar
But to escape the squalor he'll sell lala and wallabees
And open up his block's 20th beauty parlor
He's a sucker, infatuated with America
For Lucci all my children play theyself like Erica
I lyrically box brothers, who be on the box cutters
Can't even nick, when I kick the one two
And a, son it's magic, but tragic
The way you ride the Johnson
Like Bailey on the mic I'mma dust you with the daily
See a rhyme should be designed to make a brother use his mental
And force hip-hop to reach its fullest potential
So dummies come simple like Langston Hughes
I watch em kneel like Zora, and Tom like Cruise

It's OK, you ain't got to live the life of a thug
It's OK, you ain't got to rhyme about selling drugs
It's OK, you ain't got to fit a commercial niche
It's OK, you ain't got to call your sister no bitch
It's OK, you ain't got to play the role of the fool
It's OK, you can be dope and still finish school
It's OK, you ain't got to glorify what's wrong
It's OK, you ain't got to sample RnB songs

All these half-pint niggas is followers
They could never measure up to a liter, they be the
Same sorry negros who try to convey
That it's all good, nah brother, it's just OK
Now on the mic like a leper I leave people petrified
Rip a rappers rep and pride, and tell him step aside
Brothers running while we rushing like Pushkin
Attack like a push pin, I push pins cross the paper
But D be dodging the dotted, making grants
But holding off at the hancock
Getting grants and building up a fan block
Of hardcore heads who gotta see their man rock
So should a sucker their step to oppose us
The crowd might stone him to death like Moses
Crew'll kick a nigga smack dead in the ass crack
For trying to attack with weakass wisecracks
But me I just battle back with lyrical technique
More deadly than ass kick and letting a tech speak
The Capital, can't cap Capital's capital
So Capital gains and maintains a rapid flow
Of currency changing hands within the community
Now currently Polygram and Sony are suing me
But I passed the polygraph, these labels ain't screwing me
D ain't polygamous to polemic for politics
A sodomist's gonorrhea would burn like Sodom and Gomorrah
So we ain't a whore to companies for a quarter
Underground and independent, I'm a direct descendant
Of the first pioneer while suckers perspire fear
Hoping that they get re-signed for the next year
I stay at least a leg up on em like a pap-smear
Don't even rap near, Capital D, you best stand clear

It's OK, you ain't got to live a life a crime
It's OK, you ain't got to be a sucker to rhyme
It's OK, you ain't got to dance in your videos
It's OK, you ain't got to chill with 2 dollar hoes
It's OK, you ain't got to holler out keep it real
It's OK, you can be dope and kick what you feel
It's OK, you ain't got to wish that you was a star
It's OK, all you got to do is be who you are
It's OK, ya'll
It's OK

It's OK, you ain't got to live the life of a thug
You ain't got to rhyme about selling drugs
You ain't got to fit a commercial niche
And you ain't got to call your sister no bitch
You ain't got to play the role of the fool
You can be dope and still finish school
You ain't got to glorify what's wrong
And you ain't got to sample RnB songs
