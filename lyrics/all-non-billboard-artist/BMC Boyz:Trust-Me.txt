And have yo thinkn in ya mind that I'm only tryna fuck

And I know you probably thinkin yea right
But I'm tryna be ya man
And be the only nigga that you really need in ya life
Baby girl stop playin So baby girl stop playin
Cause I ain't tryna waste time, Cause I wanna make you mine
Yea I wanna make you mine, Baby girl stop playin
