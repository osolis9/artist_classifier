Every day I'm feenin' that she by my side
I never thought I'd
Meet a girl with gangsta feel and sex appeal
I love that feelin'
Hopin' I'm the one that she been waitin' for
And prayin' for she
Never wanna be anything else but herself
Never want help

I wanna creep deep down inside and make the heat rise
My life's no longer dark, from the glow in your eyes
I wanna be the first to take it
I could change ya life
Yeah
Oh!

When I sit and think about what we could be
It's like a dream; I
Promise I will never break your heart
I'll trust ya, learn to love ya
Every time I have a problem, she's right here
She's open ears; I
Call her every day to tell her that I miss her
Long to kiss her
(Whoo!)
(Oh!)

I wanna creep deep down inside and make the heat rise
My life's no longer dark, from the glow in your eyes
I wanna be the first to take it
I could change ya life
Yeah
Oh!

This girl makes me
Go on and on and on and on how the feeling's so strong
This girl makes me
Go on and on and on and on how we're gonna last so long
This girl makes me
Go on and on and on and on how I'll never be wrong
This girl makes me
Go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and

I just wanna tell her things I write and sing
I know she brings me
What I always wanted; that's that ride-or-die chick
She's that fly shit
Got me quittin' things; I thought I'd never try
Not gettin' high; I'm
Kinda soundin' crazy, but my baby
What a perfect lady
(Whoo!)
(Oh!)

I wanna creep deep down inside and make the heat rise
My life's no longer dark, from the glow in your eyes
I wanna be the first to take it
I could change ya life
Yeah
Oh!

Oh!
