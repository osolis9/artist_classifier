Illustrate:Verbal Kent
Illustrate, fill 'em with the hate that filled you

I told myself, "Time to illustrate
Fill 'em with the hate that filled you."
And if you like the message that fulfills you
No truer words were spoken or exchanged ever
Between me or another
I'll die by those words, a triumphant motherfucker
Cause living for myself takes precedence
And this body's where my own soul makes residence
Hound on that scent to make sense for dead presidents
Of cents slid ahead of said reverence
Redirect my rhetoric like Federer
The evidence left make peoples pupils dilated like if Evidence left
Come between me and my family, put a gun in your mouth
You ate/eight nine you right between seven and ten
You see me coming, better rise, no unleven bread
I fake independently, it's like I'm a Seven Head
I ride the beat you ride the seat right on the end of the bench
This could disconnect the neck right from the head of a witch

{x4}

You never knew I spit a rap that slapped and split a wig
I throw Hulk Hogan across a room like he's a Kristen Wiig
Kris Kringle at Hanukkah high off chronica
Hiding behind a candelabra, can't believe it's Monica's kid
Verbal first name, the worst thang to happen to the Earth came
Stealing the birthday
I think it was a Thursday
I'll cut your fucking head off and leave it in a bird cage
First leave you begging for first aid
Handing out personal earthquakes
Shake your soul out and now your body is my personal work space
Examining the fabric of life, the life scientist
Put my foot in your ass, it's shitty for podiatrists
Sci-Fi Channel, grip a handle and chill
My father saw when he analyzed the man that he built
All in in any hand he was dealt
Strip poker with the doctors at the board north of Andersonville
And Roger's Park

"Hack off the top of the head
Of the next wack off to rap wack off the top of the head"
