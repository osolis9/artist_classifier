They-re-Coming-to-Take-Me-Away-Ha-Haaa-Single:Napoleon XIV
Remember when you ran away
And I got on my knees and begged you
Not to leave because I'd go beserk?
Well!

You left me anyhow and
Then the days got worse and worse
And now you see I've gone completely
Out of my mind

And!

They're coming to take me away
Ha, ha, they're coming to take me away
Ho, ho, hee, hee, ha, ha
To the funny farm
Where life is beautiful all the time
And I'll be happy to see
Those nice young men
In their clean white coats
And they're coming to take me away
Ha, ha!

You thought it was a joke
And so you laughed! You laughed
When I had said that losing you
Would make me flip my lid!

Right?!

You know you laughed
I heard you laugh, you laughed
You laughed and laughed
And then you left
But now you know I'm utterly mad

And!

They're coming to take me away
Haha, they're coming to take me away
Ho, ho, hee, hee, ha, ha
To the happy home with trees and flowers
And chirping birds and basket weavers
Who sit and smile and
Twiddle their thumbs and toes
And they're coming to take me away
Ha, ha!

I cooked your food
I cleaned your house
And this is how you pay me back
For all my kind unselfish loving deeds?

Huh?!

Well, you just wait
They'll find you yet
And when they do, they'll put you in
The ASPCA, you mangy MUTT

And!

They're coming to take me away
Ha, ha, they're coming to take me away
Ho, ho, hee, hee, ha, ha
To the funny farm
Where life is beautiful all the time
And I'll be happy to see
Those nice young men
In their clean white coats
And they're coming to take me away
Ha, ha!

To the happy home with trees and flowers
And chirping birds and basket weavers
Who sit and smile and
Twiddle their thumbs and toes
And they're coming to take me away
Ha, ha!

To the funny farm
Where life is beautiful all the time
And I'll be happy to see
Those nice young men
