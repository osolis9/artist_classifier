Oh I, always try to save time
And in life, nothing works the same twice
You know jealousy, jealousy, jealousy is still a friend of mine
But it's got to be, got to be, got to be worth another try

'Cause when the feeling goes, and when I'm feeling no shame
And when you already know, and now it's getting close
And when the lights go on, I can see it all
In every single day, and I'm telling you now
I'm never far away
Never far away

So come on, stop it if you're wondering
There's no wrong, wrong in what we're doing
So stop it, stop it if you're wondering
I've got it all figured out
Just keep on doing what you're doing
And won't you turn it around (and around and around)

'Cause when the feeling goes, and when I'm feeling no shame
And when you already know, and now it's getting close
And when the lights go on, I can see it all
In every single day, and I'm telling you now
I'm never far away (never far away)
Never far away

Far away
Far away
Far away
Far away
Far away
Never far away (Far away)
Far away
Never far away (Far away)

So stop it, stop it if you're wondering
I've got it all figured out
Just keep on doing what you're doing
And won't you turn it around (and around and around)

'Cause when the feeling goes, and when I'm feeling no shame
And when you already know, and now it's getting close
And when the lights go on, I can see it all
In every single day, and I'm telling you now
I'm never far away
Never far away (and around and around)

'Cause when the feeling goes, and when I'm feeling no shame (Far away)
And when you already know, and now it's getting close (Far away)
And when the lights go on, I can see it all (Far away)
In every single day, and I'm telling you now (Far away)
I'm never far away (Far away)
Never far away (Far away)
