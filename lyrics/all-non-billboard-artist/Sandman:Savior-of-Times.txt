Savior-of-Times:Sandman
Quicksilver's running your veins
You've been tied all of your days
You think I'm just some guy in the line
But really I'm the God of new ages, are you blind?

With my blood red eyes I'm looking at you
When you are heading to your doom
We all know your fate
After all life ain't so great

When your life burns no one cares
When you die it's all right
Cause I'm the Savior of the Times

You've been kicked back in the shadows
And Garden of Eden is lying to you
Money in the pocket is your whole world
While you're crawling in the dirt

You better not mess around with me
Cause you'll never be like I've always been
Silver tears are running on the roses
While the golden river of your life is running out of it's sources

When your life burns no one cares
When you die it's all right
Cause I'm the Savior of the Times

When your life burns no one cares
When you die it's all right
Cause I'm the Savior of the Times

When your life burns no one cares
When you die it's all right
Cause I'm the Savior of the Times
