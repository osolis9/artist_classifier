StreetPlayer:Fiend
Street player
I prefer chips no salsa
Having no money is torture 
Streets change your life with one offer
Jump the.. on the block
People waiting at the altar..
..make the life harder
Possible to stay on the right track
…means that I still feel anything
From a small city, but my heart ain’t a little thing. 
..about a man, about a soul in the same street…
My soul went talking like a… 

Chorus: 
Street player (yeah, yeah you know me)
And I’m playing this song! 
Street player (yeah, yeah you know me)
And I’m playing this song!

Yeah, I got my passport on me 
Watch this flow,
But these boys is George Cloony
Keep a bad bitch like…

I don’t trust …
I only fuck with a few if ever on discussion
On this …yes, I’m tat dude
Deep in the deep freezer, too cool
Street player had a mind of a money… 
Turned up the dice game into Vegas
..telling how you make your way
Just jealousy wasted emotion and… 
..I don’t talk much, you don’t know me
I don’t need a… you don’t have to show me
My will got…
My life style over whores and I keep drunk
You ain’t get money, better get some!

Chorus: 
Street player (yeah, yeah you know me)
And I’m playing this song! 
Street player (yeah, yeah you know me)
And I’m playing this song!
Don’t you know my heart is sold
Will carry, carry on!
Carry on!
