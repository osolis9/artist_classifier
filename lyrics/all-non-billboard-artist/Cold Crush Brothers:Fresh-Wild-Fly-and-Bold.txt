Fresh-Wild-Fly-and-Bold:Cold Crush Brothers
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	Well, I'm fresh
Cause I'm the best
[ J.D.L. ]	And I get wild
When I'm row'
[ Eazy A.D. ]	I never get passed by
Cause I'm fly
[ Almighty K.G. ]	And I'ma put you on hold
Cause I'm bold
[ all ]	And Charley Chase will last
Cause he's fast
And Tony Tone got booked
Cause he's original
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	The Cold Crush is on
[ J.D.L. ]	Cause we perform
[ Eazy A.D. ]	And even in a storm
[ Almighty K.G. ]	We'll keep you warm
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	Hey crew
[ rest ]	Yeah, Cap?
We gonna need some scratching for this rap
Now Tone and Chase
[ Tony Tone & Charley Chase ]
Yeah crew?
[ all ]	You're the DJs, whatcha gonna do?

(r) (ro) (rock)

[ Grandmaster Caz ]	Guess what, y'all, I'm fresh
[ rest ]	(What makes you think so, Cap?)
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	Because I look so good, and I'm the lord of rap
[ rest ]	(How fresh?)
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	So fresh, that when I was young
I learned to drive women crazy with my tongue
[ rest]	(Now, that's fresh...)

[ J.D.L. ]	Yeah - well, I get wild
[ rest ]	(What makes you say that, L?)
[ J.D.L. ]	Because it don't take much to make me yell
[ rest ]	(How wild?)
[ J.D.L. ]	So wild, that when I start to break
Hey, you better step back and let me flake
[ rest ]	(Now, that's wild...)

[ Eazy A.D. ]	Well, I'm fly
[ rest ]	(Who told you that, Eazy?)
[ Eazy A.D. ]	Your girl, her mother, and my lady
[ rest ]	(How fly?)
[ Eazy A.D. ]	So fly, sometimes it seems
All I got to do is smile, and I get screams
[ rest ]	(Now, that's fly...)

[ Almighty K.G. ]	I'm bold
[ rest ]	(What gives you that impression, Kay?)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	Because I don't care what nobody say
[ rest ]	(How bold?)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	So bold, I smack a man with his gun
And kiss his woman, diss his mother, and don't even run
[ rest ]	(Now, that's bold...)

[ all ]	Fresh, wild, fly and bold
And we'll be that way till we grow old
For the rest of our lives, as long as we live
We'll keep using those adjectives
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	That do describe
The heart-breaking tribe
[ J.D.L. ]	That do permit
Us to go with
[ Eazy A.D. ]	A musical flow
That makes you say ho
[ Almighty K.G. ]	With a fresh rap style
To make you go wild
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	Cold Crush
[ J.D.L. ]	Us
[ Eazy A.D. ]	Deep in the cut
[ Almighty K.G. ]	And if you don't believe we're real
[ all ]	Then touch
Us
The Cold Crush

( *scratching* )

[ all ]	Fresh, wild, fly and bold
Yes, we're what makes the Crush so cold
Our rhymes will freeze all fake MCs
That don't say please before they cease
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	Rhymes and routines that we make up
[ J.D.L. ]	You can't pour juice in a fake cup
[ Eazy A.D. ]	They cannot rape
[ Almighty K.G. ]	So they just rob
[ all ]	But a biter can't do a real rapper's job
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	But if you're hard-headed, and you still think so
Grab your rhymes and your mic
[ all ]	And go for what you know

[ Almighty K.G. ]	My name is K.G
[ rest ]	(better known as the Al-)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	-mighty, and with the 3
[ rest ] (I'm sure you'll call)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	On us when your ear
[ rest ]	(is in need for a treat)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	And if you don't know, the K
[ rest ]	(that's who you got to meet)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	I'm 4th in line
[ rest ]	(and in due time)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	And every rapper in the business
[ rest ]	(will know that I'm)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	Serious about this
[ rest ]	(and I don't play)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	I told a sucker MC that
[ rest ]	(just the other day)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	Cause I learned the ropes
[ rest ]	(and paid my dues)
[ Almighty K.G. ]	I'm going for the gold
[ rest ]	(no way that I can lose)

[ Eazy A.D. ]	It's Eazy A.D. that you wanted to be
Ever since you saw me emcee
You wanted to be down to learn how to rhyme
Even wanted your braids as long as mine
But the rhymes I write are a real delight
If you're a true MC, you would not bite
On me or them, just sit down and
Write a rhyme with your mind, paper or pen
But you can't, so you go, you will and you won't
Take heed and feed and reap what I wrote

[ J.D.L. ]	When I'm on the stage I go a little berserk
Start breaking, flaking, you know I do work
I try to get you on mine when I deliver my lines
Cause it's about making rhymes like no one else can design
I do everything I can to make myself better
Live on a steady diet of stages and ???
Know all the celebs, so when I'm in the crowd
They surround me like the press, scream my name out loud
Say
[ rest ]	Yo J.D.L
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	What's happenin'?
[ J.D.L. ]	Where have you been?
[ Almighty K.G. ]	When are you rocking again?
[ J.D.L. ]	And when I'm bopping away, I hear a lot of them say
"Goddamn, I wanna be like the L one day"

[ Grandmaster Caz ]	So many biting MCs, you're all a pain in my neck
They should be sending me your royalty check
You just bit my rhymes, didn't pay no tax
Copied the music from someone else, put it on wax
I'm mad as hell, cause it's bound to sell
And you be biting what I'm writing, and people can't tell
You change it around, disguise the sound
With no prior desire to write, that's why I frown
On those of you that don't try to
Be original and write like the Captain do
So put your teeth away, and try someday
And you can quote it, cause I wrote it only yesterday

[ all ]	Fresh!
[ Grandmaster Caz ]	And unless I miss my guess
I'm the best, oh yes, because I wrote the test
[ all ]	Wild!
[ J.D.L. ]	Honey child on the top of the pile
Once in a while I crack a smile
[ all ]	Fly!
[ Eazy A.D. ]	Know why? Cause to the day I die
I'll always be the guy you won't pass by
[ all ]	Bold!
[ Almighty K.G. ]	So cold and so hard to hold
[ all ]	And when they made the Cold Crush, they broke the mold
Hah-huh!

Man, let's get outta here, it's Miller time
Word!
Huh!
Hah! (hah)
