Sober:Lorde
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight

Oh god I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move along with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see every
Ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
Ah ha

We're King and Queen of the weekends
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekends
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?

Oh God I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor, wet
Limelight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
Their bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart
Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive
When we get dark

But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
Ah ha

We're King and Queen of the weekends
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekends
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?

Damn it, we’re fading
Till daylight, we’re jaded
We know that it’s over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
Oh, dancing with us, oh, dancing with us
(Can you feel it, can you, can you)
Dancing with us, us
But what will we do when we're sober?

When you get to my high
When you get to my-
