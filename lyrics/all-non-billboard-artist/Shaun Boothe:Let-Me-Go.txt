Let-Me-Go:Shaun Boothe
And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

 Let's go!

 And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go

 Glasses up high, I'm a raise two up
 Live it to the fullest, my nigga, that's how we grew up
 Buzz like a crew cut
 I just wanna fly
 Take me thru the sky
 Put me in a different zone
 I got this one girl and I call her my Medusa
 She ain't that pretty but she always get me stoned
 So let it rain, let it rain
 I can't make the weather change
 So I'm rollin' up the perfect getaway
 I dedicate this to better days
 Couldn't be in a better daze
 And I seen good times, I seen bad times
 But I ain't seen much in between
 And so I celebrate and I self medicate
 And I never want this feelin' to leave
 Don't let me go!

 And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go
 And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go
 And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go (Hold up)
 Don't you let me go, let me go

 Drowning my blues in dark liquor
 Nothing soothes the heart quicker
 We party on, party on
 If you don't party hard, you party wrong
 I'm doin' me my nigga, me my nigga, me
 I just wanna be free, I just wanna be
 In my oasis, my champagne supernova
 And roll up and roll up til I induce a coma
 And float up and float up, I'll see you when I'm sober
 Feet up on my foot stool, I'm to' up
 They say you so much smarter sober but so what
 I got my whole life to grow up
 And if it takes the edge off I don't mind being less sharp
 Sometimes that's the best part
 I'm doin' me my nigga, me my nigga, me my nigga, me
 Don't let me go!

 And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go
 And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go
 And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
 Don't you let me go, let me go (Hold up)
 And don't you let me go, let me go
