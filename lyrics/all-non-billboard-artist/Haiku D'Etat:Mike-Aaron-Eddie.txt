M-M-M-My name is Mikah and I'm rockin' the mic,
k-k-k-kinda psycho like a meteorite,
on the m-m-microphona, no m-m-my Sharona,
no b-o-l-o-g-n-a, no b-b-b-bologna,
M-M-Michael Michael mo Michael, bo feeble fible bo fichael,
I'm psycho, survival for rivals depends if I use my rifle,
stifle us down, while I'm lettin' off rounds,
people hurrying, hurling, hurdling, hitting the ground,
m-i-c, r-o-p, h-o-n-e, movin' many,
M-i-k-e, ok say ok, he capable of reducing the levels of treble,
rebel with horrible trouble, kibbles and bits in my hits,
dribbles and drips from your lips, and clips, you slip,
you're in the dark, skip important parts,
forget the way the rhyme starts, how smart
now 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8
I'm takin' out anyone trying to break up on the microphone because I know they fake,
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P
P is for power for takin' out cowards who trying to scour the One and only
Mikah 9, I like to rhyme,
anytime anyday, when I recite, I shine,
I smoke the kine, finally I'm gettin' mine,
my name you'll find, on the marquee, there's a big line,
wrappin' around the corner, we run California,
Haiku d'Etat on the sign

Life, life, life, life is the man with the mic in his hand,
that's Silence, the lamb getting all the guidance,
he can, he don't got to lie to his fans,
I don't have to pilot the planes of the style in the same,
you better file in the lanes, chain gang no weak link in our armor,
maintain free speech in our honor, day-to-day golden rule to good karma,
hold a full account of all that we was all the way through the Coup de mantanka
penalize, rigorize, 'til they see the light realized,
think with a seeing eye, relief cuz money ain't the key to life,
it's love and our existence is a symphony of epiphanies,
above and beyond our experiences are mysteries,
the blood of our ancestors all through history enriches me,
I channel victory, my instincts are so defensive,
my Haiku co-dependents, we fight 'til the photofinish,
Ab Rude put the soul up in it, case 1 is the poet waiting,
I can honestly jazz him, razz-mattazzle-dazzling,
don't even think about battling, this could hurt you,
a vicious circle, sparring at the gathering

M-M-M-Mike, Aaron, and Eddie, I'm g-g-good and ready,
wanna k-k-k-keep the p-p-party rockin' steady,
'ay g-girl you lookin' pretty, wanna get you nice and sweaty,
girl w-w-w-watch this st-st-style like F-F-Freddy,
I'm gonna break you up and back down, never gonna put the mic back down,
it's A-c-e-y-a-l-o-n-e, now it's finna crack now,
gimme one of y'all or two of y'all, it don't really matter who you are,
when the sound come through like move your car, sounds so good like pull it up,
like mash it up, smash it up, poetry takeover, that's what's up,
M-M-Mike, Aaron, and Ed-Ed-d-Eddie, that's what's up,
this music is our mastery, don't tell me what it has to be,
as for me, it'll be a catastrophe,
if you just don't stop harrassing me, the audacity,
people asking me about this blasphemy, tellin' me the whole world's passing me,
but I gotta do what's in all the best interest,
even if they're not interested, still gotta get your engine tested,
manifest the destiny the best of me for development still arrested,
enemy to the public, locked us up and lovin' it,
society's menace, the look so grim is to give him the sense and double it,
now what's the deal, who's the dealer,
this is bo cuz I feel like the house is cheatin', who's the pimp,
who's the mack, who's the player, some of you hoes ain't eatin',
and some of you hoes won't eat, you'll die of hunger,
I'm MC Ed-Ed-d-Eddie Hayes, I'm from the under
