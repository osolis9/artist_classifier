Over:Sean Kingston
See it started 'round December when we first talked
But then I knew you was fake from the start
Sayin' that you love me, playin' with my heart
Actin' like you cared, just to be around a star
(But oh no)

Me shoulda knew when you take me to the mall
Smilin' at my face but you're buying up a storm
Now I regret it, should I listen to my mom?
To my mom, whoa

Everything good must come to a stop
You played with my head
Now you're 'bout to get dropped
Gimme my ring, gimme my watch and go

So girl, it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again

So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl it's over

Talkin' on the phone like everyday
Sendin' me messages, "Hey baby"
Tellin' me you want me to meet your family
When you really, you just tryin' to go to the Grammys
(Well, oh no)

I shoulda knew you wasn't for me
You didn't like me, you liked by Bentley
All them stories were shady
But baby, don't worry 'cause

Everything good must come to a stop
You played with my head
Now you're 'bout to get dropped
Gimme my ring, gimme my watch and go

So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over, and I don't wanna see your face again, again

So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over, and I don't wanna see your face again, again

Ever since she walked through that door
She left my heart on the floor
And I can't take this no more
I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna see her again

Ever since she walked through that door
She left my heart on the floor
And I can't take this no more
I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna see her again

So girl, just pack your bags and leave my crib
Girl, stop talkin', I'm tired of this
All this fussing, all this fighting tonight

So girl, it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl, it's over, hey, so girl, it's over
