I can Feel it.
My life is crumbling down.
Down and i can't hold my ground.
Yes I can Feel it and there's nothing I can do.
But remain captive to the boys in blue.
No it's nothing like I picture it.
My plans backfired now I'm worth shit.
And now I can't even run my life.
I'm locked up inside with the rules to abide by.
I can Feel it crumbling down.
And down I look around cuz I can't even hold my ground.
I try to climb it but it's no use.
A swinging noose awaits me.
I just wanna live life.
I'm pleading to you.
I just wanna live life.
And live the rest of my youth .
Live the rest of my youth.
