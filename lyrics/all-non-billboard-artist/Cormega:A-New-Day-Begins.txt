A-New-Day-Begins:Cormega
Under the sun vultures looming
Hoping to consume a culture wounded
Boldly refusing to die show and proving
I embodied what only few can
Wearing sincerity not the robe of Judas
My golden rule is live no lie
I know truth is part of my focus
Music art imitates life growth included
I'm bound by word hold me to it
My heart and nerve are accountable no excuses
I never made a deal with my soul included
I know what's real and I know illusions
Misery loves company I chose seclusion
There's degrees to separation
I know my true friends and forced alliances
Conspiring the denial of hearing my aspiring rhyming is timeless and genuine
That's where my mind is at: a reflective state
I weigh my mans like grams
Understanding there are losses when you measure weight
