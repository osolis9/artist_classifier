We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway
We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway
Skididididilly woah

All to think a nigga came from mopping floors though
From the nose bleed section to the first row
Uninvited, still we came through the front door
And now we 'bout to let the whole world know
I never let my people down
Them non believers, they believe us now
I'm just a common nigga with a dream
Who's standing tall enough for y'all to see
Let's go

We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway
We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway
Skididididilly woah

Ever since a youngin' I've been going for the gusto
Told me I'll be there by 21 and I'll say fuck no
Still here in this bitch, trying to bust a nut though
Came from way behind, now we the niggas in the front row
Played us straight up, embarrassing how they played us
Ironic how the shit we wrote for others in their playlist
The niggas I grew up is the niggas that I came with
Benny-D and , they used to tell us that we ain't shit
Save it, save it, pussy nigga save it
Now tell the world them island boys is now your new favorite
Now they got me on my Virgin Islands everyday shit
You hearing 'bout us now but where I'm from I been famous
Women in the States, they used to tell me that I talk funny
Now when I speak to 'em all they say is, "Please talk for me"
Now they want a rock, man, kill it 'til they can't stand
Eat it, Pac-Man, beat it, grand slam
Turn up on their ass like I was missing
Would swear my feet was in the toilet how I'm on my shit
And yeah I told my momma I'll make it back when I was still a kid
And even back then I was grown cause you could see I wasn't kiddin'
Let's go

We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway
We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway

I was seven, my first bed came from out the garbage can
Ain't my fault my fucking daddy was a garbage man
Yeah Yakiebo he my hero, that's my momma's man
He the reason I won't bow down to no other man
I was hungry, all I had to eat was bread and cheese
Bread and cheese, bread and cheese for like seven weeks
On Rock City, nothing pretty, more than just the toilet shitty
It's a pity, it's a pity, wish that you could see
I grow up around bunch of bad man
St. Thomas aka Lil Taliban
And now the whole world understand
I'm just a product of the place that I come from

We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway
We're broad, we're broad, we're broader than Broadway
