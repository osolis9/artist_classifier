In-the-Zone:PMD
[PMD:]
Pass the callers, w'sap with the small talk
You know 's the PMD flips it crazy smoth
Like the moon walk
So kill the boom and chill
Nigga save the thief act
In effect like Das best belive that
P will bring it, swing it, keeps my shit hardcore
Plus next for Mic Doc, another world tour
From ghetto to ghetto
Borough to borough
Niggaz pump my sounds loud cause my shit's thero
Hello, where is the P channel zero
In the zone trapped off, kid can't hear you

[Chorus: x4]
Back up, boy... hand motion
In the zone trapped off, kid can't hear you

[PMD:]
Let get back to the underground someone is claimin my sound
Catch the beat down
Or that other kid, yeah yeah, he caught the Greyhound
Outta here, gone, still pumpin rap songs
To the mic wreck, 1, 2 to the break of dawn
To my people uptown, downtown, eastcoast, westcoast
Nuff props to Boogie Down
Spark the L, charge the brain cell, hell
No time to dwell back live like the third rail
I got it in me I know I do not like the? rules
He sweats, tryna climb he hits the turbo boost
Sways can't fade P lacks the 12 gauge
Peace, I'm Audi 5thou' still on a rampage

[Chorus: x4]
Back up, boy... hand motion
In the zone trapped off, kid can't hear you

[PMD:]
Moms not feelin well, and I'm feelin it
So step the fuck back
She sayed produce that funk and kick that I'll rap
You know what you made off
Didn't raise no slouch nigga
Look out for yours, focus on a real picture
So strong, gave me the strenght to pump this rap songs
And now I'm bringin it back
In his brothers arm, the dangerous
Ain't no taimin this, far from famous kid
I'm just and underground rapper servin a hard bid
In the industry
You gotta be kidding me
They wanna be, they wanna be like P, MD
But they can't be
Be studyin this for 8 years now I gotta sceene
Some MC's come, and seen some MC's go
Why they choose the crosover, cause they blind and don't know
Big up to all new jacks
Follow you first notion
Chump niggaz:

[Chorus: x4]
Back up, boy... hand motion
In the zone trapped off, kid can't hear you

Back up, boy... hand motion
Back up, boy... hand motion
Back up, boy... hand motion
Back up, boy... hand motion
Back up, boy... hand motion
