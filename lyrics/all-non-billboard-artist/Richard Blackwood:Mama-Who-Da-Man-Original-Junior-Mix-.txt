Mama - Who Da Man?
Say my name baby
We love you RB
Check you everyday on MTV
Who da man, Who da man baby

When I was young
I was a class clown with glasses
Y’know the type That you could burn mad ass with
Got no romance
I was a joke to look at
So I had to be the funny man
Like who da man
But on my 1st day I watched my car break down
had to be the missing pounds for petrol
I was petrol, we both had to push the car up the hill
To Kentucky fried chill
All the people on the bus died laughing
Ain’t that Richard Blackwood, boy you weren’t mackin’
One day I’ma make you eat your words
In the back of my mind I heard

Mama used to say take your time young man
Mama used to say don’t you rush to get old
Mama used to say take it in your stride
and live your life

On the comedy circuit they were telling me to do what the Americans do
According to who...
Is that a real Soul II Soul stay true
And my uncle used to say stay you the brave crew

Now I’m getting pounds and hugs from the people I check for
From Birmingham to Brixton and more.
Did ‘enough shows, with no dough, no podiums and only 2 people in the coliseum
Can’t go from 1st to 5th gear
Looking in my rear cause I’m bound to hear
One day when I had you back where’s my drink at
There you go tap water - Thames finest
Its only natural from a minus, who went to a plus
UK Black bound to bus- only cause I knew who to trust

Say my name baby, We love you RB
Check you everyday on MTV, who da man baby
You da man big boo, no matter what you do we got love for you
Say my name girlfriend - Ohh We love you RB
Check you everyday on MTV

Look son if you wanna front on me
I’ma single you out everyday on MTV
And if you want more Channel 4 know the score
Rollin with the Richard Blackwood show - Where to go!
Sky’s the limit, and my light you can’t dim it
On the silver screen I’ma get up in it in a minute
It ain’t about a beamer or the Benz
I wanna raise the flag like Loose ends - What!!!!

What y’saying - heh
Say my name, say my name
