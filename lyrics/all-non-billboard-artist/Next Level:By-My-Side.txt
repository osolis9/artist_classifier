Say something
Uh

Verse 1 - Compound

I'm looking back at when we first begun
Known from day one we would have a long run uh
Glazing in your eyes I know you're my loved one
Try and tell me otherwise cause no one can
We got this, don't even need a game plan
When I fall asleep its your face that I see
And when I wake up yeah its your face that I see
Knowing you're mine keeps me smiling all day
Loosing you is a price I simply can't pay
Growing closer to my heart as the days pass
To be with you forever, I'd walk across glass
Uh never felt like this I know we're gonna last
I could be down and out ready to take my last breath
Then you'd kiss me, you'd bring me back from death
And that would be the reason why my last breath,
My last breath would be to tell you how much i fucking love you

I can't believe that we are one
It's like all my dreams have come true
And baby I'm so glad I found you
All I need is for you to be here right by myside
Ooh baby
Oooh

Verse 2 - Mackin

I admit I'm not confident I'm a really shy
But I knew it was right when I looked into your eye
I thought I could of been love at first sight
If I could I would never let you, I'd hold you tight
Protect you if you ever got into a fight
Try and talk and all you ever do is fucking bite
I'm never gonna get anywhere don't know why I try
Was a waste of time, I ain't gonna lie
My hearts broken, all I'm gonna do is sit and cry
I try and smile but it feels like I must slowly die
I never thought I'd be lead on for over 50 miles
I cheer up eventually but it may take a while
That's what it feels like down deep inside
Try enter my heart, access denied
I'm gonna carry on what I do best
I love all my fans and my team
God bless!

Verse 3 - Compound

Uh
You came into my life with a smile like an angel
And you smashed down my wall with no damn regrets
Scared to loose you but I know through the upsets
That you will be the one to stand right by my side
All the times I told you I loved I never lied
Knowing you'll always be there so I can confide
Able to read you like a book its like forever
Looking to the future I know it's gonna be forever
Cause its just you i for etternity
I love you and they tell me to watch carefully
But I know I don't have too cause i got you
If I didn't have you then put me in a coma
At least then I wouldn't feel the pain as much
And hopefully I'd wake up with you right by my side
I couldn't live a day without you being mine
I fucking love you
You don't understand
