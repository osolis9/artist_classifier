Yeah, niggas want to talk shit in the muthafucking room

Rampage I'm coming express through your chest
In the Lex-GS, stop talking BS
My watch is still flooded, 850 for the budget

I'm Rugged, cats get gutted, rhyme then stab
Send their rusty ass friend to the lab
You's a crab, I take mines off the top like Fab

Hit you with a jab for the 98
Number one in billboard with the triangle shape
Flipmode on every mix tape, watch you cats get scrape
Rampage Alexander the great

Better run for cover for it's too late

Meaning I run that, waiting on mine like I'm the LL comeback
Wack rappers crawled out from holes
Now you souped 'cuz you slithered up the todem pole

Now Baby Sham take the safety off hold

There's alot of fake cats that jump in their mans Rolls
Come to my show with these fake wallos
Turqoise hid invoiced with plans to blow

See me backstage with the gauge upholds my pantsleg
Hand made suits contracts is in the briefcase
Life negotiate so when I split these pies

I'm sexing your dime, flow for flow batteling rhymes
Talking some crime

Better run for cover for it's too late

Crack axles peel out in black fords
Splatter brains on dashports, start anthrax wars

See's cast like task force die on a cross
(Ha)
July 4th blow your hands off
(Blaaoow)
Special delivery
Jam 'cause with ghetto misery
When I'm killabrese of canine
Last name heard it through the grapevine

Killing your blood millineum bug
United States divide with hate crimes
Roll snake eyes, in the concrete jungle of hell
While Lord have stays, super like the son of Jorel

Better run for cover for it's too late
What?
You know we got it locked way out of state

I be the last nigga, the quick to bust your ass niggas
Do anything in this world to get the cash niggas
I might even get mad and even slash niggas
Rob them and get away in a car and crash niggas

What's the world gonna do when I drop the smash nigga?
Iron all in your face don't make me pull the trigga
Another reason for me to have to poor my own swigga

Thought I was posing for word up but a Fed took my picture
Surgeon general I represent the underneath
The ask for shit beef, the worlds greatest fucking thief
Brick layer hardcore smash your front teeth

Wilding it straight, giving their mother mad grief
Rob a nigga strip him down leave him in his briefs
Do so much dirt, the priest asked me to turn another leaf
Made the priest flip change his whole belief
Started wilding in the club with them niggas starting beef, act fool
