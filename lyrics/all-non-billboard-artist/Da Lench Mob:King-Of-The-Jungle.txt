King-Of-The-Jungle:Da Lench Mob
It was an African day like most African days
Hot, humid and miserable

The jungle man is the king of the jungle
'Bout as strong as he can be

'Cause I'm a G with the LM, you better run and tell 'em
The trick ass bitches are gettin' dumped in the ditches
All day so you know it's all good
I'm off from token more like Masta Goden

I'm iceberg slim, 'cause I'm cool like that
I'm gee like that, a girl-handed gat
It ain't no thang for me to watch people hang
'Cause he don't wanna rumble in my motherfuckin' jungle

Short dog is the king of the jungle
'Bout as strong as he can be

'Cause I'ma G, sippin' on the tropical thriller
You hear the roar, down boy, it's my big gorilla killer
As the bad guy, lookin' for an alibi, don't swing by on the peril vines
Go to the finish, big Texas is next, stuck him in the neck
And I'm beatin' on my chest

T-Bone is the king of the jungle
'Bout as strong as he can be

'Cause I'ma G, get back as I gat at the fear
I pack my gear with the hard rock tip I digs it in the dip
Out of the dip comes a thrill with the pointed tip
The devil don't do shit, I keeps my hand on my bamboo spear

Oh dear, I smell fear coming from the rear of the jungle
No wonder, he's done hoe, niggaz find the bozo
Oh no, the king of the jungle

I'm the k-k-king, I'm the k-k-king
I'm the k-k-king, I'm the k-k-king
Uh, get upa, get down, get on upa, get down
Get on upa, get down, get on upa, get down

The jungle man is the king of the jungle
'Bout as strong as he can be

Motherfuckin' is talk, the Lench Mob fell off
There's no proof in his breath with the tech to get wrecked
Gorilla pimp slappin' on this hoe ass tricks
JD pick me up, oh this doll has nice tits

The Mob is deep, with the stars intention
Bestebas still killin' and lynchin'
Fool, this is Lench Mob so feel the wrath
Young motherfuckers don't even know the half

Short dog is the king of the jungle
'Bout as strong as he can be

And that's me, deep in the jungle where the Dog is the one
Let me count a gun on the singular drum
Dum, ditty, dum, ditty, ditty, dum, dum
Here we come, here we come, here we kitty come, come

Bring the thunder the black magic wonder
Lench mob'll get 'cha just don't whip me with no whip
Razzamatazz I do a drive like Shabazz
I blast from the past, hittin' that ass

T-Bone is the king of the jungle
'Bout as strong as he can be

Who me? Yes, back to the jungle vines swingin'
Ding a linging broke a neck, back and lookin' for some red neck crackas
Rigged and givin' the fuckin' shit when I check 1, 2
Devil what you wanna do?

When you see the voodoo, you ask who's who
The Lench mob crew, we comin' brand new
So check it, can I wreck it for a second?
1, 2, 3 yeah, I'm still a fuckin' G

I'm the k-k-king, I'm the k-k-king
I'm the k-k-king, I'm the k-k-king
Uh, get upa, get down, get on upa, get down
Get on upa, get down, get on upa get down

King of the jungle
