Running:Khrysis
Runnin' away, runnin' away, runnin' away
Runnin' away, runnin' away, runnin' away

[Verse 1]
Yo, around that time when Common asked could he borrow a dollar?
That was the question that my uncle was askin' my momma
He said he'd bring it back tomorrow, don't worry he promise
And tell her that he kicked that habit, I wish he was honest
See I was living with inner city that didn't show pity to anybody
But really, you silly thinking you make it out it
Maybe if I was lucky could make it to city college
Scheming to leave these black streets like Dave Hollister
See I'm pushing more keys than Captain & Tennille
I was watching Cosby wishing I was Theo
You see, he had Cockroach, I had cockroaches
And when my friends over I hope they not notice
Just food for thought just some place to put your plate on
They shooting up the playgrounds and the places where we playin'
Group of niggas come around asking what block do we stay on
Runnin' for our dear life, beggin' momma can we stay home?

[Hook]
Nowhere to go
Just me and my friends
Runnin' away, runnin' away, runnin' away
Nowhere to go
Hope to see tomorrow
Runnin' away, runnin' away, runnin' away

[Verse 2]
I was ditching high school when Kanye dropped The Dropout (dropout, dropout)
Pop, pop in then we pop out (pop out)
We just wanna wild out when it's hot out
Got a homie who on lockdown, cops caught him with the Glock out
Young, black and ignorant
Public places belligerent, pouring liquor and sipping it
Chilling with women and get a little bit [ambidiverant?]
Reading these girls' minds but all my niggas illiterate
Backseat lovers, hoping I got rubbers
Hoping I don't slip and make a daughter and mother
Something I can't wish, she ain't my main chick
Only thing I can't hit is a 7/10 split so
Stay in your lane, the frame of mind when you from the gutter
Life a game, or Bingo the way it's callin' numbers
This all that matter, watch out where your head at
Headlights out -- rat tat tat tat tat tat!

[Hook]
