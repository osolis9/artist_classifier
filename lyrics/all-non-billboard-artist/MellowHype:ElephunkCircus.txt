ElephunkCircus:MellowHype
[Intro: Left Brain]
Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls
Thank you for coming out tonight to the Mellow fuckin' Hype circus
Left Brain, Hodgy Beats, lions, tigers, bears and wolves
Hold on to your seats people

[Hodgy Beats:]
Mellow is the ocean, Hype like my nerves is
It's MellowHype in my ElephunkCircus
Music waiter I serve you like a clerk did
9 to 5 and I don't even like to work shifts
Hindu fires light the life of the party
On your mark get set go, get them engines started
Lions, tigers, monkeys locked away from the audience
Clowns running through the crowd fightin' in their argument
They keep splashin' the water, even splashin' your daughter
The whiplash caught her, the balloon cash cough-up
When you watch the room and balance on a tight rope
Your adrenaline pumps and gives you a tight throat
Cantaloupe antelope antidote, white goats
Clowns paintin' kids faces tellin' them polite jokes
As time blows over and the show's over
I'm ridin' home with giraffes in my Ra-Rover

[Outro: Left Brain]
Oh shit, OF, Odd Future
It's Mellowhype, yeah, pass the peanuts
