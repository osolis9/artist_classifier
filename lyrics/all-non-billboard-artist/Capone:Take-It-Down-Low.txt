[Chris Brown - Verse 3]
She's on the pole
Watch her breaking down
Her booty swirl
Her ass shake the ground, pop that booty now
Pop that, pop that booty now
Pop that booty now
Pop that, pop that booty now!
Breezy in this bitch, I make them yell, I make 'em holler
What you're talking about?
Hell yeah, I got them dollars
And money on their mind
Money money on their mind
And my presidents is going in the air when she winds on my
Potty mouth, she's from the south, she's dancing on my. Whoa.
After that I give her more bread then she dances on pole-oh.
Up and down just like po-go
Give her a money then she'll go
On the floor, on the floor,
Take it down, take it down, down low

For all the stupids on my hitlist
Watch how many rags I blow
They say this look is best for my kidneys
I know, I know, I know
And I've got 'em all taking off their clothes
And I've got 'em all working on that pose
I'm the bomb like napalm, Akon what you're waiting on?

[Chorus]
Take it down, take it down
Take it down low!
Take it down, take it down
Take it down low!
Take it down, take it down
Take it down low!
Take it down, take it down
Take it down low!

Take it low girl
