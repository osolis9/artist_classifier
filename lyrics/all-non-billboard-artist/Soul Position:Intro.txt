You know what it is
You know who this is
But I'ma say my name anyway
They call me Blueprint
You know my steez

You know, holdin' it down

This is Soul Position
Probably knew that already though
Yo, now last year, a lot of people been comin' up to me like

Took my time with it though
Ain't about to put no garbage out, feel me?
