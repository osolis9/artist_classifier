Straight-From-the-Heart:PMD
[Mitts]
It doesn't matter how you say it
It doesn't matter if you look the part
This is the Universal language
That's spoken from the heart
[UZI]
(To talk to the upright man)
(To mix the bonds together)
(Free of worthless thoughts of the blades sound)
(The flow of the method of the sword from the method of the sound)
(The fiery in a settled state of mind, like a polished mirror and a still water)
(The sound in a settled state of mind, like a polished mirror and a still water)
[Freddy]
No me importa como lo dices
Tu mirada no importa aqui
Es el idioma universal que nos ajunta
De corazon
Straight from the heart
Straight from the heart
