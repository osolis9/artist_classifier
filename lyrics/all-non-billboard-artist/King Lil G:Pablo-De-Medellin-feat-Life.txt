Pablo-De-Medellin-feat-Life:King Lil G
Pulled up like Pablo
I be feelin' like I'm Pablo
Pulled up like Pablo
Drug money like Pablo

Pulled up like I'm Pablo
(Pulled up like I'm Pablo)
Drug money like Pablo (Yo)
Drug money like Pablo (Sss' right)

I be feelin' like I'm Pablo!

Bullet holes to my enemies (Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!)
Hustlin' hard, man it feels like the Medellin

And I fucks with that Hennessy
Long live that AK forty-seventy 'ternally

And I'm talkin' that Espa√±ol
If I say "Enemy go" then we go to war

And my soldiers got out of jail
Made some connects and I got my girls some Chanel

Got my face full of tattoos
Uno Ocho Siete, that's been my attitude

And they got me on Child Support
Stopped fuckin' with baby mama long time ago

And you seen it on CNN
Them drug dealers been goin' hard and they Mexican
And I been sellin' drugs again
They tryna indict us but they got no evidence

Pulled up like Pablo
I be feelin' like I'm Pablo
Pulled up like Pablo
Drug money like Pablo

Pulled up like I'm Pablo
(Pulled up like I'm Pablo)
Drug money like Pablo (Yo)
Drug money like Pablo (Sss' right)

I be feelin' like I'm Pablo!

I'm a fuckin' riduh
When I come through baby I don't leave no survivors
Breakin' yo shit, damn I love that screw driver

Pray that I quit and Lord knows I love my mama
On my ---

Killers movin' silence
Livin' in the violence
All I know is robbin'
Started actin' silence

Been up in my pocket
Gotta get the profit
Imma live in profits
Seen it all, I watchin'

Pass through the the hood
There go, they want your wallet
How it is in Compton?
That's a different topic

Losin' ain't no option
I feel like, I feel like losin' ain't no option
Imma get it poppin'

Never quit or stoppin', self made
See me when I'm plottin' till these --- ridin'
All these bitches watchin'
On me
Hope they ain't forgotten
Hope they ain't forgotten
