Guitar:Lady Sovereign
If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, sing it
If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it,  just sing it

I wrote S O R R Y
I'm tellin' you that and I don't know why
Maybe because I was sky high
And thinking too much about my life

So I turned off the light and I tried to write
But only bullshit left my mind
And most of the time I was fine but you're windin' me up
While I'm hard on my grind

When were you born? 1985
Why didn't you finish school? Because I skied
Step back, get back, come out of my face, yeah
I'm just tryin' to live my life

If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, sing it
If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, just sing it

I feel a little tired, I feel like cryin'
I feel like lyin', I feel like I'm tryin' to do
What I'm supposed to do today?
Fuck it

A couple of interviews, a photo shoot
A show to do, promote new tunes
Oh, I hate it when I feel this way
Oh, why do I feel this way? Tell me

Yesterday was a different story
High and mighty, feeling glory
Shut down Time Square, know that you saw me
Felt enormous like twenty stories

If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, sing it
If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, just sing it

Today of all days they try to rush me
Hush puppy, let me do my thing
I'm not your puppet on a string bruh
Really?

Now don't get me wrong you silly little punk
Expect me to walk 'cause I'm not gonna run
I wish life was as easy as playing the guitar
Ya just pick it up and ya strum, eh maybe not

If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, sing it
If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, sing it

If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, sing it
If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, just sing it
