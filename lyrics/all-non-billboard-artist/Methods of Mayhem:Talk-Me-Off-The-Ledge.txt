you got your panties in a bunch again
i turn, here comes that sucker punch again
you said that we were through i needed to be over you
it started with an innocent cup o' joe....

now you wanna know now you wanna know
now you wanna know.....

i gotta talk you off the ledge
i gotta talk you off the ledge

you play your games, i won't participate
i'm not a bracelet you can confiscate
you said that we were through i needed to get over you
i didn't know you'd go and change your mind again

now you wanna know now you wanna know
now you wanna know...

i gotta talk you off the ledge
i gotta talk you off the ledge
