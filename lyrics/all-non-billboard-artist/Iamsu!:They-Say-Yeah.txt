They-Say-Yeah:Iamsu!
I walk with a doper bumper up in my swagger
Can't fuck with you rappers all you rapper's actors
I'm the total package I'm a cold assassin
Smoke a bowl of grass until the end I'm grasping
I just took a shot I think I went too far
I just popped a bottle I'm still at the bar
I don't pop no molly, left that in '13
Fucking up with checks over kick and jeans
I can't trust these bitches
I can't trust these hoes
Focused on my digits, gotta get my dough
I can't sign that contract
I can't sell my soul
I've been on that road ten thousand dollar shows
They say we were popping deep up in that new shit
Like Mandela, like 2-Pac gon' ask me where the juice is
OGs in my city, I respect the movement
All these rappers they ain't near me, imitating Suzy

[Hook:]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ask her if she want to turn up with young
Suzy, she say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I say can I bring my whole team in the building, they say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Every time I hit the stage I make a movie, they say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
We all black, we all black
And they say

Work stay on my guest list there's no unemployment
All these hoes for free, they here for your enjoyment
I do this for time ain't no need for practice
Once upon a time that hunnids in my mattress
All I do is turn up turn up on my haters
Can't do shit for free I do not fuck with favors
You ain't have position you can't sit at the table
They say that I'm crazy, they say I'm unstable
Bow to this position that came out from Grinding
Cuban bracelet, Cuban linx, change them [?] for diamonds
All this [?] just to get this paper
Focused on progression, tryna switch my neighbors
