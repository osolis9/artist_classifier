Suddenly:MNEK
Taking chances in the dark
To find out if romance is hard
I've never seen you in this light
Feelings begin to surface and take flight, oh

And suddenly you kissed me, yeah, suddenly
I now believe in eternity
When you look at me, I can't breathe
Don't wanna let go cause it's hurting me
Can we afford to be a chord
Or are we just drifting melodies?

We're grasping onto all we know
I'm screaming at you through my soul
I doubt tomorrow that you'll feel the same
So tell me if you want, please don't play games, don't play games

Because baby, when you kissed me, oh, suddenly
I started to believe in eternity
When you looked at me, I couldn't breathe
Didn't wanna let go, it was hurting me
Can we afford to be a chord
Or are we just drifting melodies?

Oh, you kissed me so suddenly, kissed me so suddenly
I now believe in eternity
When you look at me, I can't breathe
I don't wanna let go cause it hurts too much
Can we afford to be a chord
Or are we drifting melodies?
Or are we drifting melodies? Yeah
Oh, and we drift so suddenly
