Letter-To-Fans:Jeremih
(Verse)
Late nights,emotions
Bright night,one shot of dose
The only thing that can get me by
Stay by my sofa in this condo
But I'm good dawg got some good tree
2k and ol' papa dogs
Find time to look at the walls
These probablly stalk yeah I'm proud of us
Sipping on these corona 
Maybe this is the moment
You smell girl, that's restaurant they told me
People tell me they don't need it dawg
It's just everything how I want it
Nigga say it never been about
I need to talk on what or how you gonna
Grind harder,grind harder
To my bank account Oh my God
No longer do it for myself
I do it now for my son
Some are here for the wrong reasons
Anything that for the goal
But I ain't forget you grand diablo
Subdue some heat light from the soul
This one here right for the gold
Had her do,rep her hole
Just got some fans ,some amazing fans
I see you soon at the arena shows
Gon' right after optimus 
Who's your favourite ask some hoes
As the cross cuts in the seas 
I hope you all won't never think

(Hook x2)
Baby you're not gonna be like I told you
Never we're going nowhere,baby
(It's like I'm nervous)
I'll be here for you,for you,for you
(It's like I'm nervous)

(Cerse)
I swear I let the haters hate
I know they mad they'll never get to me
You're the ones that were there from the start
That's why you always get the best of me
Let's forget all of the war shows
And why they ain't never mention me
Look at it like this, I looked at my wrist
Like man it's time to make history
And I'm sipping on this corona
Maybe this is the moment
I feel like I'm florida 
When she mail ,warrup now
We're just here to have a good time
Set labels on the corners
Steady robbing out to have a good time
The fairy tale ain't over so
I won, no ahead the hater when they hate you
Level with the killer on the floor
If we say to get the elemental plea
No telling where we'd probably go
Your green eyes,green lights
I'm trying to see the lies
I don't dance after the heat lights
I grind harder,grind harder
'Til my bank account Oh my God
Ever mess with my fans food or my fitty dog
Let's call karma
I promise me and my mama that 
I outta feel you all up not I'm not

(Hook x2)
Baby you're not gonna be like I told you
Never we're going nowhere,baby
(It's like I'm nervous)
I'll be here for you,for you,for you
(It's like I'm nervous)

I'll be here for you,for you,for you
(It's like I'm nervous)
I'll be here for you,for you,for you
(It's like I'm nervous)
I'll be here for you,for you,for you
(It's like I'm nervous)
I'll be here for you,for you,for you
(It's like I'm nervous)

(Outro)
Well this goes to show,that nobody really know
That all even be able to say
Welcome world to Canyon Gray
Man means mine,and mine means lead over self
One man,one chance ,one chance
One life,that's why I'm still here
To all the years,the tears and the fears
Came the breath of life
Just a mother to her daughter and a father keep after his son
I'll be here until all the deed is gone
Like still waters run deep
I'll tell you I'll never fall asleep
And the gift that I've been giving 
I must give back to the streets
That's why I'm still here ,I'm still here
