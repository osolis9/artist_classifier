Something-Got-You:The Nextmen
Was a time
when we began to write
a world within our heads
taking time
to leave it all behind
and live on what we said
wasnt blind
its just i can see it now
but it was just that who
i knew wasn't the you
that makes me blue
but its true
that its not you
yeaaah
something's got you
and it't not me
it's taking over you
and you cant see
something's got you
so i cant find
what i know of
what i know of
what i know of
Youuuuuuu

was a time
you saw your second chance
the future in my hands
for a while
it was you and all you ask
it became our only plans
wasnt blind
its just i can see it now
but it was just that who
i knew wasn't the you
that makes me blue
but its true
that its not you
yeaaah
something's got you
and it't not me
it's taking over you
and you cant see
something's got you
so i cant find
what i know of
what i know of
what i know of
Youuuuuuu

your taking flight when
you should be still again
your in my sight then
your moving off again
i try not to lose what's
not yours to take away
but then ou're back again

ooooh
omething's got you
and it't not me
it's taking over you
and you cant see
something's got you
so i cant find
what i know of
what i know of
what i know of
Youuuuuuu

something's got you
and it't not me
it's taking over you
and you cant see
something's got you
so i cant find
(what i know of)
(what i know of)
