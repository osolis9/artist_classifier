Hush:Da Muzicianz
[girl speaking in French]

[Verse 1:]
I know it been a long time
Since we both felt the heat
But tonight will be burnin' and tossin' the sheets
No we won't speak not even a peep
First you toot then I beep
Then I pull up to yo cheeks
You are so sweet
Sexy, unique
Nice and petite
Yeah that's just right for me
Your company is all that I need
Forget about the world girl
Its just you and me
Pure ecstasy is where we will be
Once I achieve my goal and I climax the g
Here are the keys
They go to my heart
I just hope you don't tease me and tear it apart

[Chorus:]
Hush be quiet
You don't have to say a word
Kissin' and huggin lady
You don't have to say a word
I want to get sexual with you
You don't have to say a word
Your body is talkin' to me
You don't have to say a word

[Verse 2:]
She please me
Never tease me
Body is bangin' believe me
? all night like I should until nigga get sleepy
Going going non stop 3%7^& ooh drop
Like it from the back
But she really love it when I'm on the top
Sometimes I go? make a?
All between the sheets
It's really nothing but ah skeet skeet
She coverin' ha face wit' the pillow
Screamin' like she see thriller
Can't get enough
She want it rough
Everytime that I hit ha
And she stay movin'? by choice
I keep on my bedroom voice
And good lovin' is where she got
So now she sprung of course
I love ya curves and how they swerve
They be actin' superb

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I got somethin' I want to say to ya
I wanna play witcha
Can I come over and spend the night and day witcha
And do some freaky things
That you did in ya dreams
No talking we don't have to say anything
We start off at the door
Takin' off each other clothes
Next thing you know
We on the floor
All in the livin' room
All in the kitchen too
Stop we have to make the bedroom boom

(Boom goes the bedroom behind closed doors
Yo legs like a? just work that back move and
move fast while i'm up in that ass
Be quiet you don't want them to hear us outside)

[Chorus]
