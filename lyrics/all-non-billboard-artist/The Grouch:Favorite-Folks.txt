Produced By The Grouch


Freak freak y'all, to the beat y'all X3
Freak freak y'all, to the beat

I fell off, I came weak, but im on again, so love me
I was lost, you can see, that im on again, trust me
If you hear me think about your favorite folks is lost X3
If you hear me think about your favorite folks
Well folks like folks that like them back, right
How you gonna act off a gallon of act right? wrong
The song said simple so pack light
You gonna hurt your back if you lucky and you act tight
Strong wills a must, spills guts
A real upchuck till she feels fucked up
Long nights and short days my fortes swayed
Recorded a lifetime ya boy stay paid
But uh, he's lost and the sauce ain't grade
Poison no poise and his love got played
Above and beyond control, afraid
Playin' a role he stole what she gave
That wasn't very brave, he spilled she forgave
The evil he built to which he was a slave
A bitch she never became, the prick forever ashamed
But on his name he changed

I fell off, I came weak, but im on again, so love me
I was lost, you can see, that im on again, trust me
If you hear me think about your favorite folks is lost X3
If you hear me think about your favorite folks

Well folks, the spokes I bought didn't matter
Most the dope I smoked made me sadder
I shoulda made a baby instead of ladies crazy
Walkin' my shoes many a dude would trade me
And now I scrub em again
Toothbrush and everything I love em again, leave him alone
He's doin' chaturangas(yoga position) in the zone
Humungous love for life off of that he'd be blown
Had he a known, he never woulda cheated in the first place
Beat it with a breath, cheat death, now I work taste success
Repeat it eat it all keep cravin
The price it ain't small cause im still payin
Real layin still just to feel the effects of the high
I do it cause its good, not just to get by
Why would I stay dirty?
I made my mistakes it was fate not worthy
Im earthly, dumb, godly, brilliant, deeply sorry, hella resilient
