My name is Joker
I bet you know that shit now
I did it for fun
Now this how everybody wanna spit now
Stay strapped up
Everybody better get down
Smoked up all the kush and now you have nowhere to sit down
Please check the wrist now
Bet ya wanna get that
Keep a chopper on me
I'm a walking helipad
See her nigga wanna be me
She just wanna freak me
She wetter than a birdbath so I guess that makes me Tweety
Arab money sir
I don't have a Visa
My ear is icy like I put my corn in the freezer
Hit MySpace now Tha Joker's all they know
All eyes on me like a stove but I'm cold
I'm thin but I'm bold
I'm hot but I'm froze
She grinned and got chose
Now she going home solo
Listen up Joker got a little riddle
Two Brazilian twins with too cold in the middle

It's guns drugs and money
That's the shit I'm into
Throwing shots at niggas
Man I am the bartender
I'm bad I'm bad
You can look at me and tell
Money is the root of evil so my bank account is hell
Jeweler ask if I want diamonds and I told him well certainly
He said ok and now the chain looks like it went through surgery
I love pussy but before I hit it make your jaw drop
Lifetime supply of magnums
Dresser drawers I dodge car lots
You know I'm a freak girl
You want it just ask me
Shit Karrine Steffans told me I was too nasty
And she was talking physical
I'm also nasty lyrical
But please excuse me while my Marlboro niggas get spiritual

Joker too cold
Man I spit like a spout do
My flow super cold
Bitch I hope you brought your house shoes
I'm the best nigga
Blow up man I'm bout to
And I have a lot of potential like her mouth do
Damn you stupid dancer
Please free my lingo
So sick with this shit that I am bald from the chemo
Swag on a million a zillion or higher
You have on an outfit
Pussy this is an attire
This lean gonna kill my liver
This smoke gonna keep me coughing
So when I'm in this bitch I'm like a dead man walking
The club is my coffin
The Bentley is my hearse
Nation is the pallbearer and C-Mo is even worse
I spit crack on every verse
You would think I'm snorting salt
Plus hard ass hooks like I'm tryna catch a shark
Man which rapper gonna bark
Bet nobody in the game
And who is the best
Don't act like you don't know the name
Cause
