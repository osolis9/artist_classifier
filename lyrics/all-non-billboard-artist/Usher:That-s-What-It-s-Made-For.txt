That-s-What-It-s-Made-For:Usher
Oh, yeah baby, yeah
Yeah babe
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Listen up, I got a story to tell
Check it out now
And I know you can identify with this one
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
Check it out

Figured I'd hit it and quit it just one night
Got so good to me doubled back twice
I must've been outta my mind
Knowin' I don't wanna, I'm about to nut-up
  (What's wrong?)

Guess it's too late to turn back now
Can't apologize 'coz that ain't my style
Shorty rainin' wet up in my ear talkin' 'bout
I got what you came for
(This here got your name on it)

Go on and hit it, that's what it's made for
We got protection, that's what it's made for
Boo are you trippin' now, you know I got it
That's what it's made for

So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
Know you gon' felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it but we gon' still get down like this

Game rules, no cap no cut
But even Superman couldn't turn your love down
I slipped up, slipped in
Hey man what the hell you doin'?
Raw dog is a never, I know, I know better

Heard her whisper, "Don't worry I'm safe"
Didn't matter 'coz it's already to late
I was lost in the sauce, dead wrong and I ain't stoppin' now
Parlayin'' in the bush again
Didn't think about what I was puttin' in it

Go on and hit it, that's what it's made for
She said
("You got somethin' on right?")
That's what it's made for
Boo are you trippin', you know I got it
Thats what it's made for

So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
Know you gon' felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it but we gon' still get down like this

Best stay where you are, that's what it's made for
Playa, playa, put it down, that's what it's made for
Oh baby turn around, you know I got it
That's what it's made for

So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
Know you gon' felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it but we gon' still get down like this

I gotta go
Mm mm, you ain't gotta go nowhere
Look baby I, sun's comin' up, I gotta
Mm mm, just get it up one more time, let me touch it
Again?
Again and again and again
Baby look I
Come on, you know that's what it's made for
You want me to sweat it out?
I want you to sweat it all out
I'ma get it baby
Get it, take it
Okay
Take it
I'ma get up inside

That's what it's made for, that's what it's made for
Don't trip, I got protection, you know I got it
That's what it's made for

I'm gon' do you like this, baby
Oh you gon' freak you like this
Felt it like this
We gon' still get down like this

That's what it's made for
Oh, playa, playa, put it down

Too late to turn back now, you know I got it
That's what it's made for

Do you like this
Freak you like this
Felt it like this
Girl I forgot it but we gon' still get down like this

And that's only the beginning, God
I might as well just go to sleep here, damn
