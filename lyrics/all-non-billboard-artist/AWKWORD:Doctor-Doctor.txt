Doctor-Doctor:AWKWORD
feat. Guess Who


[Intro (Four Rooms sample)]
I haven't got a problem, I've got fucking problems!

[Verse 1: AWKWORD]
Doctor doctor, I think I need some drugs
All this therapy and still, can’t go to the club
All these plastic waifs, spilling they cosmos
And they plastic dates, get pissed like vamos
You look like Drake, muchacho, cuidado
I was just tryna peep if they had AWK on Serato /
Doctor, even when I’m sober I’m bugged /
I’m a magnet to the shit that fucked-up people does

[Hook: GuessWho? & AWKWORD]
Life is life, you can’t choose what you get, but um...
Got problems? You can choose how to step to them...
Doctor doctor, sit me on the couch cause I...
Got problems, it’s the stress from this life of mine...
Life is life, you can’t choose what you get, but um...
Got problems? You can choose how to step to them...
Doctor doctor, sit me on the couch cause I...
Got problems, it’s the stress from this life of mine...

[Verse 2: GuessWho?]
I’ve been through the ringer to bring you the middle finger to life
I’m no singer so I figured I’d write
Bout when Dad start to argue again, and then
Moms pick up the bottle, got a problem with him
My little sister crying, plead, begged and she prayed
That all this shit would stop, then they sent us away (peace)
Mother wanted out, of the fire like a Phoenix
Pops held it down to the max, yo believe it
Good to the bad flip fast bet your head'll spin
Off. (Pops.) Sick looking like some medicine
Shit, write a script, now he sick with the germ
Momma really lucky didn’t get into her
So I flipped out, started fights, plus I drank a lot
My demons in a panic always strike when the hanger's hot /
Gen X psycho, formed from a troubled youth /
Ask the effing question, Guess to the W

[Hook]

[Verse 3: GuessWho?]
Told you where I came from, grew in a violent home /
Boo hoo, woe is me, born alone die alone /
I make 'em scream and they asking for me /
Beyond capacity, people pack it in to see /
I move too fast for the black cloud to follow /
Cut my own path now pass me the bottle /
It only gets worse as you pour it goes hollow /
So you could live your life or sit in sadness and wallow

[Verse 4: AWKWORD]
Doctor doctor, I think I need to be seen
I’m addicted to weed, pills, caffeine and nicotine
We go out for drinks, I knock back 15
When we get back to the crib, I eat the cabinets clean
Most of my friends get fucked up for amusement
But I wake up with an hour of sleep, coughing and puking
My liver probly damaged, I know the solution
But I do these things to hide a higher form of confusion
I’m constantly depressed, never relaxed
Always in grind mode, but I take it to the max
I set my own standards, tryna save the whole earth
I been fighting the man, before I even knew the jerk
So now I hate my job, and I wanna hurt my boss
Feel like I'm walking a tight rope, might hop off (wooh!)
Doctor doctor, I think I need some more help
I refuse to choose what Jesse did and kill myself (Rest in peace Jesse)
