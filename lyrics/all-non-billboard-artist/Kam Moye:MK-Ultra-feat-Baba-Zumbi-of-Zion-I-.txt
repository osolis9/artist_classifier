MK-Ultra-feat-Baba-Zumbi-of-Zion-I-:Kam Moye
(Intro)
At this very moment,
we are fightin' for our mind, body, and souls!
They're poisoning our generation...
They['re] trying to take control!

This is toxic and poisonous:
to gain a greater profit, they're destroying us with slick marketing.
Buying off a[n] impulse would pose big problems.
Major corporations might as well pick-pocket 'em.

Selling us big dreams, our memories lock it in.
To some of us, going shopping is like oxygen.
Psychological war, snatching lives of the poor.
On Black Friday, you beat the line at the store.

It's a damn shame how we turn our nose when the truth is told.
And I can(?) drop kicks, niggas turn groupie-hoes.
We'n lose our soul and all virtue...
You see the way we['re] glued to them Super Bowl commercials!

We['re] forkin' over cash for SUV's and fast cars,
'till this bad economy gave us a crash-course.
Tellys (televisions) in the dash board, we can't afford gas for it,
but the TV advertisement was that gorgeous.

(Chorus)
They jack our mind-state from us,
in the end who could we trust?
This is MK Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra,
Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra...
Our minds, our body, they stole from us,
so watch out this is dangerous!
This is MK Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra,
Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra...

They put poison in our system, feeding you a lifestyle.
People won't believe it 'till they['re] body's going lights out.
Cats better pipe down, it's no joke.
There's a young brother dying from a fatal stroke right now!

I ain't trying to bash fools, but I ain't bashful.
Everything is ass-backwards, now that cash rules.
Ain't it crazy how these niggas want to laugh at you
for trying to eat healthy while they['re] suckin' down fast food?

A billion people served daily bullshit to eat.
Even the young's targeted. You think differently? [Come on!]
It's amazing; before my kids could even read,
one single word in the paper, they knew "Mickey D's."

And they could quote the order back to me, descriptively. [What?!]
Something about it don't sit with me. [That's right!]
I can't stomach it; this ain't a commercial, it's real life!
You could say I'm outta my mind, but still it feels right.

(Chorus)
They jack our mind-state from us,
in the end who could we trust?
This is MK Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra,
Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra...
Our minds, our body, they stole from us,
so watch out this is dangerous!
This is MK Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra,
Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra...

Super-scientific in the reaches, ba-rain (brain).
It's real deep, like Middle-East war games.
But this is no game, see what the aim is:
take the mind out [of] the body, you['re] brainless.

MK with the Ultra, black.
Yeah they gobble little niggas like "Scooby-Snacks."
And eat your soul out, before you're sold out.
Now you got a couple hoes and (holes in?) a gold mouth.

And on TV, we watch the Jones'.
See if we can be fantastic poseurs.
They feed us square(?), that's all we know.
That's why it's so damn hard for the youth to grow!

In a mode to explode or break out,
they want to serve me like Chinese take-out.
But ain't no catching me, on a melody, (jingle?)
my destiny: F-R, to the double-E (FREE)!

(Chorus)
They jack our mind-state from us,
in the end who could we trust?
This is MK Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra,
Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra...
Our minds, our body, they stole from us,
so watch out this is dangerous!
This is MK Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra,
Ultra, Ultra, Ultra, Ultra...
