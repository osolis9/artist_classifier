Don't go there
MY BITCH!

I'm diving and ducking
The BS
I'm sorry, I can't be
Your BF
I just bought, Your GF
Some knee pads
No romance, Just VVIP tags

What's on my plate I can't pronounce it
What's in my cup I can't just down it
What's in the blunt I can't describe it
What's in the text is just a lotta shit
Tell every woman she's the finest
Adjusted her to the blackest stylist
Closet full of that geh! geh!
Yeah bro I'm having designer
Securing bags like I'm hiking
I get the bag like its class time
She left the house with a ring on her
And showed up to me with a tan line
I made the house without a bling on it
Diamonds drippin' like its that time
Diamonds on me need a tampon
Millions on me I'm a champion
Yeah

Young Nasty he the baddest in it
Need a pair of wings just to catch him slippin'
Need a pair of twins to give my attention
Need em both ways this a baptism
I'm only turning 20 years old with it
They call me king and I just roll with it
This is me versus just everyone you know with it
(And I ain't never been a hoe with it)

But me & paps back & forth with it
He don't know what "comes with the works" is
Clearly a misunderstanding but I still love him
More than all that I'm worth with it
Ex person still bitter yeah
Ex person still broke yeah
We can't even share joke yeah
She fell in love without a rope yeah
