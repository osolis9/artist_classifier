Lyrical-Tactics:Natural Elements
* I assume this also appears on a Natural Elements 12", I don't know which

Yeah yeah, this the group, this the group
You're listening to the sounds of Natural Elements, know what I mean?
We gonna do it like this, check it out

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
will I eat M-C-E-E
N-Y-C be the locality... tryin to inflate this low salary
My sets is fat and yours is low calorie
You're too full of carbohydrates, to flow my rate
I shake and vibrate, the lightweight, and make foes migrate
Plant seed and let it germinate, vermin I terminate
Verbally I offend more *niggaz* that the Mark Fuhrman tapes...

Yeah yeah, this the group, this the group
You're listening to

Yeah yeah, this the group, this the group

Yeah yeah, this the group

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
will I eat M-C-E-E
N-Y-C be the locality... tryin to inflate this low salary
My sets is fat and yours is low calorie
Too, full-too full of carbohydrates, to flow my rate
I shake-rate vi-light-brate, light-making, make late migrate
Plant seed and let it germinate, vermin I terminate
Verbally I offend more *niggaz* that the Mark Fuhrman tapes
I burn this great when I get busy, the crowd ask what is he
Human or robot, my flow's hot, those that know not
must be dizzy, so, how many fingers do you see
You goin up one, what, two, uh, three cause I knocked your ass silly
Of course I'm livin Big but who the hell is Willie?
Try to peel me, and I'll put you on the floor quicker than Tyson did McNeely

Aiyyo, once you hear the Capital A, rappers stay
Went through for a while son, it won't go away
Composin dramatical plays, Element Natural ways
Control your thoughts like, sniffin crazy thoughts, four-oh quarts
Stay dipped, in Polo Sport menswear
A-Butta be the one you and your friends fear
Natural E, we droppin gems here
Shinin for ten years, and keep writin until my pen-pen gets
gets ink upon the paper, rhymin the flavor-flavor
Too high-too higher than a skyscraper, my blades-blades
deacon-deacon, my thoughts connectin like, when my beeper's beepin
You stay sleepin, A's creepin, I'm makin mics parade-parade
New jack new jack when... the mess
While you procrastinate, I graduate, past your rate
You see my flow'll fascinate, Natural E, we collaborate
Check it cause rap is great, Wiz, scratch it up like cissy fights
Butta, forever shine like, New York city lights

Keep risin to the top
No one can stop we
Natural Elements
We'll forever S-H-I-N-E
(repeat 2X)

Yo, physically I bring the pain here, for shorties wet like rain gear
I hit you buck fifty, like New York city train fare
Yo eryday I rock the same gear, cause money low, I bag a honey doe
This one go out to all my sunny bros, in N-Y-C
Northeast Bronx, my territory
You confess to a priest, writing lyrics is better for me
Never sweat a shorty, now I'm broke, got no sort of hope
But in the future, when I got money, I'll be adorable
But shorty played herself, like brothers on the train, usin a portable telly
Cause both of y'all look the same, like Aaron Hall and R. Kelly
I bust a shot like Marbury, battle?
You must be sniffin somethin like, Darryl Strawberry
Check what I get nice with, my right hand is what I grip a mic with
In the future, I circle numbers on this Lex priceless, but yo
Me gettin burnt or hurt, won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the UHHHHHH, forget it I'm constipated

See these lines be like graffiti burners, Essence tags your mental hall
as I come bust aerosol meets flame, into your face with no shame
Rappers be talkin like they rich when they be ridin the train
And when they flow you know it all sound the same
Repetitive like escalators, plus sweeter than Now and Laters
Your clout about as much weight as a sheet of paper
You have no flavor, pullin my saber, removin you
from the agenda wannabe pretenders Fall like September through November
Get open end to then, verbally dismembered
Remember Essence flows, I'm treatin you like Mendel
From Bolo, to get dough, see the mic you need to let go
Your high-low, you can't rip it with expertise
Please, this MC, put simply is a G-O-double-D-E-double-S
You cannot contest

Keep rising to the top
No one can stop we
Natural Elements
We'll forever S-H-I-N-E
(repeat 2X)
