Groove-With-the-PC:Poison Clan
1: jt money
Once again it's the clan with a fast one
To make y'all groove like the last one
Niggas were demandin' the pc to come back
With deep bass and funky ass drum tracks
Poison boys takin' over the club again
Makin' that shit y'all love again
While suckas tryin' to get our style
Of true niggas from miami's underground
Jt, a nigga you can get with
Kickin' that hardcore fly shit
Sendin' this one to the niggas in the bronze
And them hoes with them dazzey dukes on
Slangin' that monkey, stacked, lookin' chunky
And caught gettin' funky
Jockin' the money man, so ...

2: jt money
Step on the scene with my steel-toes
Holdin' my dick, lookin' for them ill hoes
A nigga like jt be trickin'
Lookin' for a hoe to stick my dick in
Holler at the boys, see what's up with them
They always put a nigga down with the (?)
That's jockin' jt, one raw nigga from the pc
Kickin' the shit that be thumpin'
In a club, that's all you hear pumpin':
The poison clan sound
Hoes' pussy poppin' and doin' the doo-doo brown
And the niggas be wildin'
Fuckin' with the hoes and cold profilin'
So if you're down with the money man, just ...

Spreadin' like a virus, backed by the money-man
