Rest-Of-My-Life:Jason Derulo
I'm not looking for a fairytale
Don't need a queen for the night
I'm not addicted to the fiction, of the picture perfect life
But I confess I'm ready, I found the one at last
And if your heart don't skip when you're next to me, you can be the best I never had

I wanna look out in the crowd and see your face shining out
If That's a little too much to ask but I could, I could care less right now
Ain't gonna stress no future pain
You probably don't even know my name
But I'm pretty sure that we both been through it
And one day soon you're gonna hear me say

You're one for the money
And I'm two for the show, you never looked so pretty
I've never been so lucky, I know
Is it okay if I stay here, and fall in love tonight?
Is it okay if I stay here, for the rest of my life?

I know this all sounds crazy, but what the hell why not
If you come a little closer, I'll give you all that I've got
I know we just met baby, it's you and I against the world
If you let me lay here, as if you were my girl

You're one for the money
And I'm two for the show, you never looked so pretty
I've never been so lucky, I know
Is it okay if I stay here, and fall in love tonight
Is it okay if I stay here, for the rest of my life

This is not a one night stand
I would be a fool not to love you again
I just thought I'd let you know, you're exactly what I've been waiting for
I could make you feel alive, let me be your fantasy tonight
All you gotta do is say the word and ill stay,
For the rest of my life

You're one for the money
And I'm two for the show, you never looked so pretty
I've never been so lucky, I know
Is it okay if I stay here, and fall in love tonight
Is it okay if I stay here, for the rest of my life
