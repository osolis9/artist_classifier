Frame-And-Fork:Buck 65
Cracked foundations leakingâ€¦
it's a fact that attracts rats 
mold grows, and that shit is whack
cause like, I need a space that's common theroyal
and chilled for me to write,
but we need the raw materials to build
and the right mixture ,of light fixtures 
and extra large windows of opportunity. 
where those of our community, come to pay a visit
you treat em properly,
while you break down the science
on the property value.
The buildings sick and dieing with a first class infection
if the health board people come we'll never pass inspection
the vital sides been neglected
calling off broken 
let me do the talking
cuz I'm calm and soft spoken
and buck 65
interior design should be simple and elegant
superior to the minds of the criminal element
unless you include graph writers
but still guys are marking places for parking spaces
before the floor is re-enforced
not even to mention boards are hammered in wrong
and with this tangle of extension chords
the next thing you know the roof will be on fire
killed in the smoke and the flames
that engulf the entire building
the carpenter soul
that wants the ability
the stain must first live up to the ability 
of keeping the premises safe from any nemeses or foreigner
that would only paint himself into a corner
