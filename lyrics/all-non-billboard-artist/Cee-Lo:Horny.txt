Horny:Cee-Lo
I, I'm horny
(Oh yeah)
I, I'm horny

I heard a dirty rumor that you were a friend of mine
I had to set 'em straight, in fact we're doing the deed
Your body gives faith to humanity
I hated all mankind
Your kiss, the cure to my insanity

Oh, 'cause you make me horny
(I love that mouth)
You make me horny
(And what comes out)
You make me horny, horny
(I'm all about, horny)

I, I'm horny
(Oh yeah)
I, I'm horny

Your love is like a tumor I don't want to be benign
Your love is like a hunger that a man want to feed
You're smoking hot without the vanity
You're my kind of daily grind
One kiss, a flame in my insanity

Oh, 'cause you make me horny
(I love that mouth)
You make me horny
(Ooh, and what comes out)
You make me horny, horny
(I'm all about, horny)
I'm horny

I, I'm horny
(Oh yeah)
I, I'm horny

Your body gives faith to humanity
I hated all mankind
Your kiss, the cure to my insanity

Oh, 'cause you make me horny
(Ooh, I love that mouth)
You make me horny
(And what comes out)
You make me horny, horny
(I'm all about, horny)
'Cause you make me horny
'Cause you make me horny
You make me horny, horny
(I'm all about, horny)

I, I'm horny
(Oh yeah)
I, I'm horny
