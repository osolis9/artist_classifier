What is rap?

It's the heart and soul
Of the niggaz, and these dirty red walls and toes
It's a story of the day we lost all control
Not the times we boss balled with hoes
Not the rhymes we crossed jawed with those
They flossed all they golds, and platinum too
Lemme school these motherfuckers on what rap been through
Whatever happened to, wave 'em side to side
Throw 'em in the air, lemme see yo' hands
Now we smoke and ride, niggaz ganstafied
Now all they wanna show is straps, ice, and brands
Niggaz might be fast, they mistreated enough
You think they need they own brother
To mislead 'em another inch
Lead 'em another inch, keep in most suspense
They need to just fuckin' fence, these people is so intense
And fecal like full of shit, the say that yo' shit is a hit
And play you a whole lot, but pay you a little bit
Once you make 'em a whole lot, they started shakin' the spot
They fakin' the whole lot, death to 'em
I pray for the day that God lay rest to 'em
If I was him I wouldn't send one more breath to 'em
But that's best left to him, I won't digress for trim digress
I don't dress fresh for them, I ain't impressed by bimbos
The devil can miss me with them hoes
Niggaz wanna build they career on videos
That ain't rap

We don't stop
We don't stop
We don't stop
