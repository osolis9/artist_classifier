Camberwell-Carrots:Jehst
CHORUS:
I'm the shining star
Lightning spark
Camberwell carrots
I can see the in dark
Cupid's arrow lodged deep in my heart
Love for the art
Gifted; the way I'm so swift with the dart
Lifting the cup
I'm a champion
You love to see me live it up
That's why I can't ever give it up
Put your hands together
Give it up!

VERSE 1:
Ain't nothing pretty in this city, for real
But we can put our heads together if you're willing to build
I see a vision of Elysian Fields
Another day in the life of Mr William Shields
We're slum villagers
Drunk off of miniatures
Fuck the ministers
And the crumbs that they're giving us
Behind the bars with political prisoners
Conspiracies to limit us to indigenous listeners
And tone down the content
Water down the accent
And dumb down the image on some Jazz-hand theatrics
Singing and dancing in a top hat
The belle of the ball
I keep it street like Top Cat
And Benny The Ball
Silique of a penniless fool
Living on the edge
Ready to fall
Down again
And this time I might not pick myself back up
Dust myself down, and put it down to luck
Life is a cruel mistress
She's down to make love
But she ain't down to fuck
Your body buckled by the pain
Struggling in vain, wondering how to maintain
Neighbours strung out on Crack-Cocaine
They switch-up the story
But the facts don't change
They remain
Simple and plain
It's no use
Groundhog Day
You stay stuck in the loop
And nobody's giving up the loot
Play to win
But it's Trivial Pursuits
False promises, and fool's gold
From out the cracks in the concrete
A stone rose
And freedom is so close I can taste it
But never close enough for me to fully embrace it
A lifestyle so basic
Let's face it
