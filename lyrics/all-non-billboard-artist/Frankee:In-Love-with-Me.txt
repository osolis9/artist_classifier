In-Love-with-Me:Frankee
Now if you wanna know 'bout me, I'm a bad girl
Like my guys, the same sharing my world
I'm not afraid of things, you would not believe
So you gotta come correct, you wanna be with me

You gotta make me smile, make me happy
Do the things I like, just to please me
If you don't really feel what I'm talking about
Don't even waste my time, you can step right now

'Cuz I know just what I want
Designer shoes that I can flaunt
It's not a crime to like nice things
Don't hate 'cuz I do it for me

Uh huh, uh huh, I'm in love with me
Uh huh, uh huh, I'm in love with me
Ain't nothing else that I'd rather be, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cuz I'm in love with me
Uh huh, uh huh, I'm in love with me
Living in my real life fantasy and it feels so good just loving me, ooh

I think you're crazy, cool and it's all good
And I'm diggin' you, you're official
But I dont really need a relationship
Just wanna have my fun, got a life to live

So I'ma call you boy when I feel like
Understanding me makes it all right
'Cuz I'm feeling good, let the sunlight shine
Don't piss me off, maybe you'll be mine

If its something that I want
Got much appeal, I throw it on
It's not a crime to have nice things
You can hate 'cuz I get it for me

Uh huh, uh huh, I'm love with me
Uh huh, uh huh, I'm in love with me
Ain't nothing else that I'd rather be
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh huh, uh huh, I'm in love with me
Living in my real life fantasy and it feels so good just lovin' me oh

And I'm always gonna please me first, feels good, so good
And if you down with me, no feelings hurt, feels good, so good
Wake up every morning with a smile on my face
If it's raining, I know that I'll be okay
Ain't nothing in this world could ever take this feelin' away 'cuz I
