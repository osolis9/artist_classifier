Is-It-You-Svpreme-Fiend-remix-:Cassie
I'm looking for a lover not a friend
Somebody who can be there when I need someone to talk to
I'm looking for someone who won't pretend
Somebody not afraid to say the way they feel about you

And I'm looking for someone who understands how I feel
Someone who can keep it real
And who knows the way, the way I like to it have my way
And I'm looking for someone who takes me there
Wants to share, shows he cares
I'm thinking you're the one that I've been waiting for

Is it you? Is it you? Maybe you're the one I've been waiting for
Could you be the one for me? Could you be the one I need?
Is it you? Is it you? Maybe you're the one I've been waiting for
Could you be the one for me? Could you be the one I need?

I'm looking for someone to share my pain
Someone who I can run to, who will stay with me when it rains
Someone who I can cry with through the night
Someone who I can trust who's heart is right
And I'm looking for someone

And I'm looking for someone who understands how I feel
Someone who can keep it real
And who knows the way, the way I like to have it my way
And I'm looking for someone who takes me there
Wants to share, shows he cares
I'm thinking you're the one that I've been waiting for

Is it you? Is it you? Maybe you're the one I've been waiting for
Could you be the one for me? Could you be the one I need?
Is it you? Is it you? Maybe you're the one I've been waiting for
Could you be the one for me? Could you be the one I need?

Someone who won't take for granted
How much I care
(How much I care)
And appreciates that I'm there
Someone who listens
And someone I can call who isn't afraid of love to share

Is it you? Is it you? Maybe you're the one I've been waiting for
Could you be the one for me? Could you be the one I need?
Is it you? Is it you? Maybe you're the one I've been waiting for
Could you be the one for me? Could you be the one I need?
