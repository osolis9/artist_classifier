Oh-Featuring-Ludacris:Ciara
This is where they stay crunk
Throw it up, dubs on tha Cadillac
White tees, Nikes
Gangstas don't know how to act

Adamsville, Bankhead
College Park, Carver Homes
Hummers floatin' on chrome
Chokin' on that home-grown

They got that southern cookin'
They got them fellas lookin'
Thinkin' I was easy I can see it
That's when I say no, what fo'?
Shawty, can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh

Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh

Buddy take a new whip
Paint strip, bowlin' ball
Still smoke unemsmote
Wood-grain on tha wall

Light-skinned, thick chicks
Fellas call 'em redbones
Close cuts, braids, long
Gangstas love 'em all

They got that southern cookin'
They got them fellas lookin'
Wishin' I was easy I can see it
That's when I say no, what fo'?
Shawty can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh

Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh

Southern-style, get wild, old skools
Comin' down in a different color whip, whip, whip
Picture perfect, you might wanna take a
Flick, flick, flick, flick, flick

Call up Jazze tell him pop up the bottles
'Cuz we got another hit, hit, hit
Wanna go platinum, I'm who you should
Get, get, get, get, get

Ludacris on tha track, get back trick
Switch on tha â€~Lac, I'm flexin' still
Same price every time, hot song
Jumped on, 'cuz Ciara got sex appeal

And I keep the meanest, cleanest
Baddest, spinnin' on stainless wheels
Could care less about your genus
I bump ya status, I keep the stainless steel

Trunk-rattlin' what's happenin', huh?
I don't even think I need to speed
Bass-travelin', face-crackilin' huh?
Turn it up and make the speakers bleed

Dirty south we ballin' dawg
And neva think about fallin' dawg
Ghetto harmonizing, surprising
Runnin' back, 'cuz tha song is cold

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh

Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh

Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh
