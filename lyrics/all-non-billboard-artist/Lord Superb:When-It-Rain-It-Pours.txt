When-It-Rain-It-Pours:Lord Superb
[Chorus 2X: Shorty Real]
When it rains it pours, You lost my brothers
How long will I mourn
It's gonna take a lot to ge through the storm

[Lord Superb]
Behind every strong man is a strong woman
Behind every old gangster is a young hoodlum
Go to jail, Turn blood to Muslim
They mostly do it for protection or the thugz'll book em
These bars are the verse of my life
From the womb to the streets all I heard in my life
As a child I felt my Mom's pain
Her death numbed my feelings like the effects of cocaine
As for Pops, His nod didn't mean he agreed with you
That was the effects of the diesel
Did a little bid and they killed my brother
Daddy was sharing needles, AIDS killed my Mother
Grandmother stepped up to the plate
First it was just weed and dust then we stepped up to the plates
And the mirrors and the razors, Lines was being snorted
When we was doing lines wasn't no rhymes being quoted
Then these five cent niggas get dollar bill
And Big Face, Up in the club he got killed
We drink till we choke, Nothing spilled
Except a little Remy and milk on my silk, Fuck it
We still rock Chuckers, More flavors, Description
We the encore, The major, We rock razors
Shotties under quarter filled blazers
______ was still dangerous, Fuck paper honor
Yo this ain't living, I'd rather be dead
Visit me at my wake while my eulogy's read
Perb was a G in every sense, Gully goon gangster
Gardener, He made flowers bloom on paper
They always said he was ahead of his time
And every word he spoke was ahead of his mind
They said they'd taking out his brain
His thoughts is the blueprint
And after his funeral they let Bill Gates use it

[Chorus w/ Lord Superb ad-libs]

[Lord Superb]
I said the lies are something else, I just can't call him
Ghost be on my mind, I just can't call him
The pain from being broke is making me hungrier
These two week old hair cut's making me uglier
Damn the streets is got a nigga depressed
Nigga stressed, I can see the pain in my chest
Heart got too much weight on it
Then she said she get our check on the first
I'ma serve it and wait on it
Fuck, I'ma put the plate on it
Fuck it, Put an eight on it
I'm getting strained on it
Look see I aint gotta line I debate on it

[Chorus]

[Lord Superb]
Is this waste or is this hot, Should I say this shit
Do this block, Matter fact I'ma chill
I aint gonna sell that rock
I'ma just do my thing, Ride like Pac
