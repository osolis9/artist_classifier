This-Is-The-Girl:Kano
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh
Oh, ohh, ohh oh
Oh, ohh, oh, ohh
Oh, ohh, this is the girl that I want

Uncomfortable, it's been way more than a month or two
It's deeper than that I roll with you
So no other chick can't come close to you
And deep down I know the truth

Notice you don't like if I come with you
And chicks wanna hug me in front of you
But I don't mean to be rude
I won't find me another one quite like you

I know that we become so close
And I know I'm mostly on tour
With girls backstage after the encore
But I'm down for you, look out for you
(Down for you, look out for you)

Try my best to be around for you
(Try my best to be around for you, ohh)
And if you still down then I want you to know
You're the one I want when I'm gone

This is the girl that I want
This is the girl that's gon' make me fall in love
(And I ain't even wanna fall in love)

Girl, I will ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby, 'cause girl I've changed
(Baby, I've changed)
And this is the girl that I want

Oh, ohh
(You know how it goes)
Oh, ohh
(You know what they say)

Oh, ohh
(Old dogs)
Ohh, oh
(New tricks)

Oh, ohh
(Different toilet)
Oh, ohh
(Same shit)
Oh, ohh
(Well, let me tell you somethin')
Ohh oh

Look, I've been in a club many a times
Been a player, two girls at a time
Been a very bad boy like Shyne
(Too blind to see what you were doing)

I was involved in close
Hiding with a silent ring tone
Like Jude Law in Closer
Relationship roller coaster
(Ohh)
My life, my real life co-star
(Ohh)
With no dialogue we couldn't go far
(Ohh)

But I'll try and stop
'Cause so far, well, that won't last
(Too blind to see what you were doing)
I move so fast, spin round the track like go-karts

Over and over and over
To a slow stop, I'm so lost
'Cause what I couldn't be
You wanted me to be
(Ohh)

When I couldn't breathe
I wanted you to leave
(Ohh)
What you couldn't see
(Ohh)
Was me in the club with she
Looking like my wife to be

But finally, I've grown up since then
And your eyes opened up since then
And I've changed, so let's keep it movin'
(Too blind to see what you were doing)

This is the girl that I want
(And I really wanna let you know)
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love
('Cause I really wanna fall in love)

Girl, I will ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby 'cause girl, I've changed
And this is the girl that I want

This is the girl that I want
(And I really wanna let you know)
Forget 'bout all them other girls before
(Forget 'bout all them other girls before)

Wanna get involved with you
All them other girls ain't the same
With them played the game
And this is the girl that I want

Oh, ohh
(Ohh)
Oh, ohh
(Ohh)
Oh, ohh
(Ohh)
(Too blind to see what I was doing)

Ohhhh oh
Oh, ohh
(Ohh)
Oh, ohh
(Ohh)
Oh, ohh
(Uh uh)
Ohh, oh

Check on the canopy
My stamina be enough for Angelina Jolie
Actually I had to become a man
To be the man you see

And I know your fantasy
A baby and a family with me
I know how it sounds but believe me
That if I don't know how to be teach me

This is the girl that I want
(And I really wanna let you know)
This is the girl that's gon' make me fall in love
('Cause I really wanna fall in love)

Girl, I will ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby 'cause girl, I've changed
And this is the girl that I want

This is the girl that I want
(And I really wanna let you know)
Forget 'bout all them other girls before
(Forget 'bout all them other girls before)

Wanna get involved with you
All them other girls ain't the same
With them played the game
And this is the girl that I want

Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
(Too blind to see what I was doing)
Ohh, oh

Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
(We're meant to be let's keep it movin')
Ohh, oh

Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
(Too blind to see what I was doing)
Ohh, oh

Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh
(We're meant to be let's keep it movin')
Ohh, oh
