Legend:Nelly Furtado
Da dararara
Dadaraa darara
Bebebebe

He wants to be, he wants to be
With everything under the sun
He wants to be, he wants to be
With everything under the sun

And like a legend who rises and unfolds
  (Parap parap parap parap parap parap parap parap)
I cannot be his only one

He makes me feel, he makes me feel
  (Dabadabada dabadabada)
Like you used to, like you used to
  (Whoa)
He makes me feel, he makes me feel
  (Dabadabada dabadabada)
Like you used to, like you used to
  (Whoa)

And like a fickle flower when it first sees the light
  (Parap parap parap parap parap parap parap parap)
I cannot show just how I fight
  (Dream goes down)
And like a fickle flower when it first sees the light
  (Parap parap parap parap parap parap parap parap
parap parap parap parap parap)
I cannot show just how I fight

Babe I saw you walking, it was after midnight
Carrying nothing except for a flashlight
You wanted to be Romeo so low at my window
You wanted to be Romeo so low at my window
Will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
Will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
For I do not think you low though you bow to me so so
I do not think you low though you bow to me so so

I know you want to drink from the purest wine
  (I know you want to drink)
From the purest wine
But the drink is far more sour then you would ever think
  (Drink is far more sour then you would ever)
Think, think, think, think, think, think

He wants to be, he wants to be
  (Dabadabada dabadabada)
With everything under the sun
And she wants to burn, she wants to burn
  (Dabadabada dabadabada)
Hot like that sun, hot like that sun
  (Whoa)

Just like a legend who rises and unfolds
  (Parap parap parap parap parap parap parap parap)
  (Like a legend)
I cannot be his only one
(His only one)
And like a callous, cold, callous woman
  (Parap parap parap parap parap parap
  (Parap parap parap parap parap parap parap)
  (Like a)
She'll never see what she did done
  (Never see)
So like this legend that rises and unfolds
  (Aaa)
I'll never be his only one
