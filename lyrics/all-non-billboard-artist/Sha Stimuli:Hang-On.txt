Hang-On:Sha Stimuli
[** feat. The Astronomical Kid, Peter Hartmann:]


When I was 5 years old, I realized there was a road*
At the end I would win lots of pots of gold
I turned 6, learned quick, but I lost control
Around 7, the devil tried to bottle my soul
Then at 8 or 9, I saw I had a crazy mind, turned 10
Wrote my 1st lazy rhyme with no pen
Figured out I wasn't like them other kids when I was young
Teacher asked me what I want to be when I hit 21
I said "I wanna see 21, start my own business
Stack funds, live life until my living is done"
My teacher was stunned
I told her most people let 'nine to fives'
Define they lives look in my eyes I'm not the one
See I went from fragrances of pissy floors
to when you sniff me, you could smell the Christian Dior
I went from breakin' in my neighbors' Honda Accords
to breakin' records, laughin' at the loot I made before
Right now, all I gotta do is smile at the opposite sex
til I'm coppin' they checks and I hop in they Lex and go shoppin' and next
I'm massagin' they neck and I'm slobbin' they breast
and menage and molest they be like "Yo Sha you the best."
But that's the worst, 'cause all I need is a homegirl
Friend, lover, but I'm off in my own world
learned from my brother
I remember it was just him, granny, mom and me
now this year I'm a Grammy nominee, looking back I
wasn't getting love from the DJs
had to sell verses on Ebay
the industry thought that I was tryin' to be Jay
my family told me get a job at BJ's
hell nah 'cause I knew that I could spit ill
I'm in a race against time and it gets real
see this path I'm on, it's like a track I'm on
i'm runnin' in a marathon, trying to pay my sprint bill
My father instilled something when he left
'cause you stop living fast when you witness slow death
It's sunny outside
So how come my homeboy's soon to be bride keeps telling me she's wet?
That shit got me vex, now she sending him a text
sayin "Imma get some rest," while she kissing on my chest damn
I wanna push her on the mattress
start grinding like I'm Pusha T and Malice but I can't
Victorious told me since I'm a rapper it just happens
I'm the shit and the shit, it hits the fan
There's so much power and passion
in my verses, that my words may be louder than actions
I am not no bitter spitter, killer, killer dealing weight
and writing it on twitter, I'm really realer
I deliver shit to give you shivers
the internet got these beginners in the game and winning
hip-hop is finished, and I gotta wonder
Why these dudes are playing dudes disguised as other dudes?
They Robert Downey in Tropic Thunder
People tell me I'm about to blow
every time I leave the stage when we rock a show…
I'm thinking I need a kid, they saying I need a hit
what's a hit song without the doe?
a donation without the doe is a nation that's 3rd world
I'm Super Mario in the 3rd world
trying to get to 8-4, I left world 2
I should do a Joe Budden and film my girl too but
I would rather save the princess
dumb motherf–ker nickname me incest
I wanna live forever but it's not about fame
I believe in prayers but I gotta get paid
even Creflo got a dollar in his name
if I wasn't me I'd be afraid
Y'all know I drink 'cause I think too much when I'm sober
Betting on myself these days, I'm a high roller
I'm so nice, so mean feeling bipolar
Y'all listen backwards so I talk like Yoda
So hot, album is
Many records, Sha sold
Punchlines, deep shit, metaphors, wild flows
he has, spaz he does with eyes closed
enjoy you will, To keep, my soul.

Chorus

Hang on to the world as it spins around
Just don't let the spin get you down
Things are moving fast
Hold on tight and you will last
