Heart-of-a-Champion:Cognito
I don't play for the fame
I play for the green and gold
I play this game for the glory
The only way that I know
I don't play for the fame
I play for the green and gold
I play this game for the glory
The only way that I know
I don't play for the fame
I play for the green and gold
I play this game for the glory
The only way that I know

You see I got that eye of a tiger
Heart of a lion
Runnin through a hundred and sixty two games without even trying
All the fans that are hopin
October baseball is in Oakland
The minute the coliseum doors are open its smoking
I play for the story
I play for the hall of fame and all the great players that came before me
That play the game for the glory
That sweat green and play gold but love to
Giving these kids the game
Someone they could look up to

The crack of the bat
Memories of Bill King screaming get back to the track
That was in fact
The beginning of what we came to do
Time to ignite the bats again
When you a champion you tell the world

I don't play for the fame
I play for the green and gold
I play this game for the glory
The only way that I know
I don't play for the fame
I play for the green and gold
I play this game for the glory
The only way that I know

What does it take to become a champion
King of the diamond
Seventy two to seventy four and eighty nine
No need to remind them
Those are the years we made them have to believe
It's the day we known having the most dominating pitching staff in the league

There's no question where I'm at in the summer
I'm at the ball park remembered for having legends like Catfish Hunter
The boys of summer label us as the new era bash brothas.
Our motto is moneyball
You haven't heard the last of us
Baseball isn't just a game
It's a way of life
Day and night
If your jersey ain't dirty after night
you ain't playin right
So put me in coach
Cause I'm ready to play anytime of day
What do champions say

I don't play for the fame
I play for the green and gold
I play this game for the glory
The only way that I know
I don't play for the fame
I play for the green and gold
I play this game for the glory
The only way that I know
