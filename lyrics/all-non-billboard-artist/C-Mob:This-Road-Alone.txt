This-Road-Alone:C-Mob
I've been walking this road alone
No matter where I go, I can't seem to find
Something to believe in, nooo
But still I try to roam
Down this lonely road
Cause there has to be something
And there has to be a reason

Heart broken and hopeless, why can't they notice
Everyone thinks I'm doing good when really I'm at my lowest
Heart's at it's brokest, it's hard to focus
My only healthy outlet, is to take my pain out through each hope is
Walking alone in rain, I pray that the lord tells me to fear not
Let the rain hit my face, so I can camouflage my tear drops
I'm soaking wet, but a fire burns within me
Anger mixed with sadness and the flames starting to singe me

I've been walking this road alone
No matter where I go, I can't seem to find
Something to believe in, nooo
But still have try to roam
Down this lonely road
Cause there has to be something
And there has to be a reason

I don't know what to believe in
I've lost everything, I've been working so hard to support
I wasted my time, trying to be so responsible all I did was end coming up short
Everytime I finally put my faith in someone, they just cross me
So fuck fake friends, and wife they're too costly
I've never let another leave me broke and disparaged
And don't give me fucking started on that joke of a marriage
I lost my kids, now thats pain
I can't cope, I just bare it
If you ever get pregnant bitch I hope you miscarriage
I'm just speaking out of anger girl, I wish you the best
But if my kid catch a bullet, I'mma rip through your chest
Take a deep breath, calm down Chris you pissed
Cause your wife ran out, left you crying like a bitch
But when you think about it, Now you happy that she's gone
Only thang that fucking sucks, she took the kids away from home
How can I believe in love, when love rob me of my family?
Now I'm walking this lonely road, searching for my sanity

One foot in front the other, I keep moving
Even though I still struggle, I'm Improving
All the pain I've been through, Manifested a new entity
I have never been stronger physically or mentally
Never know the drama that I've been through, was meant to be
Maybe even one day an angel will be sent to me
I'm about to gather up my thoughts and boldly go
Where my feet, take me as I walk this lonely road
If my kids are with me, or not they're still family
All that I can do, Is to be the best father I can be
I'mma keep moving, thank God I'm still breathing
Cause everyone needs something to believe in
