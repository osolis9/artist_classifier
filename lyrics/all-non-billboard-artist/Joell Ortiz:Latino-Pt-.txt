Latino-Pt-:Joell Ortiz
Cry first and laugh last
Television was on, we never had dads
And the city was flooded with mad crack
Cause they experiment on minorities like we lab rats
Priorities, it's fuck authority
A man that can stand on his own and show maturity
I ain't ever ask for a loan, I've been supportin' me
Takin' cash from hoes like a sorority
Oh yeah they comin' for your life
Con Ed, I'm comin' for your light
It's bonded, I'm livin' out of spite
You ain't bleed then it wasn't worth the fight
I'm givin' y'all bread and water, ah bread and water all they get
And it ain't shakin' no hands, so fuck your politics
This isn't makin' a band, I burn a lot of bridges down
Then I played in the ash like fuck a following
All we ever wanted was good pussy and credit scores
Their own cars is better than all our rentals are
I'm sick of y'all, dudes switchin' and gettin' hot
Like Bruce Jenner and menopause
Ain't never told us detox the senators
I say they sent us to detox the criminals
So the minute that we pop his genitals
Emilio ain't gon' ever fall, I told y'all

Everybody pressin' charges, they ain't change where I'm from
It's no game, even Ndamukong Suh
Connect try to keep me out the loop
It's canine proof, all my birds in the coop
Niggas wanna see me in the cage (but why?)
My lawyer gets surprised with the money I save (ching ching!)
I'm low like Fetty Wap's left eye
I coulda sworn I saw Left Eye in Best Buy
Nike slippers, read the paper on the milk crates
Sippin' Arizona, I got stripes like a Zebra Cake
Believe me, fast money like a relay
Shopped in SoHo when Prince Street had replays
>D-day?
