We some X Everythings,
Some were on that trap, some rolled that dank
X Everything
He washed us from everything
Aye, he washed us from everything
I bought that, I bought that, I bought that "X"!
I bought that, I bought that, we some X Everythings,
I bought that, I bought that, I bought that "X"!
I bought that, I bought that, we some X Everythings!
Boy sold bleach
Boy sold clean
