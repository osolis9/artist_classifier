Higher-remix-feat-Kanye-West-Shawnna-:Do or Die
Yo Kayne blow the hook you a genius boy

Now when you hear this song you know it's on, baby girl
When you hear this song you know it's on, baby girl
When you hear this song you know it's on
I swear your lovin' got me so high I'm gone

Me and you baby girl like best friends
Let me hit you when I get the notion
On I 55 you and I
Let's ride hit the motion

Some say she freaky freaky
Let me guess your lidro needa
I'm hittin' through the back and curves
Hell, they sell the herb

Now open up your mind to this concept
Then you take one step
Straight from the feelin' of a wordsmith
That's the herb shit

Up on my 22 spin's
In my baby blue Benz
Girls say dat boys been actin' up
But thats the way he is

You lookin' good when you
Steppin' out a centerfold
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold
Let me hit you wit this dime in' the street game

Let a motherfucker go yeah, you know it
So now let me sugarcoat it
It's like I'm on that tight herb
And when I pull T the curb it's like, it's like

Your my latest and my greatest
My latest, my greatest
When you hear this song you know it's on, baby girl
When you hear this song you know it's on, baby girl

Your my latest and my greatest
My latest, my greatest
(When you hear this song you know it's on, baby girl)
Now when you hear this song you know it's on

When I'm layin' in the back of my 745
With my lips on you
Spittin' good game, with the hustler grain'
Gettin' brained like a hustler should

When I'm layin' in the back of my 745
With my lips on you
Spittin' good game, with the hustler grain'
Gettin' brained like a hustler should

When I'm layin' in the back of my 745
With my lips on you
Spittin' good game, with the hustler grain
Gettin' brained like a hustler should, hustler would

And you know when I hear the stuff
I'm still tryin' to hear this love what that do
It's like that baby when I mix it up
Baby girl you just got me sprung, what that do

Oh, yes she's one of the best
As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin'
Lurkin' searchin' for the virgin'
But when my baby girl it's workin'

Let me know what's that you smokin'
From the hands as I stick my tongue in
Then from the back but she want an autograph
But still we sexin'

Open back up last time
As I spit a little dough in my mind
She just like one of a kind
No C's no stand

Open back up last time
As I spit a little dough in my mind
She just like one of a kind
No C's no stand

Open back up last time
As I spit a little dough in my mind
She just like one of a kind
No C's no stand in her hind

She's just like me rappin' a line
Perfect let me drop in a dime
I'm on a roll again
I'm bought to blow again

Your my latest and my greatest
My latest, my greatest
(When you hear this song you know it's on, baby girl)
When you hear this song you know it's on, baby girl
(Just keep on liftin' me up, yeah)

No need to take another puff
'Cause your love has got me high enough
No, no, no, no, no, no
Just keep on liftin' me up, yeah

No need to take another puff
'Cause your love has got me high enough
No, no, no, no, no, no
Just keep on liftin' me up, yeah
