Straight-Mobbin:Seagram
Featuring gangsta p

Check this grabbing my gat strapped with an ak 47 me seag vell
Straight mobbing sending suckers to hell
On our way to funk vest strapped to my chest
In case a bullet hits my chest
So i can bounce right back to tax and wax...
The punks and show gangsta p can flow and go rambo...
As a killa on a realla and to the feds i only speak the no no
Cause i ain't the one to be bumbing my gums to the white one
I'm only down for dressing up in black
Make the hit as i get paid doing my thang
Me, seag, vell and el straight mobbin...

Niggas talking that shit need to like quit
Before a nigga go on a warpath and hit...
Like an avalanche, stepping with gangsta pat
Vell got a gat with a stack of new jacks...
And learners, i got my burners
And i'm ready to ride thinking about my partners who died
Madder than a damn psycho, no mercy tonight, bro
Got hennessy, not sipping but down in it for clowning
The streets are alive, they don't sleep, me and pat ready to creep...
To play a fool like crocket and catch a sucka outta pocket
Send his ass to the morgue cause the mob has scored
Fool, it's not over yet, seag causing rap threats
Starving for funk, seag's no punk, bodies in the trunk
Talking that talk, i tell pat something: take the bodies and dump'em
You know the gangsta source, on their moma's porch
You know, homie, thus rap is for gangstas only
(white folks trying to get up on the convo)
But it ain't happening tho'
Coming to my door with an indictment, starting a riot
But i ain't going out like that
I'm dying hard like i said in my first rap
Call me a menace, just wait till i'm finished
I'll take you on a tour of the ghetto, the black sewer
Blacks living like peasants, project tenants, african descendents
Mothers on welfare, no child care
Never heard of a 9 to 5 so seag strives

But back to the mob shit, making for sure hits
Bullets spraying, you can't dodge them
Me and pat straight mobbin...
