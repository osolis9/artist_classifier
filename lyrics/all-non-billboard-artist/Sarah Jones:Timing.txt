Timing:Sarah Jones
We met on an off chance one night
It was strange how the stars seemed to align
But I let the scene unfold before my eyes
Our paths kept crossing at the time
But I had a boy who I called mine
So I kept my distance but kept you on my mind

And then came the time
I was hoping, waiting for you
But I came to find
It was too late to try and find you

And maybe timing's all that matters anymore
It gives you hope but then it kicks you to the floor
No matter how hard I try
I still can't get you off my mind
Soon you'll be in a tux and bow tie
And I'll be cursing timing ‘til I die
I'll be cursing timing ‘til I die

You had bright blue eyes but I was blind
I was too caught up to even realize
And now you've got a girl and she's gonna be your bride

You gave me the time
But I looked the other way
I thought the time was right
But now you've gone away

And maybe timing's all that matters anymore
It gives you hope but then it kicks you to the floor
No matter how hard I try
I still can't get you off my mind
Soon you'll be in a tux and bow tie
And I'll be cursing timing ‘til I die
I'll be cursing timing ‘til I die

And I wish I could turn back the hands of time
And somehow make the situation right
I miss you, I wish you
Could give me one more try
I swear I'd let you in this time
Well maybe, you're already gone
And maybe my timing was all wrong

And maybe timing's all that matters anymore
It gives you hope but then it kicks you to the floor
No matter how hard I try
I still can't get you off my mind
Soon you'll be in a tux and bow tie
And I'll be cursing timing ‘til I die
I'll be cursing timing ‘til I die
'Til I die
