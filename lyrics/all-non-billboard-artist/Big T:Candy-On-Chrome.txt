souf side geez ride nothin but red

I get nothin but head
I drank so much I sleep wit ma cup in tha bed
all I gotta do is pop trunk to turn a head
im on 80 vouls and im actin bad
ma paint job wet like a maxi pad
they call me lil flip
mann! I thought you knew
im tha first one to freestyle 10 minutes on screw
me and big t in an escalade
like lil troy its a better way
I ride on chrome each everyday
every song I get dont get radio played
im only 18 but ma candy drip
if you got cavaties dont lick yo lips
tha freestyle king is ma nick name
I let ma bumper kit hang
while I grip grain
