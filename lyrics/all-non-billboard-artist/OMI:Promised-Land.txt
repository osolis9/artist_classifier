Promised-Land:OMI
I guess it's time that I run far away
I recognise all the things that's being said
I'm leaving this now
I'm leaving this now
I try to find a piece of pleasure in pain
I try to find the sun in the rain
I'm leaving this now
I'm leaving this now

Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope
My promised land
My promised land
Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope
My promised land
My promised land

I'm feeling at home, so I'll be gone for a while
And these streets, they allude me with a smile
I'm home again
I'm home again
I'm ready to do the things I've never done
I'm ready to show the world that I've won
I'm home again
I'm home again

Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope
My promised land
My promised land
Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope
My promised land
My promised land
