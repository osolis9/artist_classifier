Ugly People Be Quiet
Intro

   All the ugly people be quiet!
   But before we get this party started right
   Hey Cash! [Tell the people what you're the king of]

   Verse 1

   Just clap your hands, just make your hands clap
   To Marvelous the mic marvel, dictator of rap
   Get on the dancefloor, let me see what you got
   Cos the sound we're throwin' down it makes you wanna rock, ha
   Hurby Luv supplying the beat
   They make my rhymes sound fresher to the highest peak
   A-check it out, check it out, get down
   A wild style form of rap, my dazzling sound
   The style I'm reciting, just reciting my style
   The double words, words double but I call it wild
   So girl just keep grabbing, keep grabbing my tip
   Long as the money's flowin' everything is legit
   Cos my rhyme is on time, on time is my rhyme
   Already on top, ain't no need to climb
   And to the bone, he shocked the record down to the bone
   Call him Cash Cash Money but his name is Jerome
   The green-eyed brother, brother with the green eyes
   He shakes your booty, boom shaker from 9 to 5
   So listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
   People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet

   Verse 2

   This is a hard rocker that will rock your house
   Turn up your radio and stereo and check it out
   It's crazy wild and illy, bang boomin' your butt
   My name is Marvin call me Marv the wacky Marvelous nut
   The raving rhyme roller, rock roller that rolls
   Gettin' laid, stayin' paid so you know that I'm cool
   The stunning smashing super, super serious sound
   The devastating death defying dictator who's down
   The mighty hard rocker who's rocking your butt
   And everybody check him out, Cash Money's on the cut

   Verse 3

   Boy, I'm rough and I'm tough, never pullin' your bluff
   I'll turn a hard rock heckler to a cream puff
   Got rhymes and rhymes, gettin' better with time
   Hit so many def lines you have to rewind
   Play it back, listen, observe my rap
   Cos my lyrics are strong, and it's like that
   In Philly down the way, hard rockin' alone
   Marvelous and Cash Money, Marv and Jerome
   We make your party hearty and say [La-di-da-di]

   Verse 4

   Bass boomin', bass boomin' but I'm not done yet
   Gonna make it real funky on your def cassette
   My mic is sweatin' with steam, when I hear the crowd scream
   People, ugly ugly people is the name and the theme
   I'm the microphone master, money makin' man
   And I got more rock than Bon Jovi's band
   Cash constantly controls, corresponds the mix
   He's my homey, he's my DJ, he's my sidekick
   So as you listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
   People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet
