One-Day-New-Version-:Matisyahu
Sometimes I lay under the moon
And I thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray don't take me soon
Cause I am here for a reason

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because

All my life I been waiting for
I been prayin' for
For the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
There'll be no more wars
And our children will play, one day

It's not about win or lose cause we all lose
when they feed on the souls of the innocent
blood drenched pavement keep on moving
though the waters stay raging

And in this maze you may lose your way
it might drive you crazy
but don't let it phase you no way

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because

All my life I been waiting for
I been prayin' for
For the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
There'll be no more wars
And our children will play, one day

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence down with the hate
one day we'll all be free
and proud to be under the same sun
singing songs of freedom likeâ€¦
All my life I been waiting for
I been prayin' for
For the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
There'll be no more wars
And our children will play, one day
