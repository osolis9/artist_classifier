Line-It-Up:Pistol
I've got a heart full of cocaine
Nicotine stains on my soul
I don't need your permission
For my lack of control

Hey, hey, it's alright
The kids are gonna get high tonight
Hey, hey, now it's gettin' late
Gotta pocket full of money and I just can't wait

Line it up baby
Line it up, line it up
Line it up baby
Line it up, line it up

I've gotta a house full of nothin'
Nothin' is all I need
So many monkeys
Too many mouths to feed

Hey, hey, it's alright
The kids are gonna get high tonight
Hey, hey, now it's gettin' late
Gotta pocket full of money and I just can't wait

I've got a head full of 6's
I've got a head full of 6's

Line it up baby
Line it up, line it up
Line it up baby
Line it up, line it up

I said, line it up
Line it up, line it up
Gimme, gimme, gimme

I said, line it up
Line it up, line it up
Gimme, gimme, gimme
