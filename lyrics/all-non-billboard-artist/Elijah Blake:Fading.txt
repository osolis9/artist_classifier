Fading:Elijah Blake
[Verse 1]
She's got no soul but still young minded
Yeah she's got a habit for drinking and driving
She pour it up, her tears are falling down
Looking for love but no one stays around
The worlds on fire, it's so cold right right now
In her head, in her bed
She told her mama don't worry, papa don't preach
She only need knowledge to help her get sleep
Throw some syrup in the red cup
Watch she blowing on that cannabis

[Hook]
She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory

[Verse 2]
He's gonna go broke from selling dreams
Before she overdosed off of his amphetamine
Feeling none of the things that she felt before
Wonder what will it be like at times she never thought
[?] asking questions so deep
Six feet under but can't rest in peace
And they calling out for her but she's out of reach
Nobody wants to [?], that's already been [?]
And right now the highs are controlling the lows

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She's so gone, she's so far away
In a cold ass cell on the right side of heartbreak
Just like the autumn leaves fall, April brings the rain
Separation slices like a blade, but only generates the pain
How could something so clear become so vein

[Hook]
