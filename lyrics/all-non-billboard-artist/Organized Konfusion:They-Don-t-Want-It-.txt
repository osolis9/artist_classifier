They-Don-t-Want-It-:Organized Konfusion
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
Yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo, Duke, yo, son, check it
Y'all been, I been peepin'
A lot of people's steelos lately, y'knahmsayin'?
(Me too, no doubt, no doubt)

And, and, and thank, thank God, thank God
That to that point we here now and y'knahmsayin'?
(Right)
It, it's because of the people in the streets
And the people writin' in magazines and the people showin' us love
(Yes)

That's the reason why we here now 'bout to, y'knahmsayin'
Do our thing again
(One more time)
But, yo, there's a lot of individuals that be fakin' moves and fakin' jax
Like we can't get a little love, y'knahmsayin' when we spread love
(Right, right, right, right)

Y'knahmsayin'?
But I got yo on the straight up, I got a message for them niggaz
(What's that?)
They can kiss my fuckin' ass
(Ha, ha, ha)
'Cause on the strength, I really fuckin' feel they don't want it, yo

They don't want it, they don't want it
Them bitch-ass niggaz, they don't want it
Time and time again they rhyme about the same ol' shit
And when it comes to battlin', they don't want it

They don't want it, they don't want it
Them bitch-ass niggaz, they don't want it
Time and time again they rhyme about the same ol' shit
And when it comes to battlin', they don't want it

They don't want it
(Word)
Straight up, that's how the fuck I feel
They be frontin'
And shit like they can't give a nigga dap
(Fuck them, man)

Give a nigga love
Fuck that I hold my motherfuckin' ground, I don't give a fuck
I ain't gon' even say where the fuck I'm from
This is where I'm at
