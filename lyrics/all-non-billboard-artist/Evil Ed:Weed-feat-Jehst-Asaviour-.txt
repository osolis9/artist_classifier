MMMMMEEEEENNNNNGGGGGIIIII BUSSSS

So, when I'm fed up I get red up
Maryjane messed my head up
She can be my best friend forever
At times I regret that I met her when she eats all my chedder
But she makes life seem better
Like, whatever
Stressing me out, she settles me down
Put it in the air breh and spread it around
And don't abuse it
Re-using the temble ball from the pool as a mental tool
Meditating like we're meant to just the way God intended
When I pick up the pencil and scrawl the splendid
I used to use cigarette, mix and blend it
Now I don't taint the peng, everybody offended
If they criticise we defend it
Crystallized hydro-glistening
Blow my mind like nitroglycerin
This is the deal
All day, everyday, give you something to feel
We bun WEED! (WEED!)
Sticky green trees
Pick out the stalk, no stick and no seeds
We stay lean off this THC
9 Ounce to the bar
4 Bars to the key
