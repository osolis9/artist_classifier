How-Do-You-Like-Me-Now-:Toby 
I was always the crazy one broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one and the valadictorian so
Under your number I wrote, "Call for a good time"

I only wanted to get your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

How do you like me now? How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standin' here today?
I couldn't make you love me but I always dreamed
About living in your radio, how do you like me now?

When I took off to Tennessee I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and tore them apart

He never comes home and you're always alone
And your kids hear you cryin' down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringin' who could that be singin'
It's me baby, with your wake up call

How do you like me now? How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way
Do you still think I'm crazy standin' here today?
I couldn't make you love me but I always dreamed
About living in your radio, how do you like me now? Yeah

How do you like me now? Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy standin' here today?
I couldn't make you love me but I always dreamed
About living in your radio, how do you like me now?

Tell me baby
I will preach on
