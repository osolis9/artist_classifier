Candy-Song:Candyman
Candy Man, hey Candy Man

Alright everybody gather around
The Candy Man is here
What kind of candy you want
Sweet choc'late
Choc'late malted candy
Gum drops
Anything you want
You've come to the right man
Because I'm the Candy Man

Who can take a sunrise (who can take a sunrise)
Sprinkle it with dew (sprinkle it with dew)
Cover it with choc'late and a miracle or two

The Candy Man (the Candy Man)
Oh, the Candy Man can (the Candy Man can)
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)

Who can take a rainbow (who can take a rainbow)
Wrap it in a sigh (wrap it in a sigh)
Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie

The Candy Man (the Candy Man)
The Candy Man can (the Candy Man can)
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)

(The Candy Man makes everything he bakes)
(Satisfying and delicious)
Now you talk about your childhood wishes
You can even eat the dishes

Oh, who can take tomorrow (who can take tomorrow)
Dip it in a dream (dip it in a dream)
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream

The Candy Man (the Candy Man)
Oh, the Candy Man can (the Candy Man can)
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)

(The Candy Man makes everything he bakes)
(Satisfying and delicious)
Talk about your childhood wishes
You can even eat the dishes
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Who can take tomorrow (who can take tomorrow)
Dip it in a dream (dip it in a dream)
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream

The Candy Man (the Candy Man)
The Candy Man can (the Candy Man can)
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)

Yes, the Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world taste good
(Makes the world taste good)

A-Candy Man, a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man
(Makes the world taste good)
A-Candy Man, a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man
A-Candy Man, a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man
(Makes the world taste good)
A-Candy Man, a-Candy Man, a-Candy Man
