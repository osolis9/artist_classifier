Swipe-Feat-A-AP-Ferg:DJ SpinKing
[Verse 1]
Pinching me in the club, all the models around
Cheers to the bottel girl, all the models around
Roab me a brand new beat so I stumb when I come around
Fuck all my enemies, Imma stug when I come around

[Hook]
Got a couple hunnit on the swag
Put the baby on the switch lane
Got two rollie of the swag
Hold it, hold it swipe life, swipe life

[Bridge]
All of my identity
Whenever I put it down
Fuck all my enemies
Whenever they come around

All the time they come around

[Hook]

[Verse]
Having more guap in my gup
Skip it all up in the truth
And I might go off, I'm like uuh
Why I go off in the juice
Better be watching your tongue when you speak
Don't even talk to me please
I keep the banger on me
Swipe and get all of my cheese
I bought my mamma a new house
I bought my bitch a new dog
I put a trap in the house
Then would you talk to the Lord
Come throw with a bigger nigga
And I put it now, diamond on the finger nigga
And you know that bad bitches hanging with us
Couple rappers couldn't even get a tape with us
Couple hater niggas always said the favorite are with us
Can't sell the money, turn the tables on us
But fuck it Imma take the money [?]
Cuz I gotta keep her banging with his hundred wifes
Hunnits wife
