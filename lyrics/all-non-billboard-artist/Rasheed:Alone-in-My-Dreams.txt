Alone-in-My-Dreams:Rasheed
Bring the colour brush
Let me paint my world
I'll make it beautiful
like the rainbow
Go ahead mock me now it won't get to me
In my world you can't drag me down
It's been so long
Walking all alone
The road is so rough
But I already know
It's of no use to me if you say sorry
Cos I will still keep going on
I live alone in my dreams
A world that make believe
Trying to wake up from sleep
I think I'm falling deep
I live alone in my dreams
A world that make believe
Somebody wake me up please
When I fall asleep
Sometimes I dream I'm with a pretty girl
Sometimes I dream I'm winning Grammy
Sometimes I'm living in a mansion
That's the way I feel
But I've been sitting here sitting here since
Downing Downing too many a drink
The day looks bleak overshadowed by clouds
My heart is weak, I need to make it work
I live alone in my dreams
A world that make believe
Trying to wake up from sleep
I think I'm falling deep
I live alone in my dreams
A world that make believe
Somebody wake me up pls
When I fall asleep
Everybody wants a better day
We all searching for our daily bread
But things don't always go to the way we want it to
Somehow we just have to make it work
Everybody wants just a brighter day
We all looking forward seeing sunny day
But things don't always go to the way we want it to
Somehow we just have to make it work
But things don't always go to the way we want it to
Somehow we just have to make it work
I live alone in my dreams
A world that make believe
Trying to wake up from sleep
I think I'm falling deep
I live alone in my dreams
A world that make believe
Somebody wake me up please
When I fall asleep
