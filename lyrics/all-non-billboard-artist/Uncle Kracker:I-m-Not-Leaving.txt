I-m-Not-Leaving:Uncle Kracker
Another cigarette, whatever I can get
Everything I had I left behind
Pictures of the past things that never last
But satisfaction is, oh, it's state of mind

Somehow, someway
With nothin' left to lose
The past has got me
Searching for someone like you

Put another candle in the wind
It's just another thing that I can't fix
Play another game that I can't win
But I'm not leaving it like this

Maybe, I should find a common ground
Scratch another problem off my list
Go ahead and kick me when I'm down
But I'm not leaving it like this

Make another note
Letters that I wrote
I guess, you should've known
That I'd let you down

I heard it all before
I been through every door
But don't you be so quick
To count me out

You tried to knock me down
You kicked me in my head
You got me on the ground
But I'm not finished yet

Put another candle in the wind
It's just another thing that I can't fix
Play another game that I can't win
But I'm not leaving it like this

Maybe, I should find a common ground
Scratch another problem off my list
Go ahead and kick me when I'm down
But I'm not leaving it like this

You try to let me down
You kick me in my head
You got me on the ground
But I'm not finished yet

Put another candle in the wind
It's just another thing that I can't fix
Play another game that I can't win
But I'm not leaving it like this

Maybe, I should find a common ground
Scratch another problem off my list
Go ahead and kick me when I'm down
But I'm not leaving it like this

Put another candle in the wind
It's just another thing that I can't fix
Play another game that I can't win
But I'm not leaving it like this

Maybe, I should find a common ground
Scratch another problem off my list
Go ahead and kick me when I'm down
But I'm not leaving it like this
