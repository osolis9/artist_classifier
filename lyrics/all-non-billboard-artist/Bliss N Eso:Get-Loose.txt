Get-Loose:Bliss N Eso
Bliss n Eso Hijack bring it precise
singing it nice, fresher than a minger on ice
Yall up on this bitch start breaking something
Aint this bumping every fucking patron jumping
and this came from nothing Fuck radio airwaves
shit to say i got my head shaved
Bro thats fair play
To all my troops get your boots stamping
You give me boots slamming I'm a loose cannon
I found my companion Ism was so blind,
passed out on the shitter 5 minutes to show time,
You hoes fine?
Well even if you're not fly,
cock eyed with a head that looks like a dropped pie
Turn it clock wise on your volume meter
All you lads call out like you're calling Beamer
Waking up all you sleepers
shit's so fucking loud like we're bombing speakers
It goes: Grab your partner doe-see-doed
to the rhythm of the rhyming with the dopest flows
Yee Haw
my crew's sussing the stitch
Oh Yeah
Lets get loose up in this bitch
Grab your partner doe-see-doed
to the rhythm of the rhyming with the dopest flows
Yee Haw
my crew's sussing the stitch
Oh yeah
lets get loose up in this bitch
Are they ready for this?
I don't think they are
We ain't weightlifters but still came to raise the bar
Face it we basically state of the art
delegate you dangerous like demons playing the harp
