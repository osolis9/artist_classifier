To-Think-I-Used-to-Love-You:Uncle Kracker
You made me laugh some, you made me cry some too
You sent me off into a world of pain and made me someone new
You made all kinds of promises but only some came true
Now I know you need me more than I need you

To think I used to love you for reasons I don't know
You polished up my halo and I dirtied up your soul
I sure had a good time but we both know I can't stay
To think I used to love you but I'm leaving anyway

You know I'm not perfect and I tried to make you see
Somehow you though of everything but you didn't think about me
Lies and disappointment makes your world go round
It's to late save me so you might as well come down

To think I used to love you for reasons I don't know
You polished up my halo and I dirtied up your soul
I sure had a good time but we both know I can't stay
To think I used to love you but I'm leaving anyway

To think I used to love you for reasons I don't know
You polished up my halo and I dirtied up your soul
I sure had a good time but we both know I can't stay
To think I used to love you but I'm leaving anyway
To think I used to love you but I'm leaving anyway
