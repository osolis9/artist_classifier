Never-Giving-Up:B-Mike
You know
Through your whole entire life
You're gonna get put down
You're gonna get shoved against
But you gotta pull that bottom lip up
You gotta strive harder
And never give up
Yo

See I came up from the bottom as a hassling teen
Not a penny in my pocket all I had was a dream
And that might come off surprising but I swear it's the truth
From a third world country to a star in the booth
(No no)
And you could strip me from my pride and my smile
But I'll never be a failure I will never exile
Try to make me call surrender, nope, I never will dial
I will never throw that flag that's failing right in the air by your mile
I'm still here spittin' dope, still your head now fill with hope
I will never quit 'til the day that I D to the I to the E
Cause spirit grows
I'm still in touch with my dream even though it seems far
I suggest you do it, and aim for the stars
(Uh uh uh)
Try to make a name for my respectable state
And for my dream I'll catch a body if you get in my way
If you're discouraged by somebody stick those fingers up
And pull those other four down, you ain't giving up
I came so

I came so far
And I ain't about to throw it all away so I can give it up (ohh)
It may get hard (hard)
But I'm gonna keep on going 'til the day that I drop and that all
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
'Til the day I stop breathin' I'm not giving it up

Searching for direction in a place that has you headed low
Maybe it'll bring you up, maybe down, you'll never know
But what you know is that nobody can harm
Your self encouragement or effort but relax and keep calm
But wait that beat kicks in and your adrenaline jumps
That's when you bleed with persistence through your veins and it pumps
That's when your spirit will just levititate, never come in second place
Yesterday's irrelevant so raise your glass and celebrate
No I'll never let you bring me down or drop your lid on me
No you'll never break my spirit mentally or physically
Literally you gotta make attendancy to brilliantly detach the facts
And after act I'm breaking 'em down like symmetry
Tracks with rhythms, similes, I do it all so lyrically
Don't ever let a person try to paint your pictures visually
If you're discouraged stick those fingers up
And pull those other four down, you ain't giving up
I came so

I came so far
And I ain't about to throw it all away so I can give it up (ohh)
It may get hard (hard)
But I'm gonna keep on going 'til the day that I drop and that all [?]
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
'Til the day I stop breathin' I'm not giving it up

Lookin' for that day that has me screaming at my pinnacle
Lyrically I'm killing every villain like they miniscule
Priming for that spot that's still anonymous, honest it's
Time to find a goal and never quit so you accomplish it
No I'll never fall cause I'll keep; keep getting up
And I'm not your average rapper
I'm not strung out and dead of luck
If you're discouraged stick those fingers up
And pull those other four down you ain't giving up
I came so

I came so far
And I ain't about to throw it all away so I can give it up (ohh)
It may get hard hard
But I'm gonna keep on going 'til the day that I drop and that all
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
I ain't never givin' up
'Til the day I stop breathin' I'm not giving it up

Came so far
I ain't throwing it away just to give it up
It just make it hard
Never giving up
Never giving up
I ain't never giving up
Day that I stop breathing I'm not giving it up, oh
