Ramparts-Live-:Kashmir
like this summer unsettled
and surprisingly grey
I'm supposed to be warm
but I'm tricked by a cold betrayal

knowing that your cold war
isn't over at all
seeing how you try steering a craft
that is bound to stall

nothing's in your way
and no one's out to save you
so you can wither by the wealth
or you can catch up on yourself

so fed up with the good face
to spare us from knowing
what we already know
and the faces we are scared of showing

you have all that you had
now it's time to give up
and leave that miserable struggle
you once thought your love could stop

nothing's in your way
and no one's out to save you
so you can wither by the wealth
or you can catch up on yourself

nothing's in your way
and no one's out to save you
when your world is coming down
and your ramparts hit the ground
