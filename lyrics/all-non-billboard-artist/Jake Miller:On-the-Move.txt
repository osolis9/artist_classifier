On-the-Move:Jake Miller
Yeah. Haha. We going old school on this one. Let's go
Yeah. Uhh. Yeah, let's go

Ain't no stopping us now, we're on the move
Yeah, I'm on the move. You can hear me on the radio or watch me on the news, like
Ain't no stopping us now, we're on the move
Yeah, I'm on the move. All these labels wanna sign me, I don't know which one to choose.
Yeah, I'm on the move. All these labels wanna sign me, I don't know which one to choose.

Aiyo, I'm always on the move, something different everyday
Tonight I'm on the news, after that I'm on my way
To Power 96 cause they say they wanna play
My newest track that I finished earlier, today
Upgraded from a dorm to a hotel suite
No more sittin' in class, I'm in the first class seat
Flying to the city, all these labels wanna meet
With the kid that everybody's tryna sign like a receipt
I'm the hip hop Bill Nye, always in the lab
Mind's so sharp that my brain got stabbed
Phone's blowing up, think I just got tagged
Oh wait, it's just another kid who wants to collab
Got photoshoots and interviews literally everyday
Nothing that I haven't done, you can check the resume
These the memories that nobody could take away
And now my name's gettin' out, Double Play

Ain't no stopping us now, we're on the move

Aiyo, I'm always on the move. Going here and there
People see me out in public and they stop N stare
I'm taking the cards life deals me, Solitare
And I'mma win every hand 'til I'm a millionaire
Putting college on hold, people tryna ask why
I'm making the most out of life, that's why
Plus I'd rather be a star than a frat guy
And work hard to get bigger than a fat guy
A couple months ago, I was a no name
Used to stalk celebrities at the Heat game
Gave my mixtape to Chris Brown, and Mac Maine
To Rick Ross, and Khaled, and Weezy, and T-Pain
Now the labels that they signed to
Are callin' me back saying "we wanna sign you."
Kids that used to hate saying "I'm behind you"
And now they tellin' me I'm sicker than The Swine Flu

Ain't no stopping us now, we're on the move
