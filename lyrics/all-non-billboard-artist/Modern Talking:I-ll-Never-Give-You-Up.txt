I-ll-Never-Give-You-Up:Modern Talking
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
My promise last forever
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
We tie our dreams together
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up

Baby I know that I'm hurtin' you so
But I can't stand the pain, I can't let you go
What are you doin' the rest of your life?
Without your love I can't survive
Said to myself, "I can't let you go"
We're gonna make it, baby you know

I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
My promise last forever
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
We tie our dreams together
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up

I got what I want but I lost what I had
I need your love, you're drivin' me mad
Whatever will be, oh my baby will be
I miss you like crazy, you're my destiny
I  was so wrong, don't say goodbye
We're gonna make it, give me one more try

I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
My promise last for ever
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
We tie our dreams together
I'll never give you up

I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
My promise last for ever
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
We tie our dreams together

I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
My promise last for ever
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
I'll never give you up
We tie our dreams together
I'll never give you up
