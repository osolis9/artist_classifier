I-m-Shittin-on-Em:FunkDoobiest
I can do the somber like in November
Then rock a crowd while I'm in my pajamas
Like Tito Puente, I am muy Caliente
Fuck Kunta Kinte 'cuz Son is the Sensei

I funk with the black belt, you better step back, hell
I can Get Smart just like Agent Maxwell
I don't give a fuck, G, hey hey, we're The Monkees
I'll rock a rhyme to the end of the month, see

I go on and on like a marathon
I sing like Sarah Vaughan but like the underground
I flip through some Kung-Fu, you know that I've come to
Freak the ill shit, you just can't undo

Son, get it funky, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em

I can get symphonic like Harry Connick
Or the Philharmonic, I'll drop atomic
Vocals, solo like Sonny Bono
I got you babe, but who's got the Pornos?

I'm iller than a wino, I'm not an albino
I charge like a rhino, you put me in a [Incomprehensible]
When I rob shit, bomb shit, some say I'm obnoxious
I don't give a fuck, I'll make you feel nauseous

Row, row your boat, gently down the street
I'll take you all out with my funk doobie team
I got the skills, kid like Rumplestilskin
I put out gold, get smooth like Jackie Wilson

Singin' soprano
Move to the piano
Hey, where's the [Incomprehensible]
Our shit will be in [Incomprehensible]

Son, get it funky, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em

I shoobee-do-pop, hip hop like Sinatra
I spray my Binaca then shake my maracas
Hey, it's the swinga
Fuck a humdinger with a finger

Yo, it's the ultimate singer, Kumbaya, yo Kumbaya
Like Belafonte but what's Del Monte?
I kicks the flava, the ill funk behavior
Sick like polio, wild like a rodeo

Out there in Kansas, punk, check the classic
Get your ass kicked, so hop in the casket
I'm rockin calipso, who's got the Nabisco
I cook like Crisco, I pump the ill disco

Son, get it funky, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em

Son, get it funky, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em, shittin' on 'em
Son, get it funky, yo, I'm shittin' on 'em
