Pew-Pew-Pew-Feat-DJ-Qbert-:Run the Jewels
[Intro: Killer Mike]
I'm a rider and provider and I don't tolerate ho shit
I Bun B out on MC's meaning I obliterate yo' shit
Every time I try to like a rapper they turn and do ho shit
Make me ski mask on they ass, Run the Jewels in motion

[El-P]
You looking at the guy who the guy who that you think that I got my style from got his own style from (what's up)
I came with a side wink to this shit prim with a pimp lip and a vile tongue
I'm a brooklyn son, set adrift in a chemtrail sky
Bad guys knock when the doors are locked, no shots left, better pray to God
Not one to be talking the same shit, I am just impossible
Got a right to be hostile, motherfucker life is a coffin, then you lie in it, you're awesome
Every single moment you spend in the dirt is a worse time than the last moment, own it
We don't know you don't know shit, me and Mike will straight write your obit

[Killer Mike]
And the obit goes like this: "Here lies a punk bitch who a fuck boy type
Who ain't about shit, as soft as his momma's own tit"
His sensitive ass he says oh, let me click, real bust out beat
She fuck my clique, obscene, absurd with the words, I cleaned up curbs with the blood
And the bones of you nerds, I kill with the mic and murder with words
I'm known on the corners where murders occur, I cruise in the verse where murderers lurk
When god in the building, who they gonna hurt

[El-P]
Not a butterfly but a bee word gettin' heard
Got a third rock from the sun clean for the turf
Never learn, never love, give your brain to the purp
Get a hearse for the worse at the autumn start
With a curse on her heart that will heart till it turns

[Mike]

Bttt Stick, Bttt Stick
Let that four fifth turn and twist em
If they all got the mark we miss em
I pray death come quick and kiss em
If he need help I assist him

Follow, all of my tips is hollow
I could kill your ass today, but right now I'm playin' Grand Theft Auto
Brain check
I'm just come through your hood, and just shoot your ass tomorrow
Brain dead
Scattered over the hood of my lady's brand new auto
Man, knew I should have kept a G and drove my Monte Carlo
Here go
My disses shake your piss, I'll shoot your ass again tomorrow
Bang!

[El-P]

Ok, I'm an asshole, kiss me
Good luck
Break a leg in a bear trap, skippy
Wasn't in class when the lunch bell rang
Due to Colt 45 plus smoke got shitty
Mike already a help assist with me
Tag team of the god damn century
I never asked for shit, it ain't in me
You go to work now, but the style haunts history
No doubt I'm a dead fuck with me
Liberty bell cracked, the cops aren't kidding
The rabbit the hat is all deaf now in it
Came for the freedom, stayed for the prison
Came for the women, stayed for the money
Presidents are better worth dead to feed tummies
You came for the praising, stayed for the fucking
The money's on the side of the bed, it ain't nothin
