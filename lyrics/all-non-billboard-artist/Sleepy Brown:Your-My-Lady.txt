Your-My-Lady:Sleepy Brown
God might feel a little ahead in me
His most beautiful angel's laying next to me
Could somebody pinch me cause it's like a dream?
Uh, because you brought heaven to me
You're my lady, gonna say it again
You're my lady, oh
Just you and me baby, oh, oh
Cause you're my lady,

It's like a beautiful flower about to bloom
It's like watching the sunset and see the moon
I wanna pray to God please don't take me soon, oh
Cause all I want to be with you
You're my lady, I'm say it again
You're my lady
You and me baby, oh, oh
You're my lady, oh
You're my lady, sing it one more time

You're my lady
You and me baby, oh, oh
You're my lady

So could man once say, uh, uhu,
You're my lady
... some good man say, uh, uhu
I love you baby, love you baby
Oh, oh, some good to me
