A-B-Twizzle-Intro:Dee-1
Ayo, this your big dog, A&B; Twizzle, holler at your guala
In the booth with my big, big homie, Dee-Uno, Dee-1
And we here to talk about free lunch and Sallie Mae
All my life I got free lunch
Gumbo and grilled cheese, hot dog and a mystery chilli
Billy Kidd stared at me
Mum never sent me to school with a Ninja Turtle lunchbox
What school's our baby?
We danced to the music, you would have paid the piper
Sallie Mae, and she said ain't nothing for free
You want that knowledge?
You want to be something in this world?
You want to conquer?
You got to pay what you owe, baby, I need them coins
As we sit down here in the N.O., them kerns
So I say Sallie Mae, how you doing?
You looking for me?
Good luck with that, you knocking on my door
You're sending my e-mails
You just saying everything for free but it ain't, baby
You got to get what you got to get
You got to get your hustle on, you got to get your grind on
Or you gon' be paying Sallie Mae for the rest of your life
You got to be something with yourself
Get off your tail and daddy ain't going to get it
The Sallie Mae, she coming for you
Ayo, she run faster than the police
She taxing you more than them judges
She want her money right now
She worse than the Uncle Sam, IRS, taxes, them feds
She ain't playing with you
She said she wants that loan money
Or she coming with that Strong-Or
And she come and get it right
If you don't get it right, your line's going off
You know what I'm saying?
That car gets repossessed
She gon' find a way to get a way to get you
I was like, "Sallie, Sallie
I thought you needed a little bit of money
Because I needed a loan", Allie, Katrina
I ain't had nothing, I needed a loan to better myself
I've been trying to cover me
I'm trying to get up out of this shit-dirt
Up out this shit-gutter, up out this shit-hole
We call it N.O., I'm trying to better myself
