Right-Now:John Cena
Yeah, you can't help but feel it
Can't help but feel this one
Uh, uh, uh, yeah

Excuse me for a minute while I lighten the mood
Just clap with me like the lightning do, yeah
A bit of soul food that you be bitin' into
And if you feel me then I'm writin' for you, uh, uh

Right now put another coat of wax on the ride
For a minute put the beef and the gats to the side
'Cause this track's got a vibe to chill to
Enjoy life for 5 minutes, man it's not gon' kill you

It's okay to be hard and stay true man
But at the end of the day, we all human
This one's for you, the ones that you close to
Show some love, it's what you supposed to

Right now, forget the ends and the Benz
Pop a cold one, man toast it wit'cha real friends
Call your folks, tell 'em you tight now
'Cause everything lookin' pretty good right now

[Incomprehensible]

Right now baby, we all gon' ride
So place those things on your hips or side
The soul vibe gon' change, give way with fame
But sometimes the moral change or stay the same

Relax baby, right now you here
And sit back baby, with a round of beer
And cheer to those friends who crowded near
For those passed on in spirit they there

It's gon' be what it must, break bread wit'cha crew
If you got kids take the crust
It's all love baby, tell your girl she's strong
And whisper in her ear after dinner it's on

And take it slow baby, 'cause everything real
When you at family dinner y'all enjoy that meal
Thank God that you healthy and you keepin' it tight
And keep your dreams lighthearted when you sleepin' at night

[Incomprehensible]

Yeah, and right now I'm showin' love to my brothers and my old man
To my girl, "Let's get it on" like the slow jam
To everybody that I'm runnin' down the road with
Y'all my family, I know that you know this

Fox, Rock, B's and Chaos
Y'all growin' up with me man, true to life players
Grandma or grandpa watchin' up above
Trademark you my heart cousin, nothin' but love

Thanks momma, for all that you was
You a strong arm lady baby crazy with love
My sister raised me, those are the facts
And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed

And right now I'm blessed no stress no less
And thanks hip-hop for givin' me back focus, uh
Yeah John, what can I say?
It's all love from day one, you showed me the way

[Incomprehensible]
