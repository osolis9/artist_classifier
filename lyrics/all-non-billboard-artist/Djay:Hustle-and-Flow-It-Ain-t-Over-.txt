Hustle-and-Flow-It-Ain-t-Over-:Djay
Look this is my life, and it's a battle within
I gotta survive, even if I'm sinnin' to win
And if I show no remorse, I reap the devil's reward
He said he'd, give me riches, but I'm lookin' for more

When I was young, witnessed my dad, standin' for right
Black pride in him, even though he passin' for white
Took years from my life, now I'm missin' the man
Moms on some other shit, and now I'm missin' the plan

And so I'm, stuck in this fuck-the-world mode
All the lessons to a young teen nigga was cold
Then my pimpin'-ass uncle, put me up on the game
It really ain't no love, it's 'bout this, paper mayne

Put me in a position, got me out on a mission
Collectin' from the hoes turned me on about pimpin'
A nigga from Memphis, dealin' with life as a struggle
This is the gift I was given, so I just live by my hustle

([Keep hustlin' (Hustlin' hustlin' hustlin' ]) It ain't over for me, no it ain't over for me
([Keep flowin' (Flowin' flowin' ]) I'ma step my game up and get what's comin' to me
([Keep hustlin' (Hustlin' hustlin' hustlin' ]) It ain't over for me, no it ain't over for me
([Keep flowin' (Keep on flowin' ]) I'ma step my game up and get what's comin' to me

Now I'm just gettin' by, and it's fuckin' with me
See others doin' big thangs, they was nothin' to me
I'm seein' what I used to be, and it's lookin' legit
Got my hands on some music, started fuckin' with it

Put it down hard, then I started bumpin' to this
I let some others get a dose, and they was nuttin' to this
Let me check my connections, 'cause we go back in the day
Say they was lookin for 'dro, heard I was hustlin' hay

Got me connin' my niggaz, spittin' game to my hoes
This my opportunity, I feel like anything goes
I was never 'sposed to see, the new millennium mayne
And I refuse to let my dad, die in vain

So I give it my all, you feel my struggle and pain
If you ain't feelin' what I'm spittin', trick you late to the game
But the closest ones to me, know I'm holdin' it down
You gon' feel me one day, we gon' be heard in the town

([Keep hustlin' (Hustlin' hustlin' hustlin' ]) It ain't over for me, no it ain't over for me
([Keep flowin' (Flowin' flowin' ]) I'ma step my game up and get what's comin' to me
([Keep hustlin' (Keep on hustlin' ]) It ain't over for me, no it ain't over for me
([Keep flowin' (Keep on flowin' ]) I'ma step my game up and get what's comin' to me

([Keep hustlin' (Hustlin' hustlin' hustlin' ]) It ain't over for me, no it ain't over for me
([Keep flowin' (Flowin' flowin' ]) I'ma step my game up and get what's comin' to me
([Keep hustlin' (Keep on hustlin' ]) It ain't over for me...
