Deliver:Chino XL
Yeah, to all the real hardcore motherfuckers
Soft motherfuckers with the bitches
That don't give a fuck

Now who wanna diss to get they reps a little bigger?
How many bitches wanna fuck this yellow nigga?
You get your whole crew cut like a scissor
Watch this world shake from the album I deliver

I threw a Brownstone at Brandy now she's Changing Faces
Standing in my Aaron Hall I'm Blackstreet packin' suitcases
Goin' back to Indiana, on the subway, Soul For Real
Miss Jones is my usher in church on Sundays

Clear the runways, 'cause I'ma make you rappers my examples
Avoiding battling me like I'm Eazy-E's blood samples
It's me and Carey, nah never wrote no rhyme that's ordinary
Won't throw my life away on Coke like Darryl Strawberry

Removing you skeletal system playing your ribs like xylophones
I'm nastier, leave you scraped and ashier than Larry Holmes
But ladies I ain't always violent
You could pump, pump until the dawn, like Adina Howard

Can't you see, I'm notorious as Total get
Uptown Girls in bed, like Billy Joel do
Laverne and Shirle
Give us any room we'll break it

Remember you was wack, remember Ice Cube had a Jheri curl
Bam! Dead on your car horn, chump
My beat get messy as abortion on the ninth month
Now who be that, slap, did I do that?

Now Whoopi Goldberg goes Steve Urkel
But I'll leave your grill the color purple
Give you a Dogg Pound, could even Dru Down
Provoke me album is weak your whole shit sound like karaoke

Conversation, loss of limbs amputation
Head meaning decapitation rough like Craig Mack derm abrasion
Evil tendency, strong like Miles Davis heroin dependency
Fuckin' up lives like teenage pregnancy

Now who wanna diss to get they reps a little bigger?
How many bitches wanna fuck this yellow nigga?
You get your whole crew cut like a scissor
Watch this world shake from the album I deliver

Them clowns like Will Smith got fast cars and fancy homes
But I'm headstrong, I could even break Puffy Combs
Some kids still doubtin' and they girlfriend stalkin' keep it real
We'll cross that bridge when we come to that Anita Hill

Now Everlast, will never last, with no ghetto pass
Leave you breathin' hard like bitches at Lamaze class
Niggaz are slippin' when they sippin' gin and tonic
Smokin' chronic Jersey niggaz packin' more handguns than Harry Connick

My style is welfare, half of you bitches is on it
Was born with a halo, when broke, I had to pawn it
I stir up controversy and sell I'm like Sister Souljah
So bring out bum-ass, Russell Simmons 'cuz comedy's over

The Lucci I'm worth is enough to deficit a nation
With media coverage like a hostage situation
(Yeah and if you lovin' them hoes you better bounce back)
Tryin to make that bitch your wife she fucked

The whole New Jersey Drive
(Soundtrack)
High like Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jams on tour
I rips it like a chainsaw, dig deep as truth go ahead
And shoot your Karl Kani suit in shock absorbing tired and

I'm wide like a police informant
Pray with one eye open, shootin' more Led than Zeppelin
Dysfunctional like the Jackson's, death is my obsession
You comin' through with thirty cowards think you causin fear

Rush lookin' bust in your boosted Donna Karen gear
Now fuck the po, po, beats down the five-oh
Been there, done that, do it again tomorrow nigga
Sometimes I vibe inside a spot where nobody else knows me
Until I come hot steppin' like Ini Kamoze

Now who wanna diss to get they reps a little bigger?
How many bitches wanna fuck this yellow nigga?
You get your whole crew cut like a scissor
Watch this world shake from the album I deliver
