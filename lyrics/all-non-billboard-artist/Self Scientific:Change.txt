Change:Self Scientific
(feat. Sway)

[Intro:]
Yeah
See What It Is... Is, The Whole World Is Fucked Up, Muthfuckers Need
Change, Thats Just Real

Yeah
Ride With Me Y'all
Come On, Change With Me Y'all, Yeah Yeah!
Uh Huh, Change With Me Y'all, Uh Huh

[Verse 1:]
Change Bring Another Melody
Lack Of Funds Brings Another Felony
Lack Of Money In The Ghetto See
Niggaz Do Crime To Quick Fix The Deficit
The President Builds Bombs To Increase The Deficit
Rise In The Millitant Forms To Sane Millitant Force, Outlines Los Angeles Law
Same Millitant Forces Riddin Pale Horses
Givin People The Propaganda Of Good Service
Lip Service The Whole Nation Is Nervous, From Old Ways That Come Back
To Murder Us
Been Two Years We've Been Lookin For Bin Laden
And We Ain't Find Him, Now We Got Another Problem In Saadam

Change Bring An Understanding, They Wanna Change The Last Part Of The
Planet To Aim Democratic An
Change For The World To Unite, Stop Livin The Lie, Start Speaking The
Truth, Who's Willing To Die
For A Little Bit Of Truth, Who's Willin To Try
For A Little Bit Of Change, Bust Sluggs In The Sky

[Chorus:]
We Need Change In The Government, Change In The Schools
To Change The Whole History Of Racist Views
We Need Change In The Home, And Change In The Hood
Not A Change For Worst, But A Change For Good
We Need Change

[Verse 2:]
Saadam Got Caught And Forced To Surrender
Many Realised Now He's Just A Sand Nigga
Tony Blair Wasn't Rollin, And They All Just Watchin
Never Caught Him, But You Barely Hear News On Bin Laden

Here's The Facts...
They Accepted The Patriot Act To Stop Terror, When We The Only Targets
For Those Weapons
Meanwhile The City Is As Hot As It's Ever Been
The Media Say It's War Between Niggaz And Mexicans
Now Thats Something That I Can't Understand Or Wouldn't Conceive
Black And Brown Come From The Same Seed
We Need...

[Chorus:]
Change In The Mind, A Change In The Soul
A Change In The Body To Make My Life Whole
We Need Change In The Streets, A Change In The Way That We Think
I Need Change To My Family Can Eat
