Self-Control:Frank Ocean
[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make it shine last night?
Could I make it shine on it last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blinded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
[Chorus: Austin Feinstein]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control

[Chorus:Austin Feinstein + Yung Lean]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
