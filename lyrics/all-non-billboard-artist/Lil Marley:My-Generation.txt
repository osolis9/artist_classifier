My-Generation:Lil Marley
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change

Now mi love fi see the schoolas dem a graduate
A study hard and save the party for the holidays
Diplomatic with dem diploma and them bound fi great
Because dem nah pick up no matic and a perpetrate

And then I love the energies whe dem a generate
My generation it so special, it will make a change
Because the elders sew the seed and it a germinate
So anytime dem see the progress dem a celebrate

Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a we a star the show like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true without apology

The mission ha to carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe, Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli
And everybody want a future living happily

My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change

Can you blame my generation, subjected gentrification?
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation
'Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation

Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements
What's up with your motto? Will you lead? Will you follow?
Improve your values, education is real power, I reach 'em like Bono

So get rid of yourself sorrow, add some bravado
Get wealthy likes Wells Fargo, it's truth that I am you
And I am proof, surviving through
We do what we gotta do

Yo, we could break the cycle let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
'Cause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds

My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change

If you weather that storm then that rain bring sun
Been a long time comin', I know change gone come
Man, I gotta keep it movin' to the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son

But they thinkin' that my generation gotta die young
If we all come together then they can't divide one
Don't worry 'bout it, just be about it
Got a message from God, heaven too crowded

But I say, "Hey, young world, you've never looked betta"
And I heard change started with man in the mirror, uhh
This generation, I'ma represent
A generation led by a black president

Now how's that for change, who knew that could change
I don't even look at the flag the same hey, uh
So when you finish readin' Revelations
Thank God for my generation

My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
