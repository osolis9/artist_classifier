All-I-Ever-Do-Boo-Part-II:Lemar
All I ever do

Now I am alone with you
This is what I want to do my boo
I wanna just to give it to you slowly
Work it to the early morning
As you call my name

After work, I'm so glad that you call me, And we spoke, through the night until dawn
As we spoke had to tell you my feelings And you said that you felt the same
Think it's time to get serious, only us
You told me what was on your mind
But something else is playing on my mind
can I tell ya

Now I am alone with you
This is what I want to do my boo
I wanna just to give it to you slowly
Work it to the early morning
As you call my name

Oh let's embrace, let's not waste precious moments
Tender kiss, softly touch on every curve
Dim the lights not to dark I want to see you
Lay you down and let the night, begin
I think it's time to get serious, only us
You told me what was on your mind
Now let me show you what was on my mind
can I show ya

Now I am alone with you
This is what I want to do my boo
I wanna just to give it to you slowly
Work it to the early morning
As you call my name
Now I am alone with you
This is what I want to do my boo
I wanna just to give it to you slowly
Work it to the early morning
As you call my name

Now your every wish
And your every prayer
Your every dream
I wanna make it all gone true
Can I make all gone true
Yeaaah
I love you

Now I am alone with you
This is what I want to do my boo
I wanna just to give it to you slowly
Work it to the early morning
As you call my name

My every wish, is to let with you
My every prayer, is to let with you
My every dream, is to let with you
My every wish, is now gone true

Now I am alone with you (My every wish, is to let with you)
This is what I want to do my boo (My every prayer, is to let with you)
I wanna just to give it to you slowly Work it to the early morning (My every dream, is to let with you)
My every wish, is now gone true

My every wish, is to let with you
My every prayer, is to let with you
My every dream, is to let with you
My every wish, is now gone true
