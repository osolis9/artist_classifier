I:Homeboy Sandman
i house runaways
i'm croc dunnaway
i ride bikes, no hands, hot summer days
this is not summerstage
this is not some mistake on some estate someone staged
this is like summer shade
these are not stunna shades
that'd leave sun ashamed
this is not for the change
this is not gonna change
follow my lead
introducing vitamin D
i been busy writing in meads
justifying the means
compliance in the mind of the meek
those are my enemies
it's just the mayan in me
my eyes closed vision is whoa
my whole coalition live by the code
which go "no gimmicks"
a ha a ha

("i" mad times)

i start a lot of verses saying "i"
why would i lie?
my oh my
i live and breathe the fight for freedom
a cinco de mayo guy
no teacher ever got me in single file line
i'd never bite a style or look in a style guide
i never would apologize for a pile drive
i knew it back when elway was playing at mile high
that i'd spend my entire life on the wild side
i'm stranded on a planet embarrassed to smile wide
i ain't the one for throwing salt, salt is iodized
i do not retire the time when orion rise
my aura appeal to all peeling orange rinds
looked cyclops in the eye just to show him that i ain't lying
i then stopped by goliath's to loan him my lion hide

("i" mad times)

i got a complimentary wardrobe
i got a brand new coat, human growth hormone
hold my ears and nose, garbage is so horrible
in my ears and nose, cartilage and not hard bone
i got bars, i got a barcode
here the kings that aren't from arco
no silicone, genuine article
i journey 'pon dreamscapes with no sleep
where i cash in on rebates, it gets so deep
i wander passed OGs sipping Ol' E
i holler out "hola" at the unholy
and people tell me "sandman watch your step"
ain't up on how i'm in touch with imhotep
dog, you to eager to ball
go fetch
yeahhhhhh

("i" mad times)
