Sleep-of-Innocence:Armageddon
Living in a purple shell
Kept away from danger
Drinking from the endless well
Feeding my desire

Where is
The secret place
Where is
The hidden cave

Rites of life in a learning day
Fools the man to laughter
Bringing down the masterplan
The journey's getting closer

What is the secret place
What is the living priar

The awakening
Sleep of innocence
The awakening
Sleep of innocence

Run into the walls
Embrace
Trembling far
From treasures

What is the secret place
What is the living priar

The awakening
Sleep of innocence
The awakening
Sleep of innocence
