I-m-Sorry-feat-Marlene-:Lil Tweety
You know what I'm leaving you
I told I cant be with you
You hurt me so much deep inside
And every night you made me cry
I don't know what else to do
I told you I was through with you
I'm sorry baby I'm sorry

Baby tonight I'm changin my life
Baby I'm sorry that I told you lies
I promise I change to be that perfect guy
That every girl wants in their lifes
Just give me a chance just give me a try
Promise to love you till the day that I die
I'm willing to change my hurting ways
I wanna erase those hurting days
Baby don't go baby just stay
Don't leave so low to drown in my pain
My feeling inside I'm going insane
And why would you say that you're going away
Lets talk this out don't walk away
Remember you did to me that day
I told you don't worry cause it was ok
You did me the same don't like this way

You know what I'm leaving you
I told I cant be with you
You hurt me so much deep inside
And every night you made me cry
I don't know what else to do
I told you I was through with you
I'm sorry baby I'm sorry

Thanks for this you woke me up
But my pain will choke me up
You tie me down I wont get up
I'll keep on tryin I wont give up
Til the day I have you close
I tried to fix what I broke
Cause what I did was no joke
I'm sorry for the hurting pain
It wasn't worth none of this
To lose my love and kids
What was I thinkin was I alone
Cause the ones that love me were waitin at home
What was I doing I ruined myself
The pleasure that gave me no measure
I just lost what I use to treasure
Its not me
It wasn't cleaver

You know what I'm leaving you
I told I cant be with you
You hurt me so much deep inside
And every night you made me cry
I don't know what else to do
I told you I was through with you
I'm sorry baby I'm sorry

So what am I to do
Can I get someones advice
I don't know what I did wrong
Some people wait their lives
To have someone like you
And I know I ain't that perfect
All the pain I put you through
All that you don't deserve it
Anytime for any purpose
You loved me all the time
When I was mean to you
You always calmed my mind
You never snapped at me
But now you're gone
And I'm beggin please come back to me
I'm sorry don't be mad at me

You know what I'm leaving you
I told I cant be with you
You hurt me so much deep inside
And every night you made me cry
I don't know what else to do
I told you I was through with you
I'm sorry baby I'm sorry
