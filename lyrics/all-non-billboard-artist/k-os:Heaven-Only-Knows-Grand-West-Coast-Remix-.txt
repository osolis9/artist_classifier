Heaven-Only-Knows-Grand-West-Coast-Remix-:k-os
Yeah, got it, the remix
[Incomprehensible], yeah
Turn this up, yo
Heaven only knows if they heard this
Heaven only knows if they heard me, yeah
You know what?

Heaven only knows
'Cuz I don't understand, understand now
Won't you tell me, please? Tell me
What's the master plan? Master plan

Spent so many days, many days
Sitting on a cloud, sitting on a cloud
Heaven only knows, only God knows
So I'll just move the crowd
Yo, tell 'em, tell 'em
Now, now, now

I break out my physical shell and excel
Past the so called body used to go to the party
But now I sit and chill with the pen and a pad
Dropping ill philisophical science

Me and my dad, we talk about life and how it started
How we departed from lights path and probable right math
The task at hand is makin' people understand
That we're not who we think we are

Within this land of lost the cost of souls could be so high, high
People be gettin' high, high, wonderin' why we die?
But it's all planned, right, to get your fear take the hand
We keep on returnin', 'cuz the lessons need learnin'

Concernin', what? The fact I sing and I rap
I hold this mic contact
Critics can step back and analize
I energise with cosmic rays of days they ignore
[Incomprehensible]

Heaven only knows
'Cuz I don't understand, don't understand
Won't you tell me, please? 'Cuz I pray everyday
What's the master plan? The master plan

Spent so many days, many days
Sitting on a cloud, sitting on a cloud
Heaven only knows, only God knows
So I'll just move the crowd
So, uh riddle me this
Riddle me this like this

Melodical prodigal flows, hypnotical blows to brain pieces, Telekenisis
When I reach this pinnacle cynical clinical
Microphone autobots waitin' on lotto spots
Tryin' to rock

But yo they can't understand
There's only one plan, the time is at hand
In the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to free the righteous children

Now, I know you want to be on top of the world
Givin' a diamond and pearl to your girl watchin' your jaccuzi swirl
Seems like material lust
We need to look up to the Heavens for imperial trust me

It's kinda hard when you rhyme sometimes
Everybody wants to scrutinize, redifine who you are
But every person is a star, so let your light shine far
And praise God

Heaven only knows, only knows now
'Cuz I don't understand, don't understand now
Won't you tell me, please? Tell me, please
What's the master plan? I wanna know the plan

Spent so many days, many days
Sitting on a cloud, sitting on a cloud
Heaven only knows
So I'll just move the crowd

If you feel this, uh
Sing it with me like
Sing it with me like
Everybody, uh
Sing it with me like

La, la, la
I'll just move the crowd for now
Gotta move the crowd
Gotta move the crowd
Gotta move the crowd
La, la, la
I'll just move the crowd for now

And Babylon cannot defeat them

If you free them, free them, they will start revolution
And babylon cannot defeat them
Mind revolution
