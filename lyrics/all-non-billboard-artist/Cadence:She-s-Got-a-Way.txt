She-s-Got-a-Way:Cadence
All you need is a beat,
That could make the ground shake
Add some swag with the hand claps
And build in that bass

Turn the tables and now it's original
Turn the tables and now you're unstoppable!
There's a flow when you know
That it's all in your hands

We can,
Make the world dance...

You got the music
You can do it
You got this
You got this
You got this
In the mix

Speakers blowin'
It's your own thing
You got this
You got this
You got this
In the mix

Turn it up
You got the stuff to
Make the music kick
You're in the mix

(Mix it up, mix, mix it up...)

All you need is a song, add the rhythm and stir
You can be, the best dj in the whole world
Hey singers! - bring your ooh's and ahhs
Hey scratchers! - get your turntables on

There's a flow when you know
That it's all in your hands

We can,
Make the world dance...

You got the music
You can do it
You got this
You got this
You got this
In the mix

Speakers blowin'
It's your own thing
You got this
You got this
You got this
In the mix

Turn it up
You got the stuff to
Make the music kick
You're in the mix

(Mix it up, mix, mix it up...)

Is there a dj in the house?
Is there a dj in the house
Cuz I need you now to
Mix it up and down
Turn the volume loud
Spinning song to song,
Going all night long
Cuz I can't do the party rockin' all on my own!

You got the music
You can do it
You got this
You got this
You got this
In the mix

Speakers blowin'
It's your own thing
You got this
You got this
You got this
In the mix

Turn it up
You got the stuff to
Make the music kick
You're in the mix!
