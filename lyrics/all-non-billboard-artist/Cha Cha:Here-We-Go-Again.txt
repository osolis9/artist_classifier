Here-We-Go-Again:Cha Cha
What? What?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, here we go again

I ain't the broad you want to curse out
Rip what's in the purse out
Oh yeah, you ain't heard how
The baby got nerve now

She think I like homie
Putting her ice-grill on me
Nice build on him and I might feel naughty
But I feel for him, when it's said too fake

Now he throwing me light meals
When he can't even pay my light bills for me
I ain't enticed lil' homie, got ice bills, show me
'Coz this nice deal holds me to this acting field nosy

I ain't the broad you wanna beef wit'
Better use what you sleep wit'
That language that you speak wit'
Will make you lose your teeth quick

Crushed velvet and sequins
You broads are just the cheapest
Same chick Kim said, â€½You'd find down at Freak Nicâ€
Hush puppy muse, oh enough I'm amused

Same chickens in sessions around Jagged & Absolute
Studio groupies is what I call that
Say it, 'cause that's how y'all act
Same chickens on the bra-strap
Actin' like we go all back, yo

Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, here we go again

Is it 'cause big girls be tough
Beneath the C-cups
Pull up to your club
Ten deep, three trucks

Rovers for the winner
With the seats heating up
Oh, the tint too dark
What's wrong can't see enough

'Cause hell when I show up
Didn't expect me to blow up
Advance like Boa
Now I want you to throw up

'Cause I'm the type of broad
That set a goal, reach a goal
Say three, 'cause it's reasonable
Then go gold, just regional, so

Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, here we go again

Oh, this where you broads gonna piss me
What you got against me?
Mr. Man stand wit' me
Get back you all quizzy

Call me charged as if I'm guilty, in a minute
I'ma simply snap my finger like a sissy
Tell 'em all where to kiss me
In the club, same thing

Now ain't that a coincidence
Now I'm the one you spill your drink on
Clumsy with chrissy, chrissy
These broads are fake, I know
But they gon' face cha though

I'm in a lace condod
Ballin' down the Lake Tahoe
Fellas with broads is trife now
But it costs my lifestyle

Sitting steady for a while
Just to figure your wives out
Put an end to these fits
Makin' it with a long kiss

Make her jam meet these fists
She f'ed with the wrong chick
Astonished, you want this
I promise I won't miss

And I get, miss, who she wit'?
Ice grillin' accomplice
She modeling from the Explorer
Think my man ex-whore

Had run-ins with her before
But this time here's what I told her
You know what?

Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up

Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up

Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Hot damn hoe shut the fuck up, here we go again

Thank you for making me who I am, thank you
