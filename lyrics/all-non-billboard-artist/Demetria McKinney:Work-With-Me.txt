Excuse me if I get selfish
You gotta forgive me
'Cause baby, I just can't help it
'Cause baby, I've been down for so long
Everything that I have now, I pray for it
And these niggas talking that shit, but all of you came for it
And I love you, babe
You asked me what I do, baby, I tell you

Its whatever, whatever you want
'Cause I'd be a fool to let you leave
I'd give what I have to make you see

But I'm saying please work with me
In the storm and the rain, baby
Please work with me

I know I get crazy but boy, I appreciate your love
That's why I call you superman
Boy, you making every day my better days
Anything that's hurt me, you can erase
You save the day and I love you, babe
That's why you need to know

Its whatever, whatever you want
'Cause I'll be a fool to let you leave
I'd give what I have to make you see

But I'm saying please work with me
