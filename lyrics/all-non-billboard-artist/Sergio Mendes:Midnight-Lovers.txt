Midnight-Lovers:Sergio Mendes
Hiding love till darkness falls
To play that night time game
Knowing it's the only way
Fill up empty days

The flower needs the sun
The rivers are made to run
And midnight lovers they gotta hide away
Yea, they gotta hide away
Cause they never had a love like this before, ooh
Never had a love, ooh
Never had a love, ooh
Never had a love, ooh
Never had a love, ooh
Never had a love like this before, oh baby

It's their love they wanna give
Such a simple thing
Broken hearted lovers know
It's a complicated game

The flower needs the sun
The rivers are made to run
And midnight lovers they gotta hide away
Cause they never had a love like this before, ooh
Never had a love, ooh
Never had a love, ooh
Never had a love like this before, oh baby
