Vibin:JR & PH7
All these niggas think they know my story
I'm alright, still the hottest of petori
Check my vibe, I've been rocking making waves
I'm alive, I'm the realest in the game
and That's why I'm

And I keep em singing on the streets
That's why when I drop a joint
I don't have to say, "It's heat"
