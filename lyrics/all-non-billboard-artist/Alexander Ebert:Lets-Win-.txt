Lets-Win-:Alexander Ebert
To the ladies of Vietnam,
Take my arm, and walk me in.
To the children of old Iran,
Take my hand, and walk me in.
Oh, dancing
Let's win!

And I hear myself screamin' for the Truth,
Everybody talkin' but I'm still confused.
In the dream I saw the kingdom we would lose.
And everybody singing love, sweet love.

To the women of Ghulu Choir,
Take me higher,
Oh fly me in.
To the children of Mao Zedong,
Take my arm,
And walk me in.
Oh, dancing
Yeah, let's win!

Do you know the way, the things to say,
The way to win the game of life?
Aaah, I should know better.
Do you have the time, the time is now,
To get your money house and wife.
Aaah, I ain't no liar.

To the boys of Uganda,
Come home
And walk me in.
To the children of no one knows,
Take my arm
And walk me in.
Oh, dancing
Yeah, let's win!
