On-On-Dance-Mix-Radio-Edit:Erykah Badu
Oh my, my, my
I'm feelin' high
My money's gone
I'm all alone

Too much to see
The world keeps turnin'
Oh what a day
Day what a day

Peace and blessin's manifest with
Every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth then
It would be well earned

If we were made in his image
Then call us by our name
Most intellects do not believe in God
But they fear him just the same

Oh on and on and on and on
My cipher keeps movin’ like a rollin’ stone
Oh on and on and on and on
All right to the break of dawn

I go on and on and on and on
My cipher keeps movin’ like a rollin’ stone
Oh Lord on and on and on and on
God damn it I'm a sing my song

I was born under water
With three dollars and six dimes
Yeah, you may laugh what
'Cause you did not do your math

Like one, two, three
Damn y’all feel that over there?
Like one, two, three
Y’all feel it over them?

Like one, two
In the middle y'all feel that?
Like one, two
Y'all feel that?

Like one, two, three, hah
The world keep turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day, what a day

The man that knows somethin’ knows that he
Knows nothin’ at all
Does it seem colder in your summer time and
Hotter in your fall?

If we were made in his image then
Call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but
They fear us just the same

Somebody said, "On and on and on and on"
My cipher keeps movin’ like a rollin’ stone
Oh Lord on and on and on and on
All right to the vultures swarm

On, on, on
My cipher keeps movin’ like a rollin’ stone
On, on, on
Mad props to the God jah born

I’m feelin’ kind of hungry
'Cause my high is comin’ down
Don’t feed me yours
'Cause food your does not endure

I think I need a cup of tea
The world keeps burnin'
Oh what a day

The mothership can’t save you
So your ass is gon' get left

If we were made in his image
Then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God
But they fear us just the same a cup of tea

On and on and on and on
My cipher keeps moving like a rollin’ stone
And go on on and on on and on on on why?
'Cause you did not do your math

Oh Lord on and on and on and on mash
My cipher keeps moving like a rollin’ stone
I go on, on, hah, on
And on and on

I think it's time to take the jam deep into the hype
Hard core cold hypin' the mic
I just so happen to be tough with a capital T
Ain't no weak ass trick MC keep up rough wit me

Hard on the mic, silly smooth with rhyme
You can read about Badu in your hip hop Time
You know I'm good to go since I'm up the part
Yeah I'm throw up the rope, they wanna play tug of war
Jealousy appears between both your ears
'Cause I been doin' this shit for years, hah

Never goin' out whack, I'm a female Mac
So sax get back, while my dollars stack
Potential buy knockin' freedom, but still hard to handle
Got it up top, don't watch the blank channel
Got soul, 'cause a monkey take a whiff of the jam

You're on with the song
Just say, "Thank you mam"

Cipher movin'
