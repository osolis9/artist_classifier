It-s-Hard-Part:Tito Lopez
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
Thie lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
This lonely life I live
Tryin' to be a rap star
I'm just a dope ass kid
Window seat in economy class
The steward is picking up trash
I'm tryin' to be fast
Ain't tryin' to be last
But it feel like that's
The place I'm in
When people don't see you
They don't recognize your face and grin
This place I'm in ain't the greatest pot
But it don't bother me
Losing my mind probably
Honestly niggas think I got this deal
And hit the lottery
Follow me, will it mold you and break you
Like you was pottery
Gotta be sad as a fuck
To be hot as me
I promise G, it's hard
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(This shit is hard)
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(I swear this shit is hard)
Thie lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(My nigga this shit is hard)
This lonely life I live
Tryin' to be a rap star
I'm just a dope ass kid
Different city on any given night
Every day it's a different flight
It's a whole different life
Catch me in terminal 2
Luggage and an iPod
Alone in my zone
Like when they reminisce over you
My God, is this what I really wanted
I could never condone it
She tat'ed my name on her body
To let me know I own it
And I'm still not convinced
I proceed with caution
Not even sure if it's mine
Paying for that abortion
Sex an extorsion, the worst crime
Should've got these bitches out of my circle
The first time
But most of these niggas addicted to estrogen
All I need is my mother,
My brothers, and next of kin
And I ain't seen 'em in months
There's just me and these blunts
Now I'm smoking that muds
That could be seen as a crunch
It's my dream and it sucks
How ironic is that
I feel like I'm on chronic and crack
I'm just tryin' to laugh
But shit is hard
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(This shit is hard)
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(I swear this shit is hard)
Thie lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(My nigga this shit is hard)
This lonely life I live
Tryin' to be a rap star
I'm just a dope ass kid
Window seat in economy class
The steward is picking up trash
I'm trying to be fast
Gotta get these words out my head
Before we land
Somebody paying for the studio time
Rapper's a job now, you understand
You complain one thing
And it never happen
It's more involved in this shit
Than just making music and rap it
Could make the greatest art beat
Yet and still you're not an artist
If you ain't dressing the part
And your sneakers is not the hardest
Niggas resent the skills
'Cause they never heard my name
Mad that I'm on TV
And work with the best in the game
Mad 'cause I make the music that I want
Young boy on some grown shit
Getting paid off my flow
Rhyme with my own clicks
So they don't post my videos on their dog sites
Tryin' to keep me in the dog
But I got these fog lights
Mama told me not to come
I'm on that three dog night
I know in my heart
That everything gon' be alright
But this shit is hard
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(My nigga this shit is hard)
This lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(For real this shit is hard)
Thie lonely life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope ass kid
(This shit is hard)
This lonely life I live
Tryin' to be a rap star
I'm just a dope ass kid
(This shit is hard)
Story life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope as kid
(Nigga this shit is hard)
Story life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope as kid
(Nigga this shit is hard)
Story life I live
Not a rap star I'm just a dope as kid
(Trust me when I say this shit is hard)
Story life I live
Tryin' to be a rap star
I'm just a dope ass kid
