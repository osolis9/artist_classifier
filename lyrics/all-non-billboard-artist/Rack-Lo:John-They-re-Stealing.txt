John-They-re-Stealing:Rack-Lo
Check it out, yo son, y'all remember one day right
We was walkin in this motherfuckin store right
There's this old lady in there, she was behind the cash register
I think her husband, it was just her, her husband
He was way back in the store right
Fixin some shit, I don't know what the fuck he was doin but
Me and Rack walked up in there right
I'm lookin at the leathers, and and
y'know they had some silks you could sell right?
Well then, after that, motherfuckin Rack
He grabbed the leather coat, fold it up, and he threw it up the back right
And as soon as he did that, all you hear was the lady screamin
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

Camcorders, and computers, from Crazy Eddie, 186th
My 'lo white cold, orange boxcutter, no icepicks
For the {?} rush at a quarter to six
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

In Macy's I got caught with somethin to cut wires loose
At Foot Locker I run out every time I try on shoes
Stealin meats from the supermarket
My moms axin me how come I didn't get a job yet?
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

Sometimes I find myself in dressing rooms
My favorite spot is Blooms on Lex'
Hit the {?} Hermans for Goretex jackets with reflectors
Accompanied by 360 professional store wreckers
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

Five finger discounts, I steal the mannequins
Window displays and Chinese stand wig mounts
Fruit stands, raspberries, responsible for 75%
of all stolen car batteries and hubcaps
Police once had a perfect sketch of me but they forgot my mustache
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

My bag hand just got knocked with 50% stolen merchanidse
in Riverside Square Mall
The other 50% is at the Taj Majal
Sold to Donald Trump, for personal checks
And Polo USA turtlenecks
In the bodegas we steal bottles of Becks and Heineken
{?} and special bag of pretzels
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Thirstin Howl III]
At Woolworth, walkin in
What risk, I was homeless
Stealin foot powder and deoderant sticks
Got sticky fingers, but it's all in the wrist
30 seconds to reach the exit
Dirty circus hunger, a repeated purpose
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

Security put a APB out on a thief
Associated to double L, for takin a surgeon credit card
{?} Brookdale, medical lab
Hijack a taxi cab like a mad arab
Off to Medina, I got a job for my Saigon spot cleaners
Move like hyenas
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Thirstin Howl III]
A Lo-Life, like Frankie Vaughn Clayborne
Couldn't find a reason for anything to be paid for
Klepto, like Ralph, and Rudy
Imagine what I'd do to a store without security
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Lo-Life member]
Dressed with a big pea cardigan
March in, in front of Madison Square Garden
Hittin pockets, amongst, {?}
On me as I'm labelled high risk
Wreck Poughkeepsie, and dissapear like a gypsy
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Thirstin Howl III]
If it ain't, tied down, it's mine now - keep it glued
I'll steal the ice out your freezer and leave the food
Take the remote control, and not the TV
Even pickpocket homeless people on the train while they're sleeping
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Lo-Life member]
Sybmols that resemble a case that's hoody
I feel my {?} bag to the top with CD's at Sam Goody, at King's Plaza
Oxygen pump for the asthma, on a paper chase
Go to Rickles and steal orange boxcutters and cans of mace
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Thirstin Howl III]
Antennas and cable boxes
And everybody's sneakers that came through Spofford
We vick different, in ninety-eight
I'm still stickin up niggaz for gazelles and sheepskin mittens
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

Full length, cookie raincoats, Polo horses
I stole a receptionist pen, when I signed up, for boostin courses
12 semesters of intense, concentration
Over the internet, I hacked in, top secret information
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"

Fuck video surveillance, it's critical
Don't think I don't know you on the other side of the mirror
In the fitting room
I carry a clean shave if you feel you need your whiskers groomed
Give you a scar that will be from about 3 blocks visible
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Lo-Life member]
With no sympathy, or regrets
You can't stop the bumrush, cadets in official Starter vests
In the Sports Authority, I took Goretex, for rainy days
For Gucci mansion, took my pictures like x-rays
"JOHN, THEY'RE STEALING!"
[Thirstin Howl III]
Snatching, wallets, and attaches
Habit of collecting lighters, and cracked ashtrays
And napkin holders from cafes
Silverware when it's rusty, you stupid enough to trust me
