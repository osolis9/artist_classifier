We sang this song
For all of us that have
people who are struggling with addiction
We sang this song 'cus we want you all to live
But don't waste your life man
Live
Live
Live
Live
It's always everyone else and never you
You keep lying to yourself, you're a fucking fool
We keep trying to help, you push us away
You gonna wake up dead with this game you play
You got one chance, get some help man
Maybe we should beat your ass and just check you in
The sad thing is
We don't want to see you die
You say you done getting high
Do I look like a fool to you
You said you had your last drink
Tell that to somebody else man
You checking in next week
And you expect me to believe that
You think your friends have turned on you
They Care Fucking 'Bout You Man
