Start at the back of my head
And peel my skin away
I'll show you there is nothing anymore
I've been dead for a while
Don't let this smile make you think any differently

And what I want and what I need
One more chance to live
Well I had it but I lost it
I choked on my last words again
I hope to see you soon

Tell me what did you see
When you looked inside of me
Was there a doubt to all my words
I've been dead for a while
You can check my file
Down the hall past the infirmary

And what I want and what I need
One more chance to live
Well I had it but I lost it
I choked on my last words again
I hope to see you soon

And all those times you could have sworn that it was in my grasp
And all those times I could have sworn I felt you beating in my chest
Well I had it but I lost it

Well I lost it all again
Well I lost it all
