This-Means-You:Black Star
Sometimes, you gotta be direct with the people
Y'know like give it to 'em
(C'mon)
Yo, give it to 'em
Get up now

Yo, we keep it type raw and know exactly what we fight for
When the nightfall come, we in the right war
Cats who spill blood for a cause, not just because
Defy the authority and follow God's law

Revolutionary entrepreneurs who make the fans
Clap they hands and stompin' the floor, not start the applause
(Ah, sh, yeah)
Thank you very much, without further adieu
Let me introduce the rest of my crew, Mos Def

Yo, I am the world renowned verb, adjective, adverb
Pronoun, preposition, suffix, prefix
Original or remix, sunburst and eclipse
Me and Kwe' combine like strands on a double-helix

My speech seasoned with dialect of my region
Booga-nam, Brooklyn, Bed-Stuy Eastern
Where youth and policemen, they nah reach agreement
Pressure in the mornin', pressure in the evenin'

Hi Tek on the beat, brothers and sisters

You, need to get up, right now
And move with this, yes, this means you
You, you
Yeah, alright yeah, alright yeah, alright yeah
Alright yeah, alright yeah, alright yeah, yeah

Uh, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo, yo
Things changed since we came out
Been some shit in New York
Niggaz stopped gettin' jig in New York
Bloods and Crips in New York

The Y2K celebration wasn't big in New York
Babylon live in New York
Should I keep a crib in New York or just V.I.
To handle my B.I. when with my A-Alikes
We see with three eyes

Yo Kweli, I agree I, was thinkin' the same thing myself
Smog in the city ain't no good for your health
Things changed in New York, type strange in New York
Forty Deuce don't look the same in New York

Just politics, tricks and big games in New York
Switched trains a writer can't get fame in New York
Internet and Wall Street got paid in New York
Poor folks and workin' class got slayed in New York

Even still, everyday they make weight in New York
Flashlights lookin' for a brighter day in New York
In New York, they say it's red hot
Will the temperature ease up? Black, I guess not
It's multi-lane traffic, no sign for rest stops

No corner breaks, put on your gloves and just box
No dance school to teach you to wop and bus stop
Better get up in the booth, hop up and just rock
If you think it's like that, it's not so just stop
All mankind time runnin' down on one watch, just watch

If you are just comin' in
I will say it once more so you can hear
'Cause you need to get up, right now
And move with this, yes, this means you
You, you

Yo, Mos Def and Talib Kweli bring disaster to the industry
We bestsellin' authors, writin' great chapters in history
These cats undercover like gay rappers dealin' with mystery
My platinum gray matter, spray batter that's specifically

Designed to make rappers break faster than eggshells in the mornin'
Inhaled the divine in that's laid dormant
Water from the well, stay pourin', I answer back when I hear fate callin'
Freedom fighter ready to attack at the crack of a new day dawnin'

Way more than necessary skills for the application
My flow is great like the lakes and it rocks like Appalachians
My facts more than make up for what you lack in imagination
You more confused than Tiger Woods when he made up Cabalaysian
I'm sayin'

Break bounds like the jet Concorde
Win awards before I leave for my world award tour
When they scream encore, that's when they want more
Flow steadily, whether I'm on or off shore

High potent, zone coastin', no jokin'
Safecracker sniff gon' keep the joint open
Peep the focus, high resolution, high reception
My 'Train of Thought' connectin'
With my brethren from Reflection like

You need to get up, right now
And move with this, yes, this means you, again
You need to get up, right now
And move with this, yes, this means you, we goin'

New York, Philly, Chicago, Detroit
Miami, D.C., L.A., the world
London, Amsterdam, Paris, Japan
Any place that a human bein' might stand, we goin'
