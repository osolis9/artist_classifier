Rolling-Dice:Joey Chavez
I still wear the smile you gave to me
when we were just having fun
in a day dream where we belong

now I see you never needed me
but we try hard to trick ourselves
into thinking we can be helped
and you said

come on come on just close your eyes
we'll test our fate like rolling dice

oh come on now you'll feel alive
we'll test our fate like rolling dice
like rolling dice

I still hear the laugh you gave to me
when we were just having fun in a day dream where we belong

and now we've both met someone else
and we try hard to trick ourselves into thinking we can be helped
and you said

come on come on just close your eyes
we'll test our fate like rolling dice

oh come now you'll feel alive we'll test our fate like rolling dice like rolling dice

I'll keep this fire burning brighter as long as the stars shine this isn't good bye

come on come on just close your eyes
we'll test our fate like rolling dice
like rolling dice

I'll keep this fire burning bright
I'll keep this fire burning bright
