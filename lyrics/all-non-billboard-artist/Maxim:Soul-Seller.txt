Soul-Seller:Maxim
Life is hard we all know
But like the sun we glow
Try to dictate to us how to act
We're always fighting back
So many moves we make we realise
We ain't in no disguise
We ain't in no disguise

When you sold me your soul I made sure
That you were of suitable state of mind
Now you wanna buy it back from me
You sold you, I control you
You sold you, I control you

Life is hard we all know
But do not sell your soul
Bad taste you'll leave for years to come
Reflecting setting sun
Tears will roll and pour with shame
Only yourself to blame
Only yourself to blame

When you sold me your soul I made sure
That you were of suitable state of mind
Now you wanna buy it back from me
You sold you, I control you

When you sold me your soul I made sure
That you were of suitable state of mind
Now you wanna buy it back from me
You sold you, I control you
You sold you, I control you
You sold you, I control you
You sold you, I control you
You sold you, I control you
You sold you, I control you
You sold you, I control you
