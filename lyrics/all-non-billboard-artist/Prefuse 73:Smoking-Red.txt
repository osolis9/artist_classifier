Smoking-Red:Prefuse 73
Well you, good for you

I'm not so sexual as yourself
Every day is just an extension of yesterday, a hassle
And getting out of bed in the morning is like slow suicide
Doesn't even know, it's just what's going down
Agonizingly I watch and breathe

Callers, girls, money too
It seems there's nothing I can do
