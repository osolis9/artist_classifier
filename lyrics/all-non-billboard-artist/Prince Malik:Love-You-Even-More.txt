Love-You-Even-More:Prince Malik
It's been the longest day
And I can't wait to get home to you
You take my stress away
When I hear your voice on the phone You do
And I got so much to tell you
And we got the world to see
Let's run away and live forever Today

When I walk up to the door

If that's what I gotta do

Everything to keep you happy
