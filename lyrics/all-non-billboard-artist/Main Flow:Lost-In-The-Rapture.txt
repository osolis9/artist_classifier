Lost-In-The-Rapture:Main Flow
Got captured, lost in the rapture
No doubt
You know what I'm about
Got captured, lost in the rapture
No doubt
You know what I'm about

Scale ,Mike Tyson fighting for real
I just break the leaves
Escaping with ease
Making this journey faithfully
I'm modestly vain
Hanging out 'til late nights
We're headed to school soon
Staring out the window
The clouds are covering the full moon
The streets are vivid like the lyrics I write down
The engineer in sound are checking the sound to tell me
How the mic sounds
Shooting like eastWook
Fist full of dollars
I'm heading to the post office
I probably lost 3 stacks
He just came home from doing 10
You think your story is over
But it's ready to begin

Got captured, lost in the rapture
No doubt
You know what I'm about
Got captured, lost in the rapture
No doubt
You know what I'm about

You already know how we do it
