Tired:Everlast
Make you go, soul for soul over mic control
Kid you can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his jewels
He was out to cold mock me and play you for fools

Kid, you know the rules must be smokin' super cools
Try to dis' me on the low got to be a psycho
That's alright though you know you won't see me shakin'
I'm out to blow the spot on who's real and who's fakin'

Who's givin'? Who's takin'? Who's livin'? Who's starvin'?
Diss me on the mic it's time for headstone carvin'
And every tap writin' will strike ya like lightin'
Dissolve ya like powder so turn it up louder

Go on pump the wattage get the cheese by cottage
I like mean streaks, I like Spanish freaks
I like Korean barbecue, I'm like old school beats

'Cause I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin'
And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin'
And all the wack attitudes people coppin'
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin'

I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin'
And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin'
And all the wack attitudes people coppin'
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin'

It go bang bang boogie, I'm sick like a loogie
I'm wiser than bud, I'm thicker than blood
I'm older than time molded from the divine
How can you be so bold to think that you'll take mine?

I'm cash like Johnny it's the highway man
And I'm walkin' this line the best way I can
With my farmer's tan and my bloodshot eyes
I ain't bodied no one, I ain't chopped no pies

With the butters from the gutters
I'm about to explode and blow the spot for folk nave
Up the Gun Hill Road like artillery shells
Been from heaven to hell
And I'm a say a little prayer for every rapper that fell

'Cause I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin'
And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin'
And all the wack attitudes people coppin'
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin'

Yo, I'm sick of all the shit that's droppin'
And I'm tired of all the lip that's poppin'
And all the wack attitudes people coppin'
I'm only tryin' to get a few heads boppin'
