Too-Blind:Rolo
I left a thousand roses right on your doorstep,
but you just don't see them no mo'.
Spent endless hours thinking about you,
but I guess you just don't care no mo'.

And everywhere, everywhere I go
I see pictures of you and me.
Laughing and crying, and fighting just to reconcile.
I had all you need in life.

But all through the cold winter nights,
you were there by my side.
I didn't realize, what you had inside.
All through the cold winter nights,
you were there by my side.
I guess I was too blind
to see the world inside your eyes...
the world inside your eyes.

Sometimes, when you have it all,
you may forget to be grateful.
I'm sorry that I took for granted
the most precious thing a man could
ever find in his life.

Had the whole world in my hands,
oh, how could I just let it fall?
I wish that I could turn back time,
to the point when you were mine,
so I could make it right.

But all through the cold winter nights,
you were there by my side.
I didn't realize, what you had inside.
All through the cold winter nights,
you were there by my side.
I guess I was too blind
to see the world inside your eyes...
the world inside your eyes.

Now I don't even know,
what it was I kept trying to find.
Should have just put you on a throne,
and gave you everything you wanted,
made you my own queen.

All through the cold winter nights,
you were there by my side.
I should have realized, what you had inside.
All through the cold winter nights,
you were there by my side.
I guess I was too blind.
