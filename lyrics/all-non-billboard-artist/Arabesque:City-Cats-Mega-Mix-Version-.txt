City-Cats-Mega-Mix-Version-:Arabesque
We are the city cats
We came along to see you, Tom
Hey, where are you
Come on
The other cats have told us
You're so beautiful and strong
Hey, where are you
Come on
We'd like to know
If this is really so
We didn't only come to say hallo

We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't try to hide
'Cause we can see by night
We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't strike a light
'Cause we are dynamite
(We are dynamite)
(We are dynamite)

You're hiding in the darkness
Tom, you seem to be afraid
Hey, where are you
Come on
We'll hunt you down
We're starting now
Because it's getting late

Hey, where are you
Come on
If you're this man
This famous lover man
Tonight you'll have to prove it, if you can

We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't try to hide
'Cause we can see by night
We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't strike a light
'Cause we are dynamite
(We are dynamite)
(We are dynamite)

We promise we will love you only
We'll share you love, you won't be lonely
Where are you Tom, we are exploding
Don't you see, we are three...

We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't try to hide
'Cause we can see by night
We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't strike a light
'Cause we are dynamite
(We are dynamite)
(We are dynamite)

We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't try to hide
'Cause we can see by night
We're the city cats
City cats, city cats, city cats
Don't strike a light
'Cause we are dynamite
