Somebody's waiting for me at home
Somebody's waiting for me at home
I should've known
I should've known

And somebody's got a car outside
Somebody's got a car outside
Let's take a ride
Let's take a ride

Somebody's waiting for me at home
Somebody's waiting for me at home
I should've known
I should've known
Ah wake up

And somebody's got a car outside
Somebody's got a car outside
Let's take a ride

And I know that it's late, but I don't wanna go
Somebody's waiting for me at home
I should've told
I should've told

'cause you can run and have your fun
But don't come around when she gets home
Wait, don't go and run on out


There's a door in the hall and it's open tonight
Come on in 'cause I got you tonight
I should've chose
I should've chose
'Cause you can run and have your fun
But don't come around when she gets home
