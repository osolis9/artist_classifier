Fix-Of-Mine:Diamond 
I don't know, I don't know anyone 
But she said she's not like that anymore 
So I'll see you around 
'Cause that's how the story goes, I know 
And you think you'll never be alone 
Uh oh, she's lost control 
And I just fell harder 

You and I, just another fix of mine 
Just to find anything to feel alive 

I don't know who you are anymore 
But this feeling that I'm feeling won't let me move on
