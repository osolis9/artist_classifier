I Need Your E.t.a
It's been a day since you've been gone
It seems already like a whole year long
And I've been waiting just to hear your call
Are you near, are you coming before night time falls
I'm so anxious I await your return
Just a call from you would ease my concern
Minutes seem like hours when I'm alone
I hope you're near, I hope it's you each time I pick up the phone

CHORUS:
I need your E.T.A
Doesn't matter if it's night or day
Just promise me you won't be long
I'm waiting here I'm all alone
Tell me what time you're coming home

I've tried everything to keep me calm
But what I want is to be in your arms
You're so tender girl you're never cruel
And you'd never never ever treat me like a fool

CHORUS

When will you give me your time of arrival
I can't go on like this anymore
I know you still want me
Yes I'm sure
I know you still love me
And I know you're coming home to me
I know that's where you wanna be

CHORUS
