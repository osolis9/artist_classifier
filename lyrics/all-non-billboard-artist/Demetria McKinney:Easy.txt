Easy:Demetria McKinney
Every man want some
Even some of these females
Let me give you details
These red bottoms turn heads when i walk through
Best come correct or I aint for you

I took my time on this makeup
I worked real hard for this paper
So I know my worth
Boy you got to put me first

I aint no stuck up chick
I aint picky, I just want what's best for me
I can't let nobody get the best of me
Part-time love is my destiny

No, I aint no stuck up chick
I aint picky
I just want what's best for me
I can't let nobody get the best of me
Unless they want the best for me

Baby, You and I
We can be together we can ride or die
It just ain't that easy
That easy

Wanna be my number one
We can be together we can fall in love
It just ain't that easy
That easy

Nowadays it's so hard to find real love
If you find somebody true you better keep'em
Hold on tight, dont let go
Especially if they special

It aint about how you flex, or always about the sex
If you can keep it a hunnid then you can keep my respect
I'll cool for ya, clean for ya, anytbung ya need for ya
Buttoned -down starched neat for ya

I ain't no stuck up chick
I ain't picky
I just want what's best for me
I can't let nobody get the best of me
Part-time love ain't my destiny

Oh I ain't no stuck up chick
I ain't picky
I just want what's best for me
I can't let nobody get the best of me Unless they want the best for me

Baby You and I
we can be together together
we can ride or die
It just ain't that easy
That easy

Want to be my number one
We can be together
we can fall in love
it just ain't that easy
It ain't that easy (it ain't, it ain't)

Light up your cigar
set it off in the car
It's amoving violation sirens and alarm
Struck me like a guitar
did I take it too far
Just want to show the type of things that I do for the boy

I am stuck up chick
I ain't picky
I just want what's best for me
I can't let nobody get the best of me part-time love ain't my destiny

Oh I ain't no stuck up chick
I ain't picky
I just want what's best for me
I can't let nobody get the best of me
Part-time love ain't my destiny
Baby You and I
We can be together we can ride or die
It just ain't that easy
(It ain't, it ain't)
Wanna be my number one
We can be together
We can fall in love
It just ain't that easy
It ain't, it ain't
It just ain't. It ain't, it ain't
