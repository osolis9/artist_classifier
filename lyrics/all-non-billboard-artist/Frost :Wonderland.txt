Wonderland:Frost 
Hero, touching down -- refugee from the ground
Say, "Hello" -- dance along to the light and the sound

Hero, stealing hope from the words in your mouth
But fear grows -- never far from the pain and the doubt

Lo-fi
Are we lo-fi?
Lo-fi
Are we lo-fi?

Feeling the lifeforce of another town
Better settle down ["in a day"?]
Doing the wrong thing is the best advice
Better get a life

Here in the electric light
It's a wonderful feeling to be alive

Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)
Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)
Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)
Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)

Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)
Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)
Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)
Take the heat (it's alright, it's alright)
