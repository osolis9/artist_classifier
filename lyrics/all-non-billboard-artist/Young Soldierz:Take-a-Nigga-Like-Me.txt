Take-a-Nigga-Like-Me:Young Soldierz
Uh ha, what? Young Soldierz in this motherfucker
And Wiz, is it bout time? Yeah, alright
It's on, nineteen ninety fuck
Chorus: Now everybody wanna pack a Glockwhen all the time niggas know, that'cha skins get locked
It takes a nigga like me, cos I can see thru the fake
You niggas make it sound good, but you niggas is cupcakes
Ass out if you're the last (nigga)to feel the wrath when I blast (nigga)Figure I can make a motions for murder
Mass destruction, discussions unheard of
Fuck the script, I feel the pow's in and out of town
And now it's on-a, just from city, to 300See it's a shame on how these lames keepin up the game
Fuckin up the game for the next real nigga
Until my Gz do it, time to stay cell block
Stay strong while Gz get your ride on
I been there and done that, no tellinif I ever come back but if I do, I ain't scared of it
See some niggas call drug busts, non-plussed
Swear to God, only momma had it sewed up
So fuck the company cos ya best ta keep on walkinwhile you can, 'fore my Doggs start barkin, man
Hangin out late night, off the shee-ba
All's we heard is they got what they de-served
See up in trojans, spit the game a little more than that
Then I be fuckin off the game before the next nigga
Never test what you can't keep
Cos if I need it, I'ma get it, if I want it, I'ma take it
I'm undisputed, undefeated, might've even cheated
I'm highly weeded, so much you get'cha ass heated
I know it might sound like a nigga sayin somethin
But me and my niggas ain't give nothin, yeah
For one magical wavin his Tek
I can make the whole motherfucker party and jet
Young stretch him in the house, waitin for you to
