Whatever:Gnarls Barkley
I don't have any friends at all
'Cause I have nothing in common with y'all
So who's gonna catch me if I fall?
My backs always against the wall

I don't have anything to say
I want everything to go my way
Shut up mom, it is not okay
I'm alone almost everyday

But it's cool
(It's cool)
It could be better
(Could be better)
I don't care
(I don't care)
Whatever
(Whatever)
Hold up my man

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Whatever
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Whatever
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Whatever
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
What

Told my counselor 'bout how I feel
Everyone agrees I could use some help
I love my girl more than I love myself
She’s going steady with someone else

I don’t know what else to do
Said fuck me, well, fuck you too
I know it sounds real sad but true
Being alone is nothing new

But it’s cool
(It’s cool)
It could be better
(Could be better)
I don’t care
(I don’t care)
Whatever
(Whatever)
Whatever bitch

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Whatever)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Whatever)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Whatever)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
