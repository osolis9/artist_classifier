Stop Talkin' About Me
Talk about me, talk about me, talk about me, talk (Mmm)
(Talk) Talk about me, talk about me (Ooh), talk about me, talk (Yeah)
Talk about me, talk about me (Mmm), talk about me, talk (Mmm)
(Talk) Talk about me, talk about me (Mmm), talk about me, talk

Every time I turn around
I'm always hearin' somebody tryin' to put me down
They try to say that I'm this, that I'm that
But all the while they talkin', they don't know me like that

It's a crying shame what some people do
They always say stuff about you that ain't even true
So if you think you got somethin' you wanna say
Why don't you build the nerve to come say it to my face

And talkin' 'bout me (Talkin' 'bout me) behind my back
(Oh)
If you got somethin' to say, why you say it like that
Stop talkin' 'bout me (Talkin' 'bout me) behind my back (Yeah)
If you got somethin' to say (Ooh), won't you just say that

Stop talkin' 'bout me (Ooh) behind my back (Mmm)
If you got somethin' to say, why you say it like that (Say it like that)
Stop talkin' 'bout me (Yeah) behind my back (Mmm)
If you got somethin' to say, won't you just say, just say

You better watch who you call your friends
Think I'm around, well, you can pay your caps and a few ends
Kinda funny when your dough gets gone
They talk about you like a dog to their friends on the phone

It's a crying shame what some people say
Sometimes I think that they wanna just take my place
So while you talkin' 'bout somebody else
You need to take the time and straighten yourself

And stop talkin' 'bout me (Me) behind my back (Oh)
If you got somethin' to say, why you say it like that (Why you say it like that)
Stop talkin' 'bout me (Oh) behind my back (Mmm)
If you got somethin' to say, won't you just say that (Say it to me)

Stop talkin' 'bout me (Oh) behind my back (Yeah)
If you got somethin' to say, why you say it like that
(Say it like that)
Stop talkin' 'bout me (Mmm) behind my back (Mmm)
If you got somethin' to say, won't you just say, just say

Talk about me, talk about me, talk about me, talk
(Talk) Talk about me, talk about me, talk about me, talk
Talk about me, talk about me, talk about me, talk
(Talk) Talk about me, talk about me, talk about me, talk

Every time I turn around you (Talk about me)
Every time I come around you (Talk about me)
Every time I put it down (Talk about me)
Every time I look around you talk (Stop talkin' 'bout me)

Stop talkin' 'bout me behind my back
If you got somethin' to say, why you say it like that

Stop talkin' 'bout me behind my back (I'm tired of you talkin' about me)
If you got somethin' to say, why you say it like that
(I don't wanna hear you talk about me)
Stop talkin' 'bout me behind my back (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you got somethin' to say, won't you just say that
(Every time I turn around you talk)

Stop talkin' 'bout me behind my back (Every time I come around you talk)
If you got somethin' to say, why you say it like that
(Every time I put it down)
