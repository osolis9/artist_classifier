Cut-em-Off:Dizzee Rascal
Uh
I socialise and review the situation (negotiate)
I socialise and review the situation (negotiate)
I socialise and review the situation (negotiate)
Then cut em' off
Review the situation take part take over(Socialise and negotiate, I cut
'em off, I cut 'em off)
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over(Socialise and negotiate, I cut
'em off, I cut 'em off)
Review the situation take part take over

My name is Raskit listen to my flow
I socialise in hackney and bow
I wear my trousers ridiculously low
I love females, money and creps
I'm kind of street wise I think that you should know
You're not a bad boy you're puttin on a show
You're talkin 'bout creepin up on Rusko
So keep creep crawlin coz I'm talkin bigger steps
My name is Raskit listen to my slang
I socialise with the crew and the gang
Roll utes on the street is where I hang
I'll make you collapse leave gaps in your face
You're in your neighbourhood thinkin that you're nang (oh please)
Got your people thinkin that I'm dang (oh please)
But if you try it I'll make a Rachett bang (oh no)
You can never outplay me I'm a ace
I'm not a smoker but I blaze a lot
Sit around puffin waste my days a lot
Although I shouldn't waste time coz I ain't got a lot
I'm just lazy
I'm not a rachett but I bang a lot
Got a couple beanies that I slam a lot
I'll make 'em happy with my fingers and my hand a lot (finger!)
I'm just crazy

(Chorus)
Socialise and negotiate
I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off
Socialise and negotiate
I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over

There you go again talkin like a div (shit)
Like a can't find out where you live (man it's easy)
Take off your latch I dont even need a ratch
My butterfly leave you lookin like a sieve
Met bad boys from every postcode (uh)
You could never talk to me about road
Stop dreamin' im your worst nightmare
Im freddy Krueger make the luger explode
There you go again talkin' like a star
Like I cant find out where you are
Kick off your door I ain't got a 4.4
I'll have to settle for a long metal bar (and)
I've met bad boys from every ruff ends
You could never talk to me about skengz (click click)
Talk tuff but you aint sayin much
I'll chop you up and share you out between your friends
Now some love me some do the opposite
If you feel to move to me please get on with it
Don't know why you feel the need to talk to birds
But talk is dangerous be careful with your words
But remember this I am you
So if you think your real do what you gotta do
On a level your just challengin yourself
If your feelin brave go ahead and hurt yourself

(Chorus)
Socialise and negotiate
I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off
Socialise and negotiate
I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over

We cut 'em off, cut 'em off
Review the situation take part and take over
Nothin else
We cut 'em off, we cut 'em off, we cut 'em off, we cut 'em off
Look, review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over
Review the situation take part take over
Come
