Reverie:Reverie
I live in reverie in the back of my mind
A world of fantasy on the fringes of the time My castle in the air that only i can see
A monument so rare in my deep reverie

The door is open wide it's a path to my soul
I like to run and hide from the rain and the cold I always want to be the planter of the seed
The keeper of the key to my castle so sweet

I'LL TAKE YOU THERE TOMORROW
FAR FROM REALITY
NO ROOM FOR GRIEF OR SORROW
DOWN IN MY DEEP REVERIE

I feel the running sand a i'm dreaming away
I take it in my hand As the night turns to day My castle in the air
That only i can see
A monument so rare in my deep reverie

I'LL TAKE YOU THERE TOMORROW
FAR FROM REALITY
NO ROOM FOR GRIEF OR SORROW
DOWN IN MY DEEP REVERIE
