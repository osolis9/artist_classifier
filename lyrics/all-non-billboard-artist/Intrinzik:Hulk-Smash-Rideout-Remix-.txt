Hulk Smash

Gladiator on a battle break
You better off french kissing with a rattlesnake
Chuck Taylors can of monster and some mean denim
Kick the shit out of a villain spitting green venom
I fill my brain with ammunition til I go to bed
Wake up as a weapon fully automatic loaded head
Welcome to armageddon
I'll stomp your fucking head in
Wake up naked in a ditch hot confused and sweating
I'll beat the crap out the abominable snowman
I'll stick a sword through your abdominal like Conan
I'm a crazy artist call me Van Gogh
Son I'll bring the anarchy like I'm from Sam Cro
Misguided angel I'm the leader of the BAX WAR
To both my neighbours I'm that freak that lives next door
Everything I spit is cataclysmic I'm an atom bomb
My tongues a cattle prod blow your shit to Babylon
Carnage in my catalog animal in analog
Battle god iron dialogue I'm a firing squad
I'm a subhuman species with a vicious growl
Stick a knife into your gut turn it disembowel

Hulk Smash

I'll hulk smash 'em
Yeah I'm old fashioned
My fans say my tracks are golden cult classics
Here's another one to get your fucking' skull crackin
I got you trippin' like I'm slippin you a dose of acid
Those patterns you see are my throat spasms
Favorite things to do are yoga and insult chatolics
Long hair and beard my poems are moses tablets
On a mission to burn a hole in the whole atlas
Bruce Banner stress makes me a loose cannon
Brain rage and IQ setting new standards
Fist bump me you'll end up with a new address
Purple shorts bare feet I am too savage
What doesn't kill me makes my cells proliferate
My life regenerates basically we different mate
Adrenal glands and that green fluorescent protein
You better off not even tryna get to know me

Hulk Smash

Grey skin joe fixit so prolific
We don't wish it we go get it
Ya whole clique is featherweight since seven eight I demonstrate
Mutant strength uppercut will make you levitate
Real shifty I'm still drifting like Bill Bixby
Get killed swiftly if ya attitude ain't chill with me
That's real risky like sippin on undistilled whiskey
It'll get you tipsy but still knock you on ya dick quickly
I radiate gamma rays that turn my body green
You'd have to be an alcoholic billionare to body me
Collateral damage to your establishments and property
Your only assurance would be your insurance policy
I am indesctructible never would I instruct you endeavor
To beat your chest in my presence cuz I am tougher than leather
You doc samson's are clever
But I will crush a pretender
Than beat you black blue and ugly like huxtible sweater

Hulk Smash
