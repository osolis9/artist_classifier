Who-s-the-Boss:Antoinette
Intro:

Day time
Night time
Any time's the right time
Who's the boss ofcourse antoinette's rhyme...

Verse one:

Now here we go hug your stereo
It might pump or jump around
Bum rush the sound beat it down run it in the ground
The bigger they are the harder they fall oh well they fell
Their records couldn't sell even if you gave 'em away free
Ah, honey you're just a wanna be
Rap star
And now you're trying o front on me
But kids who play will suffer when the beat is on
And the going gets tougher when the heat is on
I go off and i be keeping it kept on/make like a rash break out or get stepped on
Step child you're just a son in this
And antoinette is like running this
Yeah dance go ahead do that
Instead pick up your head 'cause i flew that
Antoinette taking no loss wearing no shorts but telling you who's the boss...

Verse two:

If you were brave because you escaped or get hit wit'
You little nit wit
You better get wit' antoinette on set 'cause i'm fed up
I'm going head up/now get up
Ducks who get stuck in
Grab your cup and i'ma fill it to the brim
So take a sip don't bite
Your lip don't take bites out or it's gonna be m.c.'s lights out
The young the old the bold they all like be looking because i'm hooking but i ain't a hooker
So save that for t.j.
That he say and she say ain't no threat
I'm knocking out gangs with no stress
So who's the boss? it ain't a weak chick
So let me launch a rhyme and let the beat kick...

Verse three:

Lace up so you could face up and hit the line up
Play me wrong and yes you might wind up dead on arrival
Because this is survival of the fittest
So do your push ups and get wit' it
Before i go off without that
No question about that ('they're closing in')yo-i doubt that
Face to face rhyme for rhyme
Fist to fist sweet dreams when rings hit lips so
Slow down i won't go down in a throw down
Yup she's out now that's another hoe down
You should be knowing this
You can't flow with this
The best the gangstress-the def soloist/i roll, the mic transforms like a decep
A's in effect so who could possibly efect the chick with soul?
The boss who has to master
To ducks who front i make like a ghetto and blast ya'
I'm hyper riper doper stronger
Break beats get broken and rhymes last longer
I'll find and lose ya' and left ya' lost
And you sweat to death like a horse/now who's the boss...?
