Spirit-of-Love:Paradise
You think i'm crazy but i can't understand
The way you love me it's not perfect way
You drive me crazy

You think in black when i was thinking white
You say love me but i know it's a lie
Don't try to hide it

Crazy for each other
You think i never find out
Always trying to shoot me down
Shotgun of love

You call me baby but i know it's a trap
I know you're kidding i'm not the only one
Don't try you pretty
Lady

Crazy for each other
You think i never find out
Always trying to shoot me down
Shotgun of love

(solo)

Crazy for each other
You think i never find out
Always trying to shoot me down
Shotgun of love
