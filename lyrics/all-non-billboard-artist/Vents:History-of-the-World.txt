History-of-the-World:Vents
Round and round, round we go!
Around and around and around and around
History of the world!

Since the day I was born, I could work for a boss or hand in a form
Or shoplift to survive 'til the cops swarm
Selling my days, selling my ability to work for a wage
Doing whatever pays
Getting so much much less than what I make and what it costs
So I guess I got robbed for the lot
The man drives the bus and makes your shirt
Gets nothing but debt for doing all of the work
Getting jerked taking his calls, licking his balls
Cause his dad owns the phone and the fucking four walls
Making things to sell, not things I need
And if you're sick then you'd better get the money or bleed
If you can't pay the bills - getting repossessed
And the Bank takes the house, you can keep the rest
It's politics and crime, world war in demand
So, everything's going to plan, History of the world!

They could rob us all blind, but when I take it back it's crime
So I take what I need cause what's theirs is mine
It's like, white supremacy, male supremacy
Kill the bullshit, know your enemy
Every right I've got has been won by working man
Not the parliament
It's been done before - getting done again
I don't want no part of what they're offering
Kevin Rudd ain't a friend of mine so if you wanting me to rock the vote
I'd rather cut my throat
Rather drop the soap than cop The Age
The history of the world, from the slave to the wage
Is a class war, sorta like Vinnie Jones slamming your head in a car door
Darker than Darfur
Everything that you ask for, a little matter of genocide
Step aside - a history of the world!

Spending more time with the ones I hate than the ones I love
Iron fist in a velvet glove, held above
With boredom and anger but I pay for the medicine
Everyday reproducing the hell I'm in
Life of the citizen is the life of the militant
High school, death of the innocent
My desires is unfulfilled
My dreams are repressed and replaced with a pill
Or a bottle of red, but the boss is a good bloke (ha)
Gives me break for a bite and a smoke
And the shit I make -he takes more- I gotta Wonder
How the motherfucker gets away outnumbered
But, they got police to beat me up, prisons to lock me up
Military wants me up
To kill folks that are just like me far away
For the freedom to keep getting fucked everyday. (in the world)
