Lady-Heroin:Sam Sneed
Now when I first met her, I was down in the dumps
'Cause my punks would funk
Some cowed on some chunk like Willy Lumb Lumb
Feelin' sad and mad hurt

That's when this fly honey walked up to me in a brown leather skirt
She sat on my lap, she said, "I heard that you rap"
She said, "I have some prime-time skill that you need to tap"
I never met a girl, so I front with it

So I took it to crib, sparked a blunt with it
Hit it, it was the bomb
([Unverified] on cloud 69)
But all of a sudden she start flippin' and scrip talkin'

Like what have you done for me lately
Like she hate me, I wasn't no romance without the ends
She had me drivin' and stealin' and illin', just to hit the skins
I was open you could drive a bus up my nose
My friends tell me I shouldn't mess with these type of hoes

Lady Heroin, you know you diss all that, yo it's the bomb baby
You got me hooked like crack, got me dealin' over back
'Cause it's the tap that cap, I used to be like a mack
Now I don't know how to act

The pussy was the bomb, had a nigger on sprung
I was shootin' up
That's that shit in my bloodstream

The pussy was the bomb, had a nigger on sprung
I was shootin' up
That's that shit in my bloodstream

Even dough I'm a fiend, I can't break clean
'Cause everything so sure me when she's on the scene
And can't nobody tell me bout my boo, I wore a tattoo
Track marks on my arm, black and blue

But she didn't feel the same for me
She had a jealous boyfriend by the name of O.D.
Now O.D. was short for Over Dose and whenever he got caught
Niggas pushin' on his girl

He made her comatose, Lady heroin had me thinkin'
I could get toe to toe with O.D. but he showed me
Damn my nigga told me
(Told you what?)

Not to mess around, when I had to clown
And now it did me a six foot ditch in the ground
So take it from me, yo the Negro with a tab on his toe
I'm tellin' ya not get with that ho

The most scariest female
Once you're under her spell
She crosses your buck sells
And send you on a highway to hell

Lady Heroin, you know you diss all that, yo it's the bomb baby
You got me hooked like crack, got me dealin' over back
'Cause it's the tap that cap, I used to be like a mack
Now I don't know how to act

I'm off in your bloodstream, snatching your cream
Can't get enough to me you's fiend to the extreme
A nightmare but not a dream realer than real
State once I penetrate you mind state

Ya never get ya scrilla straight
I'm on a mission to invade your soul
Open up your brains and let me take control
I would be under when I had a love like this

Made you steal and kill for me baby with just one kiss
I could sentence you to die in the blink of an eye
Of a needle I think you evil on the sly, my supply
Non-stop, skin pop until you drop

Blood watch drippin' out your snot box
I got your brain locked hash lady in the hot spot
Black widow stick my tooth in 'em
And check 'em with that China White venom
Than I mo' fill 'em swimmin' in that bloodstream
Gotcha now you a fiend from lady heroin

Lady Heroin, you know you diss all that, yo it's the bomb baby
You got me hooked like crack, got me dealin' over back
'Cause it's the tap that cap, I used to be like a mack
Now I don't know how to act
