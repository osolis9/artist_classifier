Priceless:Snap
.so would you sell your life? would you sell your soul?
have you sold your thoughts to greed control?
do you have the mind to break away?
a slave to the man, your life is chained.
what are you going to do do? well you've bought your image and you lost your soul.
and where are you going go? when you're all alone with empty goals.
behind these walls and facades you hide.
we see you smile when you cry inside.
you cry for life a valued life that one can't buy.
success is money? your life's based on a lie.
you...can't...sell...you can't sell me.
so can you find your life since you've sold your soul?
have you lost your heart to greed's control?
do you bow down and kiss the ground?
to your possesions your life is bound
