Pour-One:NBA YoungBoy
Remember smoking weed with yo lil brother
Matter fact n---a I use to call you my big brother
Then you did some foul s--t and s-x with my sister
Then threw it in my face in front the people on insta
I ain't gone speak on that disease that y'all gave to each other
I take my lick and keep trucking
Forever I keep it gutta

So much love for my brother even though I ain't give him nothing
All the s--t he did for me I know he feeling like f--k me
Remember my first time getting shot at, got a gun and start clutching
Billy and Ray we was thugging
All that night stealing sumthing
You introduced me to them boys and i ain't like them for nothing
For some reason I'm still happy that Big B had stuck
Missing Deno, man I really looked at dude like a brother

Saw him in jail and ion't know why but I had asked him to discover
This for Brianna, never thought that we would change on each other
My loyalty right here with Fat, but you still know that I love you
Three3 remember you and Ben was the ones that was stunting
I use to ain't have no money, asked Monique I was bumming
Ben told me "Mane you alway f-----g asking for something"
Grandma had just died and nobody ain't want give me nothing
Stole your weed got on my grind I was tryna make me something

I kept smoking all my pack, I couldn't hustle for nothing
Some s--t had came missing out your
pack and you had put the blame on me
Hurt me deep, you don't never suppose to question your brother
After all you did for me you think that I'll steal from you?
I had to distance myself, back through that North I was running
I went to juvenile was looking at myself like a flunkie

Through a windown I couldn't see out all I heard was some thunder
On the phone with Lashonda, she told me ashtray was dead on the corner
Started saying to myself I gotta get out this jungle
When them n----s killed my cousin mane that s--t made me wonder
I keep a burner I refuse to let them boys put me up under

Come pour up with a real n---a
Light one up for them real n----s
I know Boozilla still with me
Yeah, I know Lil' Dave still with me
I know my grandma still with me,
while I'm chasing after this mill ticket
I know my grandma still with me,
while I'm chasing after this mill ticket

I hop out get the busting before I let myself die
Staring down the barrel like looking in your eye
Take one mine I'll make sure that we all cry
Take one of mine I swear that we gon' all cry
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
If I'm (?) we don't spare none, spare none
Dive in that water with no vest on
Only thing I got is my (?) on
Watch out I bet I stretch some
Watch out I bet I stretch some
See me in that Benz, hop out that Benz and they hating
You can run up on me and gon' catch one to the face
(?) saw me and he went the other way
I'm like what? what? we can do it anyday
And they hating
(?) saw me and he went the other way
Like what? what? we can do it anyday
