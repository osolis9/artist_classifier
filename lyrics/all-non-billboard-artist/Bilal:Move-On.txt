Move-On:Bilal
We had a love, the kind
I thought would last forever
I thought you would leave me never
But I was wrong, she went away
And took my heart with her

Oh, I gotta move on now that you're gone
Pack my bags, pack my clothes together
This is what I'm gonna do
(This is what I'm gonna do)
This is what I'm gonna do

I've been lookin' but cannot find
Searchin' but cannot see

I've gotto move on
Now that you're gone
I've gotto move on
(Be strong, gotta move on)
Now that you're gone

Damn, B
Looks like she got you goin' crazy

I heard a song
That used to belong to you and me
Now that song makes me cry so freely
'Cause I can't stop the thought of you
Leavin' me, babe

I used to love you but now
I gotto give that love to someone else
I used to be so enchanted by your presence but now
I'm all alone, so what can I say?

I have been lookin' but cannot find
Searchin' we cannot see

I've gotto move on
Now that you're gone
I've gotto move on
(Be strong, gotta move on)
Now that you're gone

Move on
Move on
Move on
