One-and-the-Same:Everlast
One and the same, one and the same

I wish I could see beyond the filthy blue horizon
See what lies ahead of me
Perhaps I'd see the path of my own destruction
And avoid my destiny, she said
"Heaven and hell is one and the same boy"

She told me, "Heaven and hell, boy, was one and the same"
We all meet somewhere in the middle
She told me, "Heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same"
I said, "It can't be true"

I wish I could touch you in some totally new fashion
Who are you girl, I'm a man
Now I can't guarantee your complete satisfaction
So I'm gonna do you the very best way I can

She said, "Heaven and hell is one and the same, boy"
She told me, "Heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same"
We all meet somewhere in the middle
She told me, "Heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same"
I said, "It can't be true"

Wish I could find some time to stop and smell the roses
My landlord won't let me be
My head is full of paranoia and neuroses
Tryin' to consume my identity

She said, "Heaven and hell is one and the same, boy"
She told me, "Heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same"
We all meet somewhere in the middle, yes we do
She told me, "Heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same"
I said, "It can't be true, it just can't be true"
