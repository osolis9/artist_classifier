U-Can-t-Fuck-Wit-It:Akrobatik
Challenge my verbal gymnastics

Yo my style, it be up in that ass like verbal sodomy
I gave you a lobotomy and punk you still callin me
So now your crew is takin losses I'm larger than Colossus
And all y'all niggaz know just who the boss is
It's Akrobatik on a mission
Turnin your day time dreams to nocturnal emissions
(Hit a bomb these tracks the raps of zombie ax ?)
It bring the boom guaranteed to fill the room
With tunes to make you swoon
My extra flavor lasts an extra long time
When I rip the stage with an extra strong rhyme
Now, my rep grows like the nose of Pinocchio
Just because I mastered the art of braggadocio
Bumpin off the next men like X-Men
Even my notebook scared it ran away with my next pen
I'm leavin rappers in the dirt like fools gold
Out of control to rule your soul is my goal now
You can't fuck with the style
And Akrobatik's runnin through these tracks like a four minute mile
You can't fuck with the style
And every time I touch the microphone I'm prone to get buck wild
You can't fuck with the style
I'm runnin with the wolves in the town like predators of the wild
You can't fuck with the style
Maxin with these queens +Livin Single+ just like Overton and Kyle

Yo, I got a battle hymn for all your asses
While you flowin like molasses I be revokin niggas ghetto passes
I got a million flames to burn at chya
His style I don't need it I'm even movin quadriplegics like they furniture
While heads get sprayed like antihistamine
I disinfect this rap shit like Listerine
And mop ya cool like Mr. Clean
Yo, claimin that ya kill something
While you at McDonalds with a mop waitin for me to spill something
How you whip a battle fresh flippin cattle flesh
I make your life full of stress come test
The word on the street is that rap's gonna die
The way some niggaz rhyme it ain't no need to wonder why
Yo you think you comin with battle raps
While my style's tighter than crooked cop's handcuffs and fuckin saddle straps
First rappers get gassed and then they jell up
I take you out the frame and have your picture be developed
Yo, I'm makin rappers have conniptions
And start some crack habits call me Akrobatik 'cause I flip shit
Yo, and if your rap style broke, nigga fix it
I can't believe your word if how you live it contradicts it
You can't fuck with the style
I got my shit lock down like (my kazzow?), c'mon now
You can't fuck with the style
And every time I touch the microphone I'm prone to get buck wild
You can't fuck with the style
I'm runnin with the wolves in the town like predators of the wild
Yo, you can't fuck with the style
So call me Lance Ito cause I'm puttin niggaz on trial
