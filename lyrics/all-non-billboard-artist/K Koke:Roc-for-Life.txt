Roc-for-Life:K Koke
From a life of set backs to a jet pack,
I spent my life in them flats tryna extract,
I spent nights in the trap tryna get stacks,
And like the boy dapps no regrets fam,
My reflection in the mirror is my perception of a winner,
my redemption to begin a resurrection of the sinner
I'm walking through the corridor, troubled thoughts,
I'm married to my problems and she won't divorce,
I'm talking to my conscience like I want it more and I can't ignore the fact that I'm in running form,
But I can't afford to slack or be comfortable
To be the best on every track is what I run it for,
If I believe that I can then I must for sure
And make something out of nothing being bloody poor
I'm unstoppable, and on top of all
I done made it through the rain and the thunderstorms
I've been training for this day since I learned to walk
And I should pick myself up ...
I'm breaking out
I'm running
I'd win the fight
Got me running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life
Aim for the skies
Wanna make you mine
So running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life
Concrete, throws me only consciously
But most of ‘em just talking we'll be bouncing on your …
This is all C, MMC lota Cs
Black billionaires, neither one my nigga got the greeds
Mister caught up or Mister Robinson know my position
Probably cause this for …
I can pick up the parties
And I went to college my partners was fiscal problems
Dropped out and now I'm getting dollars like at God damn Harvard
And it tells you I will make it, now forever powerful
But you niggas couldn't play the foe, or the five
Yeah, roc boys still running side
I'm breaking out
I'm running
I'd win the fight
Got me running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life
Aim for the skies
Wanna make you mine
So running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life
