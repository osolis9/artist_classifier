Yagga-Yaw-Yaw-feat-Saukrates-:Redlife
Open sesame i let down the main gate
Four years from now i'm just too long to wait
I laid up in the cut like a microphone master
Blame all of it on nature we some natural disasters
Reoccurrin' every tenth leap year
We bring quality over touch ya sincere
I'm not citytv but my music bring much to the air
Word 'em up heard 'em up
I get high without a parachute
Them grass roots
When you see us you better shoot
All of that gold, plat go to the better group
Pimp shit like an old cat in a leather suit
Get realer then based on a true story
Tequila and margarita got a nigga horny
A brother from the ghetto a pity from the city
(that cut is up played for a bill fifty?)
Flow got blow like a sack
No time to relax what it is remy big payback
Check it out what, what
Thought we weren't gonna make the album this year
Think again nigga for real

Ay yo these redlife cats they don't stop lay the law
How the hell you gonna act when for sure they're raw
(so take that now)
Yagga yaw yaw

Yagga yaw yaw
We black employed we don't stop lay the law
How the how hell you gonna act when for sure we raw
(so take that now)
Yagga yaw yaw
(and hold that now)
Yagga yaw yaw

Ay yo we still buckin'
Rex still slack talkin'
Trust me b you's a dead man walkin'
And it could happen in a new york minute
What the fuck he started it
Don't let the gat finish it
Ain't nothin' sweet
Still put the bully in beef
Take them rookies of streets
Hold tight to the blow like it's my last heartbeat
So what the fuck you thought
I came with rex there so who the fuck you brought
Yo you soft son plus i ain't feelin' y'all neither
(walk or box bro) easy don't rush the procedure
'cause when i spit out
You got three seconds to get out
Leave your mom ballin' now why the i fuck let my kid out

Is you lolly gaggin' son
Stash the heat in the bag and run
There's much more of that to come
When we're droppin' cats the fourth
Leapin' you like frog
That's odd
It seems the tail always wag the dog
Control the patrol do you even own your soul
No 'cause i got 'em all on parole
Besides bein' shitty you're old
So you out with it
Make way for the new who's properly outfitted
You claim that your clock did it
Imparticular this ain't really you son
You could lose one
When it's extra-curricular activity
Readily never lyrical hollow heads to sever
Every last joint
And when you're jointless you're pointless
So i ask again what's the point
When you seein' me your joint cracks
With hot wax
Packin' it up in plain black worldwide first
I let you hear it on the way back
These straight cats
Kickin' you plain facts
Yo behave
We all modern day slaves
I be one to rhythm
On my dick drip regulate this hip-hop jizm
Exorcism slice through you with me words of wisdom
Faggot the evidence was gone when you kissed 'em
Reasons why the rap sells we rap well
Reasons why you're itchin' and dubbin' i'm pro maxell
Reasons why i ball (ballin' this pimp strips blackwell?)
Reasons why you hate the pussy a man never tells
Crack heads like sledgehammer would crack eggs
What choice do you have besides livin' life red
