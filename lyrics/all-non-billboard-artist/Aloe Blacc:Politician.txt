Politician:Aloe Blacc
Making promises, you can't keep
Hungry wolves, dressed like sheep
They shake our hands, slap our backs
I don't know why, they do us like that

Now what i'm saying, is things ain't right
These conditions, ain't no good for life
Who's decision is it anyway, yours or mine

Pushing poison, to our children
Still promoting, class division
We are starving, but you grow fat
I don't know why, they do us like that

Now what i'm saying, is things ain't right

These conditions, ain't no good for life
Who's decision is it anyway, yours or mine

One day, we're gonna open up
And do what we got to do, yeah
But the revolution will not be televised
And we put the script on you

This free country, is not so free
Ain't no hope, for you and me
From the power hungry, money fiends
Putting the world, behind the scene

Now what I'm saying, is things ain't right
These conditions, ain't no good for life
Who's decision is it anyway, yours or mine
