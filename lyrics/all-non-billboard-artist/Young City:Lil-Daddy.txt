Lil-Daddy:Young City
That boy, I see ya lil' daddy, Young City
That grill, I see ya lil' daddy, we here now, Bad Boy South
That truck, I see ya lil' daddy, as we proceed
As we proceed to give you what you need
Them grillz, I see ya lil' daddy, you ready? Let's go

Shawty jea, now, I'm here, so mean wit ya fatty
I'm a pimp, that's how I live, I see ya lil' daddy

I know you see me stuntin', big bodies is all I want now
My mouth's 'bout a hundred, some say that I'm the shit now
I done came a long way from the get down
Hustlin', jus re-upped but I gained nothin'

Shit done changed when the lil' muthafucka
Nigga started makin' hits now
Girlies that neva used to talk to me, talk to me
'Cause I got it made and the kids look up to me

I'm escaladin' on them thangs 'cause I'm Young City
Pimp pretty things and they go fo' a buck fifty
No, now you can see me in the drop-top
Oh ma, that boy from the hot block

Wit me is my semi, neva stay empty
'Cause I gotta keep it on cock, cock
Just in case you try to ball the block
No way 'cause I call the shots

Show me nigga, tell me not anything
You spend, you flip, you get, you trip, I got
From the yacht to the g-4, to the g-5, this is stock
Back to the platinum chains and my watch

You can see the purple ring when I spot
I talk it 'cause I live it, on a mission to double up
My wrist on a count of dup 'cause it's comin' up
Get ready fo' it bubbles up, yup 'cause I'm

That boy, I see ya lil' daddy

I'm a Bad Boy millionaire
Look at how I spin my hair
So fresh, so clean from my head to my feet
I don't think y'all heard me clear

I done walked for that cheesecake, now I got cheesecake, oh yea
Lil' boy you don't really wanna go there
Don't hurt yaself tryin' to keep up 'cause I do it all year
Look at the price of my Jag, look at the name in my tag

Visa's from my momma seater's they be poppin' them tags
G's up scrubs down, man it feel good to get love now
And I'm up next to best, how ya lovin' that?
'Cause it's really 'bout to go down, your next kid

No picture on the mound won't strike me
I don't give a fuck who don't like me
Get y'all muthafuckas know who I be
Keep it up and get put on I.V.

And I ain't got love, it's good reason
Why I'm rich as fuck but sho 'nuf
Same good reason to make 'em go nuts
When I pull out the aqua green truck

With the diamond in the back, 26 shinin'
What mo can I say? I'm ballin' and I'm on fire
I'm that nigga that ya want, I'm that nigga that ya need
I'm here like I neva left, I'm soon to be the fuckin' king, see I'm

Ah, I'm so in love wit myself 'cause I made it and I didn't need no help
Regulated to the basement
I'ma be from a ten speed, Bad Boy South
I'm so blessed, Young City

I got credit cards, I got checks
'Bout a hundred broads, keep 'em unda check
I'ma really make it hard for you to process
Make way for tha boy 'cause I got next, I see you lil' daddy

I got this in a chokehold, don't fuck around wit me 'cause I'm loco
Got franks in the bank, that's why they wanna bank
Out wit me but I rock solo
Dolo from state to state, why do these haters hate?

Is it 'cause I'm eatin' wit and I backin' them easy cakes?
Any time of the day I be low-key, untamed nigga you can't hold me
Got fame to my name, put change to ya brain
Neva step into the path of a O.G.

Right arm is a king-cut bracelet
Left arm is a new presidential Rolie
'Cause I'm in a brand new situation
Fuck payback, y'all muthafuckas owe me

Everything I got I deserve, got the record say I'm hot, I'm superb
Not artificial, real to the bone, wrist'll arm nigga, nigga get hot in here
Seen what are you bootin' up, don't make me pollute ya up
Wit my young shawties and they shootin' up 'cause I'm
