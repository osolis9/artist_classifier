Tomorrow-s-Never-Promised:Lil' Eddie
Oh boy yeah
I won't go from a nightmare
When it felt so real
I'm just so happy baby you're still here
I wanna hold you one day
Never let you go, never let you go
'cause I don't wanna lose you again

Pre-Chorus:
Let's do a whole lot of nothing, ohh
Clothes the blogs get back to lovin
Disappear from plannin' yeah
Fall back enough for .. again

Chorus:
Just wanna stand with you,
'cause tomorrows never promised
If you found lost you and make it to be honest
If you're all I got, 'cause any day the glocks could stop
Tomorrows never promised.

Honestly, I may have took you for granted
Baby, but enough for sure now it's nobody else
I rather spend the rest of my life with
And I put that on y life yeah.

Pre-Chorus:
Let's do a whole lot of nothing, ohh
Clothes the blogs get back to lovin
Disappear from plannin' yeah
Fall back enough for .. again

Chorus:
Just wanna stand with you,
'cause tomorrows never promised
If you found lost you and make it to be honest
Give you all I got, 'cause any day the glocks could stop
Tomorrows never promised.
Tomorrows never promised
Tomorrows never promised
Nooo, noo

[Chorus:]
Tomorrows never promised
Tomorrows never promised

Oh oh oh oh yeah
Never promised
Tomorrows never promised

I won't go from a nightmare
When it felt so real
Tomorrows never promised
