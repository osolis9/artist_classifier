Call-Me-The-God:Fred the Godson
[Verse 1:]
Ayo I make believe, speak convincing
Past you fuck a fiction, Miles says you got to make me leave
These words I'm tryna make em see
I can feel it in my fingers like I'm breaking weed
I'm in the Bentley, check my archives, say it
And who did? Got a hard drive, nigga save it
Get it? Hard drive, save it
But what ya'll jerkin off? Fuck who you came with
I live this shit, this ain't a movie tho
I'm who they go to when they wanna hear some shit
Now this the difference,
I got a crib and a studio, your crib is a studio
We got different ranks
My re-up is a key up
You don't like the way I handle the rap? Nigga D up
Cleared out, isolation
Acapela this last line for observation

[Hook:]
I got drugs for your brain
Trap house what I rap bout like I'm tying up your friends
Like I'm supplyin you with caine
Got the rap world sayin well snap,
Just call me the God
Just call me the God
Just call me the God
Just call me the God
I got bars for you nigga

[Verse 2:]
My flow would make her laugh, I'm comical with it
I get pussy behind these bars, conjugal visits
Get em off me
I'll give all your crews a fix, never cross me
Damn did it, we could split a verse for those
If not tryna pay me, stop it baby like birth control
All day I've been copped in
A fish scale in the crib, weighin my options
By the morning's gonna fly
When it touched down, niggas gon pump it til it's dry
And my soul they gon buy
But my hard count got the feds jumpin off sides
I get you on hit
I got the bull's-eyes on a shirt like she workin for target practice
Cleared out, isolation
Acapela this last bar for observation

[Hook:]
I got drugs for your brain
Trap house what I rap bout like I'm tying up your friends
Like I'm supplyin you with caine
Got the rap world sayin well snap,
Just call me the God
Just call me the God
Just call me the God
Just call me the God
I got bars for you nigga
