[Planet Asia]
Pegz what up!
You all know who it is man
Yeah, it's Planet Asia medallios

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
Titanium tanks, potrown shots
Iranian shanks, platinum plates
Ate to the face off grapes
Eat off cake
Digging in the crate, spitting in your face
Shitting on your tape, fit this on my waste - let's motivate
See me in a soldier state, hardcore, hard body shit
Flow that's obviously the most worthy to politicing
If this was college I'd be riding on a full scholarship
Nigga's acknowledge this, I'm more hotter than hollow tips
Forever on some rival shit, bitches swallow dick
From herb rats to model chicks, crack babies to cosmic kids
I start writing once I feel the buzz
And if you was high as me then you'd know how real this was

[Hook] {First part by Pegz, second part by Planet Asia and vice-versa}
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Diligent Music!
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Gold Chain Music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Diligent Music!
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like

[Verse 2: Vents]
Vents in the pects, it better be loud
I rhyme mentally foul
Facts is hard to swallow like Pedigree Powell
You mad but everytime I'm in it
You get a feeling I'm a blood and my style compressed to three minutes
Or you can feel it like a kick in the nuts
Or losing your loved one, the lumps up in the guts
So ya, selling the drugs right up in your house
Come home, me took the television set and the couch
My flows have got a definent bounce, to get your head banging like satiricon
Vegabons sing along
Mat-o-fact bring it on
We could get it on like Lebanon 'til we both dead and gone
Put the record on blast and let yourself free
Cos tomorrow keeps swelling in the past
There ain't nothing like diligent music
Your favourite record bro, guess who produced it

[Hook]
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Diligent Music!
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Gold Chain Music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Diligent Music!
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Gold Chain Music

[Verse 3: Pegz]
From the streets of Adelaide to St. Kilda Puram
Loved by mothers, respected by villinous gangs
Feared by bigotted cats and ignorant trash
Like leaders of a right-wing political branch
We resonate through inidiginous camps to the bedrooms of working-class
Kids from the flats
Without the layered effects or filtering facts
We're all children of the same lost immigrants fam
Don't let the media deliver the plan
Subliminal brain waves got you swinging a flag
Six o'clock got you feeling with angst
Ten-thirty's like "sweet dreams honey", who killed the romance?
Pegz and Planet Asia fill the expanse
Chemically saturate your compillary glan
Bringing it back, lyrically fulfilling the fans
Like hip hop's number one diligent man, it goes

[Hook]
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Gold Chain Music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Diligent Music!
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Gold Chain Music
It ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like, it ain't nothing like
Diligent Music!
