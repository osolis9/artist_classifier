The-Rut:Delta
Come on down to the rut
Come on down to the rut
where people sip boredom outta bottomless cup
and life is twice as ruff when you come back for more even though you've had enough,
yeah come on down to the rut
where people get stuck sippin' boredom outta bottomless cup
and life is twice as ruff when you come back for more even though you've had enough

two days from now tomorrow will be yesterday
And many will remain in the same place anyway
Hell plus heaven
El plus seven
Self plus bevan
Melvan blending
The one lust n lackin fuss bust back spring
Just begun like jimmy cuts sacks in
Just imagine your trust companion must abandon your true love with a mad man
This underhanded life takes more then one aspirin
Stars die n become hasbeens
Function fashion
Punks in plastic
One giantic rut we must relax in
Dilapidated planning for military cannons
