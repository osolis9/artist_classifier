 Opa-Locka goons. I'm hanging out in Chevy Cool. Real fun to walk through, but we don't hang around the groups. Smoking in the hood. I got that work out in Bunche Park. Respected everywhere.

 Smoking on that asshole. Rip rily. Cash flow. Niggas know that Brisco be stunting all you assholes.

 On 22nd Avenue. Bring some action from the bag. Always packed my tools in case some gun fight go down and I ain't gonna lose.

 From Shakers to Homestyle. From Hometyle to Bitch City. Two minutes from Cash City. Super yellow bitches take you back to the block with me. I'm a block nigga so you know the block niggas feel me.
