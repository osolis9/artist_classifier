Parts-Unknown:Viro the Virus
The congregation can please,
open your books to the chapter of V
420, and the lesson reads

Haters wanna make me meet the grame reaper
But am Jersey Jesus I rise like Easter
Change holy water to wine propose a toast
Then change the wine to Bahamian coke (yo)
I gat more than 12 disciples
Shout out to them, tryn to reap the way tha I do
But they see its harder than it looks
When am burning Kush thats a burning bush
(Get it) Virgins n Groupe n Love
I bring them home 2 by 2 n make the couchie flood
But keep my guard up coz one broad I ain't even touched bulbed up n said the son was my blood
(What?) I said give me back my rib
You ain't Billy Jean n the boy is not my kid
Hiphop is dead n passionless

I sacrifice my life to make it live like Lazarus

Can I get a witness (let me see your arms raised)
Can I get a witness (with nobody to be praised)
Can I get a witness (let me sing for change)
Can I get a witness (so thats the reason I came)
Can I get a witness (you see me doing my thing)
Can I get a witness (somthin misses u when u game?

Can I get a witness (you wouldn't know that I let it burn)
Just don't take my name in vain

All praise Viro
Blessed be the flow
Broke the DaVinci code in just a minute or so
When I preach people be running to listen
I can feed a village with one bucket of chicken (Amen)
No need to walk on water
Hit your ride with one of my loyal supporters
(i see) Coz though I've been persecuted
There's still true believers who heard the truth in my music(word)
And this is how they reward it (how?)
This is the greatest story ever recorded (oh)
I showed rappers the way but they ignored
Now its judgment day n they're facing the lord (V)
Gabriel is playing his horn

Am swinging my sword n my crown is made of stone
Don't crash with me brother
Or whatever you ate prior to that will end up your last supper sucker

Don't try it
I'll leave you laying in the line then dying I am a giant like Goliath
Or OC Yumanora only towards so dope be can't get through the border
I show up when dope music is ordered
With a corder n drove through Sodom n Gomorrah
The lord of Lords raw n pure I swear am the answer to your prayers
Don't try it
I'll leave you laying in the line then dying I am a giant like Goliath
Or Michael Strenghen, New Jerusalem to Bethlehem am the man
Only know one way, only grind all the time you know I won't even rest on Sunday
The day am king the doing the demn thing I swear I am the answer to your prayers
