Mic-Check-instrumental-:Aceyalone
If it wasn't for a mic check i wouldn't have a check at all
- a one two, a check a one two
if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
- a check two, a mic a check two
if it wasn't for a mic check i wouldn't have a check at all
- a one two, a check a one two
if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
- a one two, and i'm a check you
I start most of my raps off kinda slow
just so you could see exactly where it gonna go
i make sure your body's strapped in
cause i'ma tailspin and you're liable to get thrown
the bible is the microphone; i read from the scripture
leave it up to you to see the pictures
i hover above mc's like a flying saucer
with the sorcery to alter the future
present and the past, don't be hesitant to ask
me to be the man i'll be the last
i'll be movin fast on that ass, i stipulate your fate
i take a grip i'll take a shot i'll break your plates
now can you take the weight or do i have to make it lighter tighter
than you could imagine that i had to been when i recite a rhyme
i might as well be inside of your mind
i know you thinkin, "damn! how does he? what was he a man
or a machine with computerized diagrams?"
i tell em, "nope! i am of the flesh, fresh, dope"
i'm set apart you're just a shot in the dark
and the darkness casts no shadow
and i'll be victorious, no matter who i battle
so every rapper in the house shut the fuck up!
Cause if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
- check one, check two
if it wasn't for a mic check i wouldn't have a check at all
- check a one two check a one two
if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
- a check one check two now i check you
Now everyone knows i got the milk like d, homemade quilt
to get your wig peelt, like it should be
top o' the mornin to ya, it's so many ways to do ya
i offer you the shield, just before i deal on ya
i recommend, that when i squeeze the puss from your skin
you pretend it ain't happenin
cause everywhere is my stompin grounds
when mc's stepped in i stomp em down to the lowest
you the slowest rapper that i met, but you owe us all a favor
not to, jet (nah you ain't goin nowhere)
not until you show us you be flippin
i give your body lashes and whippins
t crashes the board like pippen, i has to be trippin
not for your pleasure or your entertainment i came with
a crew called self, and everybody looked just like me
and we agreed that we dope fool
we got flavor and everyone knows who's the saviour
cause everyone knows, everyone knows
everyone knows i got flow
And if it wasn't for a mic check i wouldn't have a check at all
- a one two, a check a one two
if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
- a check two, a mic a check two
if it wasn't for a mic check i wouldn't have a check at all
- a one two, a check a one two
if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
- a one two, and i'ma check you
*alternate last verse*
Yeah, peep this out, peep this out, peep this out...
this here's real life, right
and we are fully animated, highly intelligent, original life forms
landin' in your leavin' (living) room
now back up from the tell-lie-vision i need breathin' room
we'll be leavin' soon on a runaway brain train
so sustain and seckle
cuz wild game can't be tamed or tackled or shackled when i echo this mic check
you know that
can't hold back the blowed back when i flow that
ooh, blew his wig back for tryin' to ride pig (piggy) back
now dig that
i done slid back
used my view finder
i'mma give you a reminder
i'm on the straight and narrow with no blinders
no blinders
but i still see the rhyme designers that bite like sidewinders
with ten toes down and i spin flows 'round and 'round
on an angle, with anger, the angular warlock-like strangler
sociopathic, graphic
psycho symptom: drastic
plastic coated, bloated
fatty tissue acid
i'm jurassic i unmask it with a bread basket full of mold and yeast
the stench is a clencher when the gases are released
so inhale
cuz you know you know you inhale
as it is in heaven
this is to my sistren and my brethren and it goes
If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all
now check one check two
check one check two
check one check two
