Someone-Else-s-Arms:Ma$e
Two days and I've not slept a wink with these thoughts that I've been thinking. This is
the mark I aim to miss (again). You toss and turn, I lie awake. Who knows what I've been
drinking. Another cheap, meaningless kiss (to give).

 From the beginning, dulled down and lost with all it's charm. I just want to wake up,
wake up in someone's... I just want to wake up. I just want to wake 
up. I just want to wake up. I just want to wake up.

 Six days and I can see the same brown eyes in this reflection. Is this man you say I'll
be (become)? You toss and turn, I lie awake. Into the sand we're sinking. Holding us back 
from breathing free (I'm done).

 From the beginning, dulled down and lost with all it's charm. I just want to wake up,
wake up in someone's... I just want to wake up. I just want to wake up. I just want to wake
up. I just want to wake up. i just want to wake up. I just want to wake up. I just want to 
wake up. I just want to wake up. I just want to wake up.

 More than words, you keep to yourself. Like a curse that fares thee well. One man
came. One truth to tell. All this blame. Hammers your way to hell.

 I've got a feeling It's not the safest place to start. This heavy breathing, it seems we're 
better off breaking hearts. From the beginning, dulled down and lost with all it's charm. I
just want to wake up, wake up in someone's... I just want to wake up (I just want to wake
up). I justwant to wake up. I justwant to wake up (I just want to wake up). I justw ant to 
wake up. I just want to wake up (I just want to wake up). I just want to wake up. I just want
to wake up (I just want to wake up). I just want to wake up.

 I just want to wake up in someone else's arms
