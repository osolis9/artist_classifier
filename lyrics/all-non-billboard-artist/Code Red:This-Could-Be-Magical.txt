This Could Be Magical
(ratajczak/watts/missen/rodell/graham)

Lee:
There've been so many times
I misread all the signs
I gave my all and left my heart on the line
But now you're here
And what's really goin' on
Is not quite clear
You're all i need to get by, oh yeah
I've waited all my life to find someone like you
And now i'm guessing that you feel it too

Chorus:
This could be magical
This could be for real
Or am i just another kiss and tell?
Tell me the truth girl, what do you feel?
Cos what i'm feelin' ain't no nothin at all
This could be magical

Roger:
Beautiful
You're the one i want in my life
I know it's you i adore
But how you feel i'm not sure
Oh girl will you do me right?
Now can i make you see that
You and i were meant to be
You are my destiny

Repeat chorus

Neil:
I've only one confession
I'll love you more than life
And we could be so special all through our lives

Repeat chorus
