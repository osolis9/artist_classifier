Everybody know i don't go out that much
But when i go out i hear so much stuff
About dope, about this, about that
About egypt-e, about rap-a-lot and my contract
All in my life, jocking what i do
I got my knife, my clock ain't that few
I got my 9, my .38 and my beringer
I'm ready to go to war with lyrics and i'm daring you
You step to dope with a rhyme
Any line, any kind, you little punks, i don't mind
Because i'm mentally gifted
Now watch me shift it and uplift it
Can i kick it with a swift kick?
Like a pander but i'm a panther, a hunter
A grand slam home run hitter not a bunner
Been hurt too many times to trust you so i go for the gusto
Don't even attempt to stop my flow
Cause my lyrics bust your game in half
You wanna battle? go get your royalty check and put up half
You jocking on me, leeching on me, looking for a piggy bag
I'm locing up cause there ain't gonna be none of that...

Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight, two shots...
Dead weight...

A brotha gotta pack his peace
I see, just to get self peace bullets gotta release
And no, i wasn't raised like that but you gotta survive
In south park your life is on lease
Watch your back, how many times have i said it?
And books and magazines don't lie, i know you read it
It will happen so fast, it will happen so quick
Brothas looking for a strong come-up, a major lick
I'm in it to win it
I'm telling you i'm in this rap game to end
But how can i save more money
And all that money i need to spend
I hooked up with egypt and we make terror beats
Then i'm flat broke searching for money
In between our concerts
Barely making it and still it's allah's thang
I have just enough to put 94 cents in my gas tank
See, everything be cool when
I'm producing your souvenir song free
Now you wanna pull out your gun and fight
When landmine's charging a fee
Hmmm, i see how you are, a conman, self centered solo star
You jocking on me, leeching on me, looking for a piggy bag
I'm locing up cause there ain't gonna be none of that...

Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight, two shots...
Dead weight...

K.o. my friend indeed, point blank, triple-x, street military, grimm and the latin sectors

Allah, yeah...

Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
Dead weight, when i'm releasing dead weight
Two shots to the back of your head is all it's gonna take...
