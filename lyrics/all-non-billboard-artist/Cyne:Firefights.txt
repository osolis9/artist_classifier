Firefights:Cyne
Vapor trail sky writer, so livid live wire
Illuminate the dark, I spark a new fire
Moving slower than exams with colder hands
Just a burning man in the desert raising sand
Final curtain call, take the stage then we fall
Floyd turning Pink right before he hit the Wall
I'm just a pessimist masquerading as a law
Murphy heard me hurting but still wishing the worst upon
Higher intelligence never meant benevolent
Give me what you got and I'll decide if you're relevant
Put a bird on it, call it art, I fall apart
Straight to the heart muscle, I tussle to get the part

'Cize like firefights
Marble to the wood grains
Stainless steel shine rhymes
Power to the hood lames x2
Oil to the grease beats
Contemplated cocaine
Sick, sad world bought society some Roll Aids x2

Rise and shine moment, culture crime coated
Juicy in the middle so sick I spit on it
Then going in it to the sweet defeat finish
But putting on protection, don't want to see clinics
This is 'Cize Starr Aurelius
The subject and the predicate
Alias to aliens, corruption in the data set
Auditory alimony, pay it out and keep it hot
Use it for the matrimony, turn it up until we part
Super duper digital, hi-fi to lyrical
So fucking pivotal change your heart biblical
Gimme the paper I will solve it so analytical
And break it to the constituent points then I get at you
Crazy and dangerous, butter knives to idiots
'President not American', shit's so ridiculous x2

I am the scratch and the itch
The pimp and the bitch
The welt and the switch
The missile and the blimp
The cold sore
Hanging off the cute girl's lip
The hole in the ship
Aderal and the fit
The bird and the bee
The flower and the weed
The savings account after the overdraft fee
The sweat on the hand extended to make plans
The boy and the Man
The star and the fan
Me
