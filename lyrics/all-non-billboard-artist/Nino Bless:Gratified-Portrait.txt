Gratified-Portrait:Nino Bless
(feat. Cambatta & Ness Lee)

[Verse 1: Nino Bless]
What what, we on now
Shortcomings swarming, trying to dodge my own shots
I'm throwing, so who's winning if I'm dropped?
Life's not all pie, its like poor Wi-Fi
Sometimes you gotta be at the right spot (I think I found mine)
My stock never better, now that ya'll competitors been warned
Each metaphor encompasses my effort in a song
The nexus, between failure, success, wrongs, rights, the results
(Now you know what I'm made of Brooklyn)
The grind of Dame next to Jay, that helped build Roc-a-Fella for em
The heart of Bob Marley, getting shot, then going out there to perform
See I weathered storms and locked horns, with gods
On beats I'm what Loaded Lux does in the Acapella form
Or forum, whatever, its settled
I don't fuck with you folks, keep ya medals
I'll be the ghetto's Huffington Post, you see this mettle?
This ain't no Logan weapon X shit, can't melt this
It's that mettle that molds your will and zest when pressure sets in
This restlessness is filled with intense emotions
Like when John Bonham's death caused Led Zeppelin's split
Bless is an index for kids with no guide through adolescence
So I add a lesson for every session missed, check this
No texting; look you can read this, so be it
But it's better to hear the tone that I speak in, you might need this
My momma said I need Jesus
She found out I sold drugs, weeped, then tried to kill herself, and almost succeeded
Her second lease on life's been spent in constant shame
Like I dishonored her name, think she's even proud of what I became? No
This feels like prison, I'm trying to maintain
Behind these bars I'm locked in this pain, I stopped with the praying
I have not been the same since the day my sister was raped
Swear on my soul, if I find who did it, I'll empty a clip at his face
There's tears in my eyes now, I've dug too far
Scratch what I wrote for these last two bars, I had to let it out

[Hook: Ness Lee]
It's nothing in this world fair, and if you think life's fair
Then you've seen life rare
Cause when you think it's right, there then it's gone
But that's my team right there, and if you think I care
What you think contrare, cause we
We on, we on, we on

[Verse 2: Cambatta]
Momma said that daddy had a love problem
Daddy said that momma had a drug problem
Momma said daddy left he ain't coming back
Daddy said, I don't know what daddy said, daddy's dead
Momma said make him pay for every tear you had to shed
Lawyer said daddy was on drugs so no back up bread
Batta said if ain't this rap then its gat to head
Nino said you the best rapper not from my daddy's eggs
Nino's right, right? But I'm still cooking Vigo rice
Still couldn't sleep at night, still losing demon fights
Swayze gripping steel, black neighbors hate 'em cause he's white
They don't see that he is Christ
For my white brother, black brothers gonna bleed tonight
Reverse of the freedom plight
It's hurts me to see the price, the cost of this evil vice
That's forced to these people's lives; the envy, the greed, the pride
That's programmed so deep inside, like four centuries of lies
I want a job, I'm gonna need a tie
Say my name is Steven Wise, and change my voice from deep to high
I go to court and I don't even try
Unless the jury is blind or judge is on reefer high
Or black Jesus descends from the freaking sky
Maybe then they'll be an even pie
Death is just a concept, a threshold I haven't went beyond yet
Honestly it's a non threat
I fear nothing, but not even nothing cause that's something
Put a hole in a nut for the dough and eat munchkins
The killer of my dad said he wouldn't drop
The killer of my dad was a fucking....

[Verse 3: Ness Lee]
I wanna leave this evil reef we're on with even odds
Completely honest, we have all had dreams of being large
You'd be in awe at all the steam I've lost to see them launched
I've had several second attempts
I've learned lessons; stepped on a limb
This is Ness' web redemption, yet there's no peter tosh
And if we're being raw
I mean my God you see the opportunities we've not?
You're probably thinking they're somewhere in between winning an espy on ESPN and espionage
And my faith in humanity is lost, deceitful broads key your car
And not to see it start, the streets is hard cause you can't even walk
Without keeping a heater on,
He will rob you if he thinks you got it
It will tee him off, and it won't be in golf
Some nigga creeping even caught me in dodge
I made a wrong turn, I should have had my blinkers on and seen it all
He aimed at me and stalled, I saw the reaper's call as I recall
I asked him why me? he said "it's in my genes," well then you need them washed
You little rappers think its sweet, you're off
You can get Skinny Black'd over your CD in stalls
Try to get yourself on, plug in the wrong outlet
To touch green still your error won't be free of charge
I swear I get better with time, dog
That's why I have no issues in ever telling you my flaws
These niggas can't stop me stupid, its useless
I stop myself its probably more entertaining for you to watch me do it
I gotta do it for I, like as in my way
But in my case, it has been I that's been in my way
So if I may
I will revert back to the guy that made Nino first believe in me
It's Phantome to the E-N-D
