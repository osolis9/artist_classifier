Absence:Stalley
Correct
They like "Stall, where you been at?
You been quiet, you been gone for a many night"
This summer comin' and we need that fire music
You know that intelligent trunk shit that be boomin'
We need them jams so we can ride and tuck the roof in
That feel good joy ride with a cute friend
Soft skin, brown skin, passenger seat companion
I capture the scene so well like it was shot by John Mangan
Dream deliverer, you can call me the Sandman
I complete the summer, give the streets something to bump to
Fly by and invent so fast it'll feel like someone bumped ya
System on loud, ears about to rupture

They like "Stall, where you been at?
(They like "Stall, Stall, s-s-Stall where you been at?")
