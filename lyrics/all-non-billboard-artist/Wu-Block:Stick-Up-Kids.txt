Stick-Up-Kids:Wu-Block
Verse 1 (Sheek Louch)
Keep taking about that money
Ima stick 'em
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stick 'em
Send a bitch home wit him
Let her tell us where to get him
Got the hollows in that ruger
Im looking at your chains
Cause them diamond look clearer
Than that water in Aruba
You ain't even gotta jack 'em
You barely need a gun
You can walk up and smack 'em
Then you got the rats
That fact should be up north
Donnie on his bullshit
Lay him down on the floor
My other homie downstairs
ain't even gotta koll em
I'm just coming for that raw
My daughter said stick 'em
My son said daddy if he move
My grandmother go to church
To pray on my victims she say
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em
Ya know I'mma slim nigga
The burner get passed
Around the crew like a grammy
My little man with autusim
And looked at duke and said stick 'em
Why ya looking at me stick 'em
I hope you remove the body
But where we gonna ship 'em
Fuck it I just draw a door to me duck
He said ship me, I'm not giving it up
Word! Awe shit!
Its gonna be a long day
Her maid just got enough
Maps for this hallway
Home still smelling like ajax
Ripped the Jules off his neck
Understand it came through
Doc had to staple his face
This how we do it in Staten
We only get caught with out hoodies off
Let alone the ratchet
My daughter said stick 'em
My son said daddy if he move
My grandmother go to church
To pray on my victims she say
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em
Get my hand on the hawk I'mma stick 'em
Aids needle I'mma stick 'em
Got the red nose off the leash
Can't wait to stick 'em
Usually make 'em take it off
Slow when I strip 'em
Prolly better to kill 'em
Cause he can't take the whipping
ARA is the armed robbers academy
I don’t care its waever homes
Big shit, all the way
Down to the heron bones
Credit cards, debit cards
Wedding bands,
Camouflage, earth tones
Yea my cloth is cut different
It don’t cost nothing
But if not I'mma burrr stick 'em
My daughter said stick 'em
My son said daddy if he move
My grandmother go to church
To pray on my victims she say
Burr stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em
