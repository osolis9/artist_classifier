Suga Suga"(feat. Frankie J
So tight, so fly
You got me lifted, you got me lifted

[Frankie J.]
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it’s the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?

[Baby Beesh]
You know its leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Gurl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns
You was there when the money was gone
You’ll be there when the money comes
Off top I cain’t lie I love to get blowed
You my lil’sugar, I’m yo little chulo
And every time we kick it it’s off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky ickey or my sweet oowy goowy (fa real though)

[Frankie J.]
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it’s the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?

[Baby Beesh]
Now I ain’t worried about a thang cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a superfly chick
That aint makin you a ?? playa
Cause doowop, she fly like the planes in the air
That’s right she’s full grown settin the wrong  tone
Im diggin the energy and im lovin the o-zone
So fly like a dove so fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood then im a natural dude
And we some natural fools blowin out by the pool
She like my sexy-coo mama with blades on her berata
Rockin Dolce’ Gubbana(sp?) with high-drows and a igwana

You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it’s the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?

Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Gurl you keep it so fly with you sweet hunnybuns
You was there when the money was gone
You’ll be there when the money comes

Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?

So high like I’m a star
Feelin so high like I’m a star
Feelin so high like I’m a star
Feelin so high like I’m a star
