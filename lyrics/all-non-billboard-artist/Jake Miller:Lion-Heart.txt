Lion-Heart:Jake Miller
I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change
I'm wild for the way you are!
And when we touch it makes me feel love in a stolen car
So I would never try to tame you, you and your lion heart
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart!
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
They will never understand you and your lion heart
Yeah, I'm the only one who can love you the way you are
So tear me up and set me free, we'll run underneath the stars
I swear that I will never leave you, you and your lion heart!
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Girl, you crazy and I love it
These other dudes, they don't cut it
They can't handle the fact you walk your own path
But me, I can't get enough of it
'Cause you're wild, but me too
So what's good, just come through
I could show you the night of your life girl
We can turn the whole world in our zoo
Yeah, so baby let me hear you roar
Come pounce on me like never before
You're the queen of the jungle, I could be the king
I am right here, you ain't got to worry about a thing
You'll never go in hungry, I'll fight for you
Nothing will frighten you, 'cause every night for you
I could be your light when the skies get dark
I love you and your lion heart!
I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change
I'm wild for the way you are!
And when we touch it makes me feel love in a stolen car
So I would never try to tame you, you and your lion heart
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
You and your lion heart!
Yeah, yeaaah
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
You and your lion heart!
I would never try to tame you.
