Walk-on-Water:Kat Dahlia
You shed ya lights, you left me blind
But I could never turn away
Whether ya black, whether ya white
You always left me in the grey
And your shadow's grew
But I never knew
Now I'm chasing blue
While you're changing hue
You bring the rain, you bring the night
I never get the time of day
I wanna cry, you wanna fight
All this lovin' goes in vain
Wish you wore my shoes
Cause I've torn them through
But what would that prove
I'm so confused

I'm not feeling too well, cause I just can't tell
If I'm entering the gates of, heaven or hell
Can I trust you, cause I just can't tell
I know you so well
Remember when we fell, remember when we fell

I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water
I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water
And I'm drowning in emotion
Your quick sands suffocating, wish I was a little taller
I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water

You shed ya lights, you left me blind
But I could never turn away
Whether ya black, whether ya white
You always left me in the grey
And your shadow's grew
But I never knew
Now I'm chasing blue
While you're changing hue
You bring the rain, you bring the night
I never get the time of day
I wanna cry, you wanna fight
All this lovin' goes in vain
Wish you wore my shoes
Cause I've torn them through
Wish you wore my shoes
Cause I've torn them through

I'm not feeling too well, cause I just can't tell
If I'm entering the gates of heaven or hell
Can I trust you, cause I just can't tell
I know you so well
Remember when we fell, remember when we fell

I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water
If I'm attracted to the ocean, just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water
And now I'm drowning in emotion
You quick sand is suffocating, I wish I was a little taller
I'm attracted to the ocean, but just because I feel it
Can I walk upon the water

It's a storm a brewing, on the horizon
No matter what I'm choosing, baby I ain't deciding
Suicide, suicide
Like you told me catch a knife. I'll trade ya promise for my life

I'm attracted to the ocean
But just because I feel it, I can't walk upon the water
I'm attracted to the ocean
But just because I feel it, I can't upon the water
And now I'm drowning in emotion
You quick sands suffocating, wish I was a little taller
I'm attracted to the ocean
But just because I feel it, I can't walk upon the water

I can't walk upon the water, no
I'm attracted to the ocean
But I slip right through, I slip right through
I drown for you
Baby I slipped right through, I slipped right through
I drown for you
I drown for you
