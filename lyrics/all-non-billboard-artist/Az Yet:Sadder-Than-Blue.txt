Sadder-Than-Blue:Az Yet
My heart has been broken 'cause of you
One always must leave, that's nothing new
I thought that you'd really like to try to stay
Stay together, let's try again

It's been seventeen months on my own
The nights are so quiet, all alone
I long to feel you in my arms again
Girl, won't you please come back home

Spendin' my nights all alone
I really, really wish you'd come home
Savin' my heartbreak for you
Makes me blue yeah, sadder than blue

Days walk past me like years
I struggle to swallow my tears
It's been a long time since I held you near
I still remember the scent of you, dear

Twenty nine hours in my day
Feel like hell every day
Hopin' I get through to you
'Cause I sure miss you
Come back, come back to me

Spendin' my nights all alone
I really, really wish you'd come home
Savin' my heartbreak for you
Makes me blue yeah, sadder than blue

I never wanted to swallow my pride
I tried to play it too cool, so cool
Girl, if we only could go back in time
I wouldn't hold back a damn thing from you

Oh, I'm spendin' my nights all alone
I really, really wish you'd come home
Savin' my heartbreak for you
Makes me blue, sadder than blue, yeah yeah
