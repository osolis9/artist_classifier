God-Bless-America-live-:Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung
ENGLISCHE ÃœBERSETZUNG!

If so, Banjo!

We might have lost nearly every war
but we're chosen to keep the order
and who doesn't drink Cola and doesn't eat Burgers is in every case a blooding fucking terrorist.

At first it was the indios turn,
we sent them to Manitu and there they chew pemmican.
No matter if Ku-Klux-Klan with a texas hat,
where ever we are there everything gets okay.

USA ao USA God bless America!
USA ao USA we're here before somebody calls us
USA ao USA God bless America!
USA ao USA we're here before somebody calls us

If so, Banjo!

In Vietnam it wasn't gentle for us
also we drove home sadly from Cuba & Korea.
But at the desert storm and in Hiroshima
there was an exploding atmosphere - Made in USA.
We are not about power and oil and money,
we just want one thing, that is the whole world.
Then we'll build a Disneyland everywhere
and sing: Mickey Mouse for President!

USA ao USA God bless America!
USA ao USA we're here before somebody calls us
USA ao USA God bless America!
USA ao USA we're here before somebody calls us

Now play it again Uncle Sam!

Banjo!

In the good old times of the new world,
there stood uncle Tom at the cotton field.
Today he's rapping us the Country-Charts to breaking
and soon he'll own Hollywood.

Because of that we take him with us to Irak
and there we play together "club out of the bag"
We help the democracy to its right
and that works best with a torturer.

USA ao USA God bless America!
USA ao USA we're here before somebody calls us
USA ao USA God bless America!
USA ao USA we're here before somebody calls us

If so, Banjo!
