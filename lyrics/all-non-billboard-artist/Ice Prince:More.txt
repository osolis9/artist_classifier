Baby you should gimme some more ai
Baby you should gimme some more
Baby you should gimme some more aii
Baby you should gimme some more
You got me saying;
Ai ai ai baby you should gimme some more,
You got me saying; ai ai ai baby you should gimme some more,

Yeah,
All the times you did me wrong
All the times you did me bad
All the times you held my hand it felt like Willow Smith and dad
All the times you shut me out see the rain was heavy on me
Every time I look in the sky
I feel like a burden a pain is on me
All the times you call me stupid like cause of my rhymes of music
See I don't get it how my lowest ponts define my music
I'm writing you in songs
And look at the kind I'm using
My liver is weak and my heart is asleep
And I tell you my mind is snoozing
I'm witty get it no more
And guess what time it's chosen
All the times you put me on hold
It felt like I was just trying to loosen
All the times you hit me and shit me
All the times you ignored me completely
All the times you had my heart cracked
Bobby and Whitney
Sometimes I sit and wonder why we make mistakes and blunder
I really wish we last long
Anaconda
I'm sweating in the winter
I'm shivering in the summer
Table for two it's dinner
Punch in your fucking number

Baby you should gimme some more ai
Baby you should gimme some more
Baby you should gimme some more aii
Baby you should gimme some more
You got me saying;
Ai ai ai baby you should gimme some more,
You got me saying; ai ai ai baby you should gimme some more,

Yeah,
I believe in you and I
I believe in love and trust
I believe that rumors fly
But I believe in we and us
See the candle light is burning
Let's make use of it now
My Mercedes rap and the ladies hop in my troopers around
Being around the universe seen girls in jeans and shirt
But I'm only asking more you
And that's what really hurts
And I promise you my love
Till I'm dead and squeezed in dirt
Imma let my spirit fly
Imma never take out this earth
I'm scared of reaching heights
To break it down is harder
And even if I write
I'd make it harry porter
I believe in us forever
I see our fatty daughter
I see us on a table waiting on our family order
It's too much bomb and hate
That kinda complicates
It's too much dropping around
And now you talking out of state
See you can keep your shit save it for another day,
I'm a be a big boy
And I don't need no under ray
My weekend working out
No need for the same old route
No need for the curse and the fire and the dirt and the pipe in the same old house
No need for the cat and a dog
Turn in to the cat and the ford
Tell it to the man and the wife and the man's wife and whatever the pappy afford
