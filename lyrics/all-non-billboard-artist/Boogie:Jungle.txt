Jungle:Boogie
Nigga this is what that jungle do
You been plottin' nigga wasn't you?
I should have never even fuck with you
Yea i started in the back; had to skip the line though
Ima keep that shit a stack til' my fuckin' time go
Niggas throw you in the shade; cause they wanna shine though
Nigga throw me in the grave; in a Ferragamo
Man i can't believe they killed my fuckin' bro Quado
Shit was so deep i had to say that with my eyes closed
That shit made me wanna treat a nigga like he John Doe
Nine on me Rondo, nigga John Doe
This is all i ever wanted nigga
Why would i let you take it from me nigga?
I ain't stupid, ain't no dummy nigga
A couple fingers on a couple triggers

Anybody want a problem tell em this is my shit
Tell em if they want a problem I'm from Highbridge
Got a nigga with a shotgun up in my whip
Making bitches go retarted with this hard dick
Why you think my name is Artist I'm an Artist
I woke up to a m√©nage, I'm just being honest
I get money, if i want it, ima cop it
If a nigga want static let him have it
Have you ever seen a mini swmi automatic?
It go dumb like a drum it'll be blastin'
When it come to that fire I'm a fuckin' dragon

I was walking in the rain with mh Timbs on
Stepping over puddle full of pain, its a big storm
13 on my Balmains, its a big storm
In the club love to make it rain

Ever since i was a young nigga
Coming up nigga
Ain't nobody show me love nigga, so its fuck niggas
