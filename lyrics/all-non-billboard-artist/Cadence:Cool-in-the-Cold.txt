Cool-in-the-Cold:Cadence
(it's cool in the cold...)

Have you noticed that everybody's being super nice?
The igloo is glowing with a special glimmer on the ice (yeahhh)
The party is heating up
Coming on and join the club
There's always room for just one more
Look around and it's obvious

Cool cool cool, out in the cold
And it's fun fun fun, covered in snow
Everyone's here it's that time of the year
Oh, ohh, ohh it's cool in the cold (ohh, ohh, ohh)
It's cool in the cold (ohh, ohh, ohh)

There's a chill dance party going down where the Puffles are
And the snowballs don't get thrown nearly half as hair (noo)
We're giving coins for change
We're rocking on the stage
And we love to play this time of year
Winter's the best because

Cool cool cool, out in the cold
And it's fun fun fun, covered in snow
Everyone's here it's that time of the year
Oh, ohh, ohh it's cool in the cold (ohh, ohh, ohh)
It's cool in the cold (ohh, ohh, ohh)

Bum bum bum bum bum cool and it's cold
Bum bum bum bum bum cool and it's cold
Bum bum bum bum bum cool and it's cold

It's cool cool cool, out in the cold
And it's fun fun, fun, covered in snow
Everyone's here it's that time of the year
Oh, ohh, ohh it's cool in the cold (ohh, ohh, ohh)
Cool cool cool, out in the cold
And it's fun fun fun, covered in snow
Everyone's here it's that time of the year
Oh, ohh, ohh it's cool in the cold
Cool in the cold
Cool in the cold
Cool in the cold
Cool in the cold
Cool in the cold
Cool in the cold
Cool in the cold
