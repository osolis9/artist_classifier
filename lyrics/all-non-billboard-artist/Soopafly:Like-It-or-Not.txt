Like-It-or-Not:Soopafly
It's been a while since I've seen you smile
Been a minute since I've been up in it but who could say the sky's the limit?
I seen a pretty bad woman, made me stop and pivot
Body, hair, face, nails lookin' so exquisite

Now what is it that a pimp who never simp'd
Can keep tip to the game, know when to jump ship
Now you can find me in the wind, blazin'
Stayin' high, Soopafly is so amazin'
I'm yo' baby, dependin' on what the goal weighs in
Pimp 'em from black, white, Puerto Rican and Asian

Now welcome back, now wave your hands if you're feelin' that
Gettin' down, smokin' a pound with the million stack
Back up, I creep up on 'em 'til they crack up
Take my time, movin' it slow and never slack up

Baby was servin' me but couldn't keep the knack up
Upset 'cause she was drinkin' all my yac up
It's like splittin' a blunt, fill you with what you want
Lovin' don't have to front, up it from once a month

To three times, a fine nigga with genuine ability to keep it comin'
Now when the bus runnin' I'll be there to get ya
I'll play like Kodak and get the picture
I'm all down for stickin' but I can't kick it wit ya
So what's poppin'? You walkin', or the boots knockin'?
Yeah, I hear you talkin' girl, but I'm only down for one option baby

We can fuck around a little, and get down a little
Roll around the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
Let me hit the spot, tell me if you like it or not

We can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little
Roll around the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
Let me hit the spot, tell me if you like it or not

I step in the club lookin' dippa dapper
Soopafly the pimp rapper, unique with heat like the gun clapper
Comin' after, cut from the root, they dumb with laughter
Quite exquisite, I'll make the ladies come and pay a visit

What is it you need baby, the weed baby
Got enough to give you the feed baby, now take heed baby
I fuck around with top-notch and top-crotch hoes with top clothes
Money hungry, now stop hoes

Just because I walk in the club don't mean I'm spendin' a dub on ya
This money's mine, think I'm actin' funny, fine
I can lay back and sip the wine
Cheese down, you can tell her for real, I'll work for mine, you can feud

What can't you find, feelin' past your prime
Lookin' for time away, given the time of day
Whoever can display the sweet smooth array
Soopafly would never pay, make 'em say, "Hey hey"

Gettin' hands to get to know me, you take a chance
Intrigued by my top league aura
Now we can fuck around for a minute or two
To get with you is like I'm feelin' it, dealin' it and later on I'm killin' it

Baby told me her shit was like ice, so let me chill on it
Hit that ass until it was blue, had her Crip walkin'
Knocked her ass out no doubt, no more shit talkin'
Who can deny that Soopafly was at your door knockin'?

Let me in, you can even invite your friend
But shit costs baby, don't get lost baby
I'm only in for the cash, it's not for you
Shit I'm only keepin' it true ynahmsayin' what the fuck I'm 'sposed to do?

We can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little
Rollin' through the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
While I'm hittin' the spot tell me if you like it or not

Or we can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little
Rollin' through the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
Til' I hit the spot, tell me if you like it or not

Now would the game be different or the same
If I surcame the temptation to pay a hoe, kickin' it to lay a hoe
Shit, what that for? Hell motherfuckin' no
Givin' money that's mine? Hell motherfuckin' no

A hoe gotta pay me to pay her let alone lay her
Just because I'm runnin' this town you picked the wrong
Mayor couldn't even get me to pitch in on her telly
Askin' for me, I brought her down like R. Kelly, I said

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Didn't know Soopafly could sing
Shinin' like these diamond rings
Who be bringin' the heat? Who dropped her off in the street?
Who rock it unique? Who pop the soft when it freak?

Whoever can be livin' in a world payed by me
Is definitely livin' a dream
Definitely you can check the meaning's which by I don't pay
Ain't no limit or tellin' what Soopafly might say

We can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little
Rollin' through the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
Let me hit the spot, tell me if you like it or not

Or we can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little
Rollin' through the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
While I'm hittin' the spot tell me if you like it or not
