Where the fuckin' money?!

(Blunt Funk entertainment. You know what I'm sayin' bitch?)

Verse 1 *(Bart of 3X Krazy)*

I hits the block walk wit a Tech
a zip in my pocket
350 rocket to get up out of the cases
move, get away cleanest if the po-po's try to beat us
for the funk won't leave you breathin'
I've been married since a fetus
3 Tia fo Lia! (3 Times for life)
The 100 blocks got it sewed
put your lips in my business and get them mutha fuckas mowed
my game is to be sold
no suckas when I roll
you comin' at me crazy juss to get yo lips swole like pop gum
givin' up lumps and bumps so I'm non-stop
when I dumpin' hot ones out the drop
pull around and get you mopped
put the Mobb against a series of haters
tied up in a knot wit instigators
start speakin' fo playas
I got my front porch sewed up
the feds chasin'
through the back roots, cuts an stretch
I got no time for no patience
Keek hittin' fences
A-G bailin' through the trees
I was keyed
so it's basic that you make it on your tee's nigga!
Uh.

Chorus *(3X Krazy)* 4x

The Thug Money
the drug money
the mud money, bet yo blood, and it's stuff under the rug money.

Verse 2 *(Ager Man of 3X Krazy)*

Smokin' some of that green dope smashin' through the East
5-0 couldn't even catch where I was in the Chevy wit hella speed
hopped up out my vehic
seen cops hidin' in the trees
slapped my mutha fuckin' Mac-10 cuz them P.D.'s they will bleed
in my back pocket is a Radio Shack C.B.
watchin' my back be lil Steve, signal me when they leave
cuz niggas ain't goin' down no mo'
for the 9-6 fuck the 4
fuck off fully both of they doe
wit nitro gas for the murda show
get to they shop, and hit the back door
some of you niggas don't really know
real killas don't need a, 4-4 to make that niggas, head blow
put bombs in his pick up
I bet ya'll niggas won't see him no mo'
cuz when that mutha fucka blow
no come back, everybody gonna go.

Verse 3 *(Keek Tha Sneek of 3X Krazy)*

For the Thug Money
they jack a nigga for nothin'
I be leavin' you dead in the alley
this kill a 5-0 Cali
for the 9-6
these woody-wood all in my mix
bust a nigga upside his head for arguin' wit a bitch
I think I'm tired of these woodies
so I gathered up a million niggas
and burned them Big Willies
Straps! I need to find some fullys
and a gang that is sure to clean your crowd
pistol let off repeated
immediatey
black and white drop ridin' through the spot
and tryin' to stop my flow, cash
so I gotta get that ass
they radioed a rigg up
so I'm on feet like ???
plus I'm a getaway
tell the crew, put my shit away
change my description
and fired up a C.F.A.
crooked cop came
I-LL-A
everythang went on thugs in the O-A fuckin' K
they, know the A
they ended D
the enemy
and these house niggas, and peckerwoods harrassin' me
so I'm harrassin' back
hot on the roof top wit my gat
Fuckin' blast it!
Splat!
Suspect he dressed in black
I
left 'em layin' flat
ghetto bird don't know where I'm at
tucked under 
and sneakin' on another fuckin' task money.

*(Chorus)* 4x

Verse 4 *(Richie Rich)*

>From the cradle to the gravin'
misbehavin'
like a fuckin' stowaway
trunk full of throw-aways
Glocks
Tech's
AP's
Mac's
fuck wit 'ol skool Richie Rich you get you ass taxed
nigga Hitler was a killer
Frank War was a mack
for all my years in the game I got so many gats
nigga 
it's for the race war
don't wanna face more
niggas than I can handle
blowin' 'em out like candles
have you ever seen a nigga work a thirty-eight
for the, drug money
to stuff under the rug money
Rich and 3 Times
niggas thought it wrong
it's Blunt Funk for the scratch
once again it's on
I hate to kill, but I will for the skrill
into my section, for the leathal injection
AK-47, hundred round gas-aholic
smokin' these clips and can't call it
Nigga!

*(Chorus)* 4x

Nigga!
