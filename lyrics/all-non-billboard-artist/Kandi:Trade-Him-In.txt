Trade-Him-In:Kandi
(*Prod. by Drumma Boy)
[** feat. Gucci Mane:]


You thought I was playin'*
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,
You thought I was playin
I told u I was so sick and tired of complaining
That's y I finally traded u in

[Verse 1:]
I treated u like royalty
But u didn't ever wanna give me the same courtesy
U treated me like a toy that u didn't need
Kept me in a box and every now and then u played with me
I tried and tried and tried to tell u how I felt
But u kept on doing your thing like u just didn't care
Sumthing bout the time I told u that I wouldn't share
But I guess u thought that I would never go nowhere no, no

[Chorus:]
Now your missin my kisses
Your missin my hugs
Your missin my juice box
Your missin my love
U took me for granted like I wasn't enough
That's y I finally traded u in that y I traded u in
If he don't act right girl(trade him in)
If he breakin u down girl(trade him in)
Treat him like a car and get a new model
Trade him in trade him in
If he got screw loose(trade him in)
If he slow u down then trade him in
All my girls let's ride and hold your head high
And trade him in trade him in

[Verse 2:]
Now u begging baby please
Cause u missin all the good love that u used to get from me
U miss how I do every single thing u like but now
I be using them tricks on somebody else tonight
Guess u ain't heard when a womens fed up
And through there's nothing in the world
That'll make her come right back to u
U never ever thought that I would make a move
How long u thought I'd sit and be played like a fool

U thought I was playin'
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
U thought I was playin'
I told u I was so sick and tired of complanin
I was waitin for u was strayin
That's y I finally traded u in that's y I traded u in

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3: ~Gucci Mane~]
She hired me then fired me
She hired me then fired me
She fired me I'm tired said
She stayed out so she lied to me
Untradeable unfadeable tell b I'm irreplaceable
Gucci cash is that's fine and dandy
Let me see u, step it up 
Never will I stress one on to the next one
Just missed a good one
Always tryna flex sumthing
Y would u leave a keeper
Trade a bentley for a reagal evidently bluntley
Speakin me and him are not an equal
50 gran one shoulder shower he make 13 bucks an hr
We make love each night for hrs
He don't beat that thing with power
Tell the truth that boys a coward
Come back I can't live without ya
He say let me get that out
Ya sorry send that boys sum flowers

If he don't act right girl (trade him in)
If he breakin u down girl (trade him in)
Treat him like a car and get a new model
Trade him in trade him in
If he got screw loose trade him in
If he slow u down trade him in all my girls
Let's ride and hold your head high and trade him in trade him in

Trade him in
Trade him in
Trade him in yeah
