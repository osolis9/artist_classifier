True-MC-s:Panjabi MC
Yeah

Sumpin' wild

Here come da sun, da crazy buddha smoker
Hoods roll down'n'turnin' out the folk-a
Got mixed vibes but the rhymes they be ringin'
I'm pumpin' out the sh... with the nozzle swingin'

Flavours they be rich like desi and water
So bust out the glitch & roll the next doodah
Right, drug got 'eavy
Back it up the road like a Chevy

7, 8, rim bring the grins from the singer,
Bouncin' all around with the crazy bass bin

I likes to check dem, rollin' around
Shakin' up the ground and cussin' em down
Like dat's da way it's cool with the fake DJs
Sellin out the dance for the radio plays

I's from the street
I eat soiled meat
I slap those dogs in the high concrete
And I got souls for the stinkin'
But the hip-hop word like, whatevah

Roll a bag o' herbs in the king-size reefer
And toke upon da sh... like Omar Sharif-a

True MC's are born to fight
Instead-a sellin' out to dance for the limelight
True MC's are born to fight
Instead-a sellin' out to dance for the limelight
Boo-uh!

Ohohohohohohohoh
Nooooooooooooooo

Times they be fresh like Kool & The Gang,
Back in the days when they used to get down
And nowadays they got men
Knockin' at my door, and cuffin' up my hand

Well they be suckahs and I be brown
Like James, trippin' on a funky sound
I gots the fat, dirty stinkin' fungus
Rollin' down my throat and growin' in my lungus

47 rings from the bins when I swing
I thinks of the past when I smoke my tins
Nowadays I gets paid for the rhymes when I'm bouncin'
At times be trippin' like Richard Branson

So get off my sound, see
You know it ain't yours
It belongs to the P
And the super-high court

Crips they be smilin coz they know they black'n
I rocks the party like (scratching)
When I walk the street I don't fear no man
Coz I wear the steel bandit on my hand

It means "Original G", the Biz Markie,
Sugar-free, Pepsi, max out my Sig,

True MC's are born to fight
Instead-a sellin' out the dance for the limelight
True MC's are born to fight
Instead-a sellin' out to dance for the limelight
Instead-a sellin' out to dance for the limelight
Instead-a sellin' out to dance for the limelight
