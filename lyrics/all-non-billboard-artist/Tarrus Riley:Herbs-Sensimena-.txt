Herbs-Sensimena-:Tarrus Riley
Hi hi highest hi highest
Take me higher higher higher

More time it frustrating
How you deal wid the grades is degrading
And wi nuh intoxicated no

Just true a spliff tail
You waan lock wi in a jail
But when it legalized
Will yo charge disappear

7 days her a find
But the evidence couldn't find
Now you waan mi spend the time a pay the find
And mi waan you fi gimmi bad mind

Gimmi my herbs
My skunk, my long sweat mice
Sensimena, my herbs

This a tripple og cush, shower desil
Mi need you, my herbs

Pepper mint leaf
Bubble life my serusi
Because a my herbs
Unuh gimmi back my herbs

Boy Mr man o
Pon ever level mi defending it
Yo want the knowledge, mi wi lend you it
If you believe in a medicine
This yah plant full a nough benefit
If you reading you bible
Look good you wi seet in a genesis
Babylon, on the pass dem a nemesis
But me and the herbs a nuh enemies

Gimmi my herbs
My skunk, my long sweat mice
Sensimena, my herbs

This a tripple og cush, shower desil
Mi need you, my herbs

Pepper mint leaf
Bubble life my serusi
Because a my herbs
Unuh gimmi back my herbs

Boy Mr man
Pon ever level mi defending it
Yo want the knowledge, mi wi lend you it
If you believe in a medicine
This yah plant full a nough benefit
If you reading you bible
Look good you wi seet in a genesis
Babylon, on the pass dem a nemesis
But me and the herbs a nuh enemies

(Repeat )
Gimmi my herbs
My skunk, my long sweat mice
Sensimena, my herbs

This a tripple og cush, shower desil
Mi need you, my herbs

Pepper mint leaf
Bubble life my serusi
Because a my herbs
Unuh gimmi back my herbs
