It's All True
Life is complicated
it gets me aggrivated
and premeditated
damn 'G'
I done made it
24 years on her
I thanks God
some say life is easy
that's a lie, it's hard
cause you could be gone in a second
think about that
and count your blessings
a lot of homie's in my hood
is straight locked up
cause they had that flake
straight rocked up
wit' some of that funky skunk weed
that'll drop ya' to ya' knees
just simply roll it in a blunt
and it'll sho' get 'cha keyed
I likes to flow real
when I grabs the mic and rap
I simple kick facts
all 'em lies
I ain't got time fa' that
word
it's boring
I'm on a whole differnt level
all this ready floatin' 'round
got most crazy like the devil
I come to ya' real
like otha brothaz can't
cause when people get kill'd
it makes ya think
yo'
whose gon' be the next one in a casket
who done got kill'd
who done got blasted
and when I come to ya'
real 'dem ya' mind gets lost
it's fresh and strictly real
It's all true BOSS

[CHORUS:]
To my people in the ghetto
this is fa' you
you gotta do what you gotta do
cause it's all true
To my people in the ghetto
this is fa' you
you gotta do what you gotta do
cause it's all true

Yo'
think about this
yo'
my people tryna' make it
strugglin' fa' so long
and you know 5-0 hate it
they tryna' fade us
straight out the box
they fly in tha do'
then bust us wit' the ready rock
take a look around
yo' it's goin' down
befo' ya' 6 feet underground
I can tell ya' this
yo' I'm still strugglin'
I'm under a lot of stress
plus things is jugglin'
through my brain
life ain't the same
I mean I'm trapped in the game
and mind 'll bring a brotha pain
yo' I'm straight reminiscing
them days in tha kitchen
when I thought my moms was trippin'
believe it or not BOSS
yo' it all come back and hits ya'
all at once like smack
yo' like Marvin Gaye
ya' betta' watch it
a lot of brothaz is dyin'
over that flake stuff
but what can I say
it's gonna still be sold
cause the people I know
they like to have there pockets swolled
I can't blaim 'em
cause Lord
they got to have 'dem D's
plus 'dem G's
cause yo' it's a lot of keys
It's all true BOSS

To my people in the ghetto

Now think to ya' self

probably cause he broke
plus his job ain't steady
now I'm a tell ya this
bein' broke sho' sucks
a lot a cool homies
in my hood
is straight locked up
fa' dishin' that flake to 'dem
crooked undercovaz
sellin' powder
to them othaz
and coolin' dem
brothaz wit' dem hubbards
now what can I do
cause I come true
always shown up to the onez
that's down dude
they say people in the projects
can't have no change
cause if ya' slang
they don't want you
to have a damn thing
in the nine-fo'
ain't no perpetrators
shoot a brotha
he'll be back like
Swartzenager
199-fo' what the hell has changed
not a got-damn thang
it's all about cocaine
who ya' know and
who ya' owe
yo' were living
in the fast lane
we need to take it slow
it's the year of survival
not enough black folks
tryna' read the Bible
now that's ya' last clue
say what 'cha want to
cause it's all true

To my people in the ghetto

you gotta do what you wanna do
cause it's all true
To my people in the ghetto
