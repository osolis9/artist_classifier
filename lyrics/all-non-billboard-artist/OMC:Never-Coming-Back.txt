Never-Coming-Back:OMC
Siale's gone away and she's never comin' back here again
I understand, I know where you're comin' from
Just take your time, you've planned this since the first time we met, oh

Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back?
Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back?
Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back again?

First time I saw you, you were crowned in silver
You're hair full of fire, I guess you would have been a goddess
Incognito, hiding all my lies, and this year, I was more than content

Ten times my eyes glanced upon your temple
But I never imagine my deep fantasies
In case you really had another lover, another brother

I know your name is desire
The words you speak chocolate coated whispers
You have a style so unique and pure
A vision from up above, I think I'm infatuated by your spirit

As you passed by my eyes
I'm like a little child mesmerized by your magic

Well, ten times my eyes glanced upon your temple
Well, ten times my eyes glanced upon your temple
Time flies when you're havin' fun
Well, time flies when you're havin' fun
Well, time flies when you're havin' fun, well, time flies

Siale's gone away and she's never comin' back here again
I understand, I know where you're comin' from
So take your time, you've planned this since the first time we met

Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back?
Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back?
Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back again?

Time flies when you're havin' fun
Well, time flies when you're havin' fun
Well, time flies when you're havin' fun, well, time flies

Siale's gone away and she's never comin' back here again
I understand, I know where you're comin' from
Just take your time, you've planned this since the first time we met

Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back?
Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back?
Are you ever comin' back? Are you ever comin' back again?
