Maureen
It's hard to explain
I'm never going to see you again
And you'll never meet my new friends
Maureen, I miss you
I just can't explain
I'm never going to see you again
I wish you could meet my new friends

Walking along the subway listening to
Loving you is easy acapella
You were a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-kart town
And I miss you, Maureen

We're as thick as thieves

Maureen maureen
Remember when my mother said to me
Sade don't you come home to late
Till you're back I stay awake

And maureen
With the boys you could tell at a glance
You'd say he looks good
Let'd hope he can dance
Wicky wacky party to the.

Where are we going tonight
And what will you be wearing
Shone like a souped-up car in that rent-a-go-kart town
And I miss you maureen, I miss you girl

You were my best friend
I'm never going to see you again, maureen
And you'll never meet my new friends
You really were a pearl in my world, maureen

Maureen
It's hard to explain
You'll never call round to see me again
You'll never meet my new friends

Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
Never meet my new friends
