Never-That:Goldy
It's money to make and pussy to get, so I'ma make it quick
I might offend but it depends on how you take this shit
Real niggas know, bitch, you be schemin' for your last bone
You pick 'em up and they be stuck, you got your cash on

Then they talk shit, ain't that a bitch, you think your ass grown
You ain't got no cash, I'm out of gas, walk your ass home
Goldy, you feel me when I dog hoes in Oakland city
Should I feel sympathy? Never that, I shows not pity

To a bitch or a goddamn dope fiend
If you smoke cream, muthafucka, then you want green
So don't be smilin' in my face, lookin' cheesy
You need me and ain't no bargains or no freebees

I never have niggas who think they bigger, disrespectin' me
You try that and I'm cuttin' short your life expectancy
A cold gangster, never wastin' no time
You know you got to have nine triggers right in your spine, nigga

So watch your back if you don't think that you can fall, man
Fuck the laws, niggas get downed like tall cans
Ant Diddley Dog on the loose, I ain't a trick snitch
I ain't never gettin' broke by a trick bitch
So if you funny style, come with a better act
Me slippin'? I'm a Oakland gangster, never that

I be that bad-ass nigga in your shit tonight, hoe
With Goldy in the land of funk, just for ninety-fo'
So here we go, really doe, shit, I gotta burp
Rappin' Ron, won't you take it? Shit, my throat hurt

I flow tight on the tracks that y'all lack on
'Cause I got the lyrics and the style to fall back on
So put the smart mack on, breakin' your backbone
I leave your ass dead in a casket with all black on

That's what Ron'll do off the bomb and brew
Fuck up you and your crew and your mama too
Peace be out to you, asalaam alaikum
But if a nigga talk that shit, watch how I'ma break him

'Cause I'm a vet quick to set muthafuckas straight
My rhymes are airtight, makin' brothers suffocate
So brothers wait and puff and take a deep breath
'Cause with the strong jab, you ain't gon' have teeth left

So run yo' mouth and you can get your chin broke
Call your mama and your daddy, go get your kinfolk
'Cause I'm quick to go into throwin' you into a ditch
See I'm doin' this showin' you that you a bitch

And I take ya like a cup of coffee, you're just a softie
You better back the fuck up off me
Tellin' niggas you could beat me, of course you can lie
But if you get up, you get lit up like the 4th of July

'Cause you'se a weak-ass nigga
And you've done never practiced
And me fall off on the mic, never that, bitch

She's a seditty hoe but she dropped the pantyhose
She seen me in videos and she jocked me for cameos
All the time I'm in the Oak, pal, horny as totem smile
And bitches let me dick 'em 'cause I'm kickin' it with pearls now

Ain't got no zinas and vogues, I just got penis for hoes
Ain't got no dough but she owe me
The bitch is cleanin' my clothes
Cocaine to powder her nose, she rode around in a rolls
With some muthafucka I don't really know

Goddamn, gettin' high and gettin' drunk
Nigga, I ain't a chump but I come with some funk
Back on the track, muthafucka stayin' black
Dick grows long like a fuckin' Cadillac

Bitch, get with this or bitch, get with that
A stack for the cat? Bitch, never that
When a nigga's gettin' laid 'cause your ass'll get played
On the next fuckin' record now bitch get naked

It's that yellow-ass nigga with the shadow side burns
Sittin' low to the right makin' wild turns
I make my rounds down the track in my drop Rome
Droppin' the hoes off, pickin' the cash up
Floatin' on gold, not chrome

Diamonds on my fingers big as do' knobs
My hoes ride the back, my main bitches give me blow jobs
Rolex link, dressed in Cartier, carat diamonds
I watch 'em jock and give me props 'cause the girl's blinded

Presidential 'Lex on the stearin' wrist
Parlay links are made of diamonds sittin' clear and crisp
Take it from a mack, no bitch is too hard to knock
Too good to hoe or too fine to jock

Hey you, can I do you a favor?
Give you the better things in life 'cause you'se my flavor
If you're with it, drop your panties and tap your heels twice
Repeat after me and wake up to somethin' all nice
There's no place like the land of funk
There's no place like the land of funk

Then you fall into a magical sleep and awake
Standin' on a hoe stroll flirtin' with Tonto
Welcome to the land of funk where everythin' is gold
In the plants, in the trees all the tricks know
The breeze be at ease

I'm the wizard of the land, follow the golden bricks
'Cause you be fuckin' 'em, makin' em men, suckin' and holdin' dicks
And once you kick me down
I'm breakin' you off and givin' you some
I'm keepin' you dressed, I'm payin' yo hit and let you drive for fun

So hoe or die, bitch, make your mind up
You're lined up and signed up, but your girlfriends wind up
Collar-poppin'-broke-fake-Louis-purse-wearin' tramps
Tryin' to join the next nigga camp

Suck my dick like a lollipop
'Cause you can't make no money with that sloppy cock
You shouldn'ta never tried to play me, I'm a clever cat
I pay you when you work, give you money, bitch, never that

Now all you square-ass busta hoes know what time it is
With these Richmond and Oakland players, huh?
We got some real true players in the house
Let me yell em out while they in front of my muthafuckin' face
We got the muthafuckin' funkmaster P Double Double E

Pee Wee in the muthafuckin' house
Ant Biggedy muthafuckin' Bankster
What's up Big Banks, you fartin', burpin' muthafucka
We got fat ass Kris

Lil' Shawn just hooked up with the crew
Asey muthafuckin' pimp-ass player from the Richtown
These just niggas in the house I'm just yellin' out

We got big-ass ballin' ass Funktown Dave in here
Is it all good, Dave? What's up, mayn, what's goin' on?
It's all good, I'ma wind it up, take it on home right now

We got Ant Diddley muthafuckin' Dog comin' 9000 strong
And I'm out to be out this muthafucka
