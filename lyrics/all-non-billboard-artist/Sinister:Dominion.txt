Dominion:Sinister
Sign of the cross, symbol of hatred
Tribulation
Across this land, signs of the beast
Everlasting rape
Ravished and scorned, silenced by madness
The world will burn

Dominate the law
Laws of dominion
Conquer the pain
True dominance of death

Dominion

Tempted and distressed
Underworld of doom
Ungodly act of disaffection
Stranded and confined

I'm the havoc, the vulture of transmission
Coroner and king
The art of true extinction

Dominion [3x]

Obey my legions of pain
Suffering, divine or insane
The horror build from inside
When both world will collide

[solo: Pascal]

Dominate the law
Laws of dominion
Conquer the pain
True dominance of death

Tempted and distressed
Underworld of doom
Ungodly act of disaffection
Stranded and confined

I'm the havoc, the vulture of transmission
Coroner and king
The art of true extinction
