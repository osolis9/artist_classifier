Super-Baller:Lil' Blacky
I hits the gin & juice shadow pulls up in the impala
he gives me the scoop about em wanna be ballas
how fools out there wanna play
i take another hit on the way then i blast away
far enough to go off the edge
im pushin anotha busta off the ledge
so i stumbled as i head towards the lex
i got my dick on hold and all im thinkin about is sex
im a shot callin' baller is what they call me when im comin
got the dolla sign on my chest so im probably gunnin
hi-powered out of my way, crusinin with a side
to check upon my riches is hella drive, so drive on
as i lean to my side with my don perignon
big ballin is what i do, fools in my crew
dont take lightly to these bustas and so we say fuck you
then buck you tuck you in for the night
while im out here makin chips you at your funeral sight
so when im hangin with the click & we countin em dollas
i feel good cuz everybody in my hood call me mr. super balla

does anybody know that super baller
does anybody see that super baller
yeah.now it was once said by lil OG
always tryin to come up & make a G
cuz when i bust like a curse
cuz see once in a lifetime, everyone does some dirt
i guess it's gots to mean the same
so at the age of sixteen i enter the rap game
i had my raps logged down tight
in the day i went to school but i wrote all night
and when i went to class i always fell asleep
but i was up like a mothafucka if you had a beat
my teacher say blacky cant it wait
i said no i gots to put some mo' icing on my cake
i think i made about 50 G's
i bought a lex, a house, & a cutlass on D's
moms is trippin but she really dont know
and all im thinkin is she aint on the county no mo'
before my moms fuck with the county again
i rather take the chance of doing five to ten
im not taking a chance
im straight making a chance
so now i deserve to take what ima get
i bought my mama house and got straight
cuz all you mothafuckas just playahate
yo, you really wanna know why im so paid
cuz my money to me it means everything
and to you broke ass bitches making no dollas
and to my family, im a real super balla

super baller, super baller
