How you seen the ghost of John?
Long white bones and the rest all gone
Oooooh
Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?
Oooooh
Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?
I got a bone to pick with you, uh huh
"In the back of a building, your body's found by children" - Wyclef 'Apocalypse'
"All they found was your skeleton" - Wyclef 'Apocalypse'
Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?

[Verse One]
Mums the word (word)
Over amplified whispers, we heard the system failed through hand held transistors
Spilling the beans for so long we hid these flaws
Naked truth as Adam and Eve without fig leaf drawers
When your pops moonlight as a child pornographer smuggler
Your Aunt Linda is really your mom's lesbian lover
Or when the FEDs primary snitch is your seed's ol' earth
Lost to Willie Lynch logic, you still believe it's a curse
The world's worst death was in a kiss
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing us he didn't exist
This ghost town was once rare grooves and shattered snare drums
Cramped basement jams, suburbia wouldn't dare come
The death of an era gave birth to a phase
Frantic crowd calling "nigger" till we surrendered the trade
(Nigger?)
Now 'who stole the soul' because the phrase
When only eight niggas at the show and six of 'em is on stage

[Verse Two]
Skeleton's don't fight fair, expose your worst nightmare
Coming out the closet with the truth about your right there
Yeah, you got a right to be scared, airing out your dirty laundry
Those raunchy dark secrets
All people creep with hidden agendas to name a few
Infidelity and cheating
Incestuous, even their therapist are in therapy needing understanding
Our heart bleeding, hurting, mad stay liberating brother
Like the legend Weldon Irving
Thought I got bones to pick with a suicidal person
Eyes wide shut, living awful talk shows, if that's your gospel
According to John's song
All your skeleton's got a right to be wrong
Have you seen him?
