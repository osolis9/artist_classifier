Rock-the-Bells:Tanya Morgan
Very good
I rub the genie out the bottle
And use all 3 wishin' a nigga would
I'm no cool rapper, I break sweats
I can take a joke but it's better to take checks
While you writin' about me don't forget:
We don't need the hype, just the dopest shit
Why are they so offended that I hold my tip?
C'mon, it's rap, that behavior's appropriate
Without question, I can't put my city on a map
But I can give 'em directions
More interesting than the rest get
No sex tape in the press kit
Brooklyn accent, boogey down, fitted (?)
Oregon kicks, Mexican drinks with my Detroit chick
How do I rap both well and sick?
I blame common sense

Now, lemme see your hands
If you're out to get them grands (grams?)
Then split it up with your fans
Say "I am" (I am)

Yo, I'm in the best shape I ever been
Rare form's the norm
And I'm scarred up from battlin'
War torn and scorn
'bout a better view - birds eye
Credit do deserve ???
Let a few words fly, shit I ain't concerned, I
I'm on the A-train listenin' to my flame
Thinkin' to myself Zo! and Tig did the damn thing
??? sayin' top ten to we ain't even got spin
More breasts, less profit, still all win
We be, I'm is group shit or solo
We made history, little to no promo
Used to say "hipstory" but that's hip-hop
They can labor it to death but can't make this stop
Can't break this up
What up Ilyas
Last text message told me to give y'all hell
Can't kill it, won't die
Can't feel it, won't try
???
Sell the big dope rhymes

Said can I kick it?
Yes you can!
(x3)
Well I'm gone
Now let me see those hands

Now, let me see your hands
If you're out to get them grands
And split it up with your fans
Say "I am" (I am)
