White-Suburban:Skylar Grey
I knew you before
Took a lifetime to forget
But have my eyes meet yours
I take all I can get
They light, up the shadows of my heart
Return stolen works of art
Yet, you can't discern this moments, grace

But I, still remember you
In that big old White Suburban
And though you look right past, me with disregard
The first won't happen twice

My gaze shifts to the ground
More alone than I was then
I have searched your eyes but they don't comprehend
I crawl, back into the shadows of my heart
And just sit there in the dark
Where you don't requite the love you still take

But I, still remember you
In that big old White Suburban
And though you look right past, me with disregard
And although I've since moved on
And I've been in love a few times
There's still a piece of me that holds on to you
Cuz the first won't happen twice
It won't happen twice
It won't happen twice, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh

Oooooo I remember you
In that big old White Suburban
And although you look right past me with disregard
And although I've since moved on
And I've been in love a few times
There's still a piece of me that can't let go of you
Cuz the first won't happen twice
