Na-na-na, na-na-na

Na-na-na, na-na-na
C'mon!

Na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na (c'mon, c'mon!)
Na, na-na-na-na-na (yeah!)
Na-na-na, na-na-na (sing along with it!)
Na, na-na-na-na-na (yeah!)
Na-na-na, na-na-na (get down with yo' bad self!)
Na, na-na-na-na-na (word 'em up!)
Na-na-na, na-na-na (yeah!)

I dwell in the darkest of places
Planet Earth, everything tasteless, everybody sound kinda brainless
Roll the herb and play the verse
Staying immersed in crime, think politics perverse
Every day is like May the first in Haymarket Square
Heard a lot of martyrs there
Making everybody's shit list
Government to corporate, take back the gas and water shit
Class War in effect
Autonomist populace, hardcore to the death
Anti-fascista, John Carpenter creature
Terrorising grooves made to reach ya
Custom built to feel, fuck paying for brand new clothes
And looking good for your bros, huh
I rock a rag with a bloodstain on it
And get more props than I wanted
Make you feel like.

I want a summer of love, feeling good, got someone to love
John Lennon, no Gods, no nothing above
Rock Steady Crew cutting a rug
On the mic like Soulsonic, 808 drum is a drug
Stuck in my room, nothing to do
Getting paranoid, feeling like Iran with a bucket of crude
Twenty-six thousand nukes with nothing to do
McDonald's and them Reeboks coming for you
Need a cupboard of food and a roof and I'm straight
Fucking utter contempt if you run up and tempt fate
Back in the tenth grade was a Don Juan
Cutting school in the days, ducking rays from a cop car
With a Posca on the same bus my dad drove
Did he care? Fuck nah
I'm a chip off the old block
Pissed off and never get a break outa life, but so what?
Uh!

Rising above like Rollins in Black Flag
Pissing in your Louis Vuitton handbag
Treating 'em worse than the Grand Dragon in the Klan
Vents taking a stand, propaganda by the bedside lamp
Your blood on your boyfriend's Skyline floor
Let the eyeline pour when it's time for war
You denying the dinosaur
Swearing that God created man, but God enslaving man
With the church and the capitalists
2007, still both tryna gaffle my shit
Had to resist, accurate, how could it miss?
Game of death, Billy Lo type powerful fist
Kind of weird like having a brisk
Cutting your child's dick to get closer to God, it sounds sick huh
I see 'em in the club spazzing out
But smoking ice ain't nothing to brag about
I make you wanna.

Hah-ha yeah, it's a love song
Get your food, eat your dinner, get your desert
Sing alooong!
