Evermore:Kashmir
I close my eyes and then it's here
just as i thought it would never show
I'm closing in on someone dear
with words unknown and tales untold

Something i'm afraid to lose
Something i would swear i could refuse

And i'm giving in;
to the wide open gap
And i never want to return here again
no. no

I'm waking up and then it's gone
just as i thought she'd come along
I'm sure she waited long enough
but i was harboring above

I'm crawling out;
of the wide open gap
And i never want to fall in again
. no
And though i know that it makes her feel sad;
i never want to crawl in again
no. no

Evermore. evermore
Evermore. no one waits for;
Evermore. evermore
Evermore. no one waits for.

I thought it'd never come back.
But when it did
I thought it'd always be there.
But when it died
I thought it'd never come back.
But when it did
I thought it's always be there.
But when it died
I thought it'd never come back.
But when it did
I thought it'd always be there...
