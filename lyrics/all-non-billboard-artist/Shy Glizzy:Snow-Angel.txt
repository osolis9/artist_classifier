Snow-Angel:Shy Glizzy
I'm scratched before I go, man, I really need to vacate
My first time on a DJ, oh, shit, nigga, mayday
Hit 20 pounds, how the fuck he shoot the AK
I shoot a nigga down, man, I put that shit on payday
Tied an old murder on my neck, I don't fuck arrest
Scar on my chest, fuck bitches, you can blame the x
I wanna marry Nicky, too, I might just sound weird best
You don't got them bricks, do you, no, I'm just chopping this
When I was 13 I had a best friend named Pedro
Pedro eat a plug, now, he got them by the caseload
He gonna keep 'em coming as long as there ain't no delay, yo
All these niggas round me shooters, they go when I say so

Snow angel
I'm so high that I can make a snow angel
Snow angel
It's a cold world, I feel like a snow angel

I think I seen my enemy the other day
He saw me, turned around, and went the other way
I think I saw my old hoe the other day
She say she want me back, there ain't no other man
My cousin got smoked out the other day, put bullets in his Chevrolet
Everywhere, even in his face, bang, bang, Glizzy, baby
And I been getting money, don't know what they do
I made a snow angel for all that stuff you do
I'm gonna go buy a brick in the morning
And if you ain't here you need to join in
It's Glizzy, baby, Glizzy gang, baby
Niggas call me night and day, ain't no aim, baby
I'm the man and I'm 'bout to cop a Range, baby
I know the man and he got cocaine, baby
So much damn coke that I can make a snow angel
Rest in peace Griselda Blanco, she a snow angel

Snow angel
I'm so high that I can make a snow angel
Snow angel
It's a cold world, I feel like a snow angel
