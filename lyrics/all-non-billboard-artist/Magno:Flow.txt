Flow:Magno
Magno, ya heard, a.k.a Magnificent, mayn
CEO of Wildlife Records, just wanna let everybody know
The New Print, all flows is in sto's now, go knock it off, mayn
You wanna cop it from the net?
Wildliferecords.com, go catch it, mayn

But uh, for now we finna get down to business
You know I'm sayin'?
DJ OP what it do, baby? Killa Tone
Haha, finna go ahead and get it crunked up, you know I'm sayin'?
Houston, stand up, baby, yeah, yeah

It's Magno, man, I'm straight from Houston
Me droppin' whack shit? Man, I'm straight refusin'
That's the reason why my weight be movin'
You wanna hate you losin', this thang'll give your face contusions

In Miami, my dates be Cuban, my bodyguards Haitian
Okay, that's just in case anybody starts hatin'
We turn 'em into patients
They fam' in the lobby or the hospital pacin'

I'm the thoedest, I'ma make you hear it
Since my rhymes give me cake, I'ma bake the lyrics
When I drop, first day crack a thousand, make the majors look
Usin' move they wife, open housin' hits they neighborhood

Sometimes it gets arousin' when a hater would
Tryin' to stop my shine or stunt my growth
Like I won't cock this nine or jump they folk
Then giggle with my feet up watchin' Jimmy Kimmel

Mag' thoed, but the rest be strackin'
I keep a gal and a side hoe like Jessie Jackson
I don't try to act hard like the rest be actin'
I'm a Greenspoint rookie still in vest be Jacklin

When I bust open the door it's like Nestle crackin'
What's up to Acres Home where them techs be crappin', holla
This the North, birds chirp and we spittin' raps
And we don't wear church shirts with a fitted cap

We on the block, tall tee with a doo-rag
Swangin' in that new Jag, trunk bangin' that new Mag'
I don't care, for the reputation this fool has
I'm just tryin' to rap with the dedication that Screw had

Now if y'all want DJ OP to play Deetha I
Y'all gotta get louder than that
They want ya Deetha, they want ya

Think you skatin' on this ice like the tongues of a dyke
They panties in my glass, bitches know what I like
I get ass in that Jag, scoot over for your friends
I got sucker twin at Mag', it's over for them

Fly if you like but I got hollow friends
That'll get deep inside you like you high off the life
Heinekein or Bud Light, I import my domestics
Make sure your ass is speedy, that's how we get down in Texas

Holdin' covers of the Vibe and the Source
I stroll through the hood, never married
Though I've been through divorce
Makeshift attitude, took a course on how to easy bake the dope
Dough risin' bitches got me in court

Half violent, half strivin' for some fuckin' import
That re-sample one that, that make you pay for the bag
And they ain't never ever gotta speak to this man
Never ever's too soon, I'd just assume be glad

How you feel? Fuck with ya and I'll pray for hope missin'
The good that spoke wisdom, pay the thug protection
My investment cop an Expedition
When rims spin around in these circles like gravity switchin'

Fuckin' pagin' that paper means we surely missin'
I got cash now, they kiss my black ass now
When the lights dim down they still spot the cash cow
Wildlife sellin' like some McDonald's hash browns

Haha, straight 'em up, mayn, that's how we do it
Wildlife Records 2004 and beyond, ya heard
Wildliferecords.com, Magno, Deetha, Savor, CEO's of Wildlife
Holla at ya boy, mayn, DJ OP, what it do, baby?
Killa Tone, holla at ya boy, mayn, we eatin' tracks for a snack
