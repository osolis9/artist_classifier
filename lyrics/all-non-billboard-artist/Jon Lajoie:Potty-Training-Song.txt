Potty-Training-Song:Jon Lajoie
Hello boys and girls,
It's time to learn about potty time.
Do you feel a ca ca in your bum-bum
or a pee-pee in your wee-wee?
Well, come along and sing with me

Poo-poo comes out of your bum
And it makes funny noises
(Farting noises)

Poo poo comes out of your bum
But you should do it in the toilet.
And if you have to do a pee pee
Do it in the potty
Peeing in your pants is really really naughty.

This applies to some old people too.
