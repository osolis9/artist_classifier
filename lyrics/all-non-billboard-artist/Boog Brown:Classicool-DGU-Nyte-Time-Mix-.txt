Classicool-DGU-Nyte-Time-Mix-:Boog Brown
Society had them all in a chokehold
But since the queen rose, they keep it so so, fool
Truth unfolds and truth be told that I found the gold and
Broke the mold, bring the homeland to the zone, man
These bro hands sow that
'silence you can keep but at this point I need to speak
So miss me where she bitching shit, that shit will have you re-indicted
Talk to me better talk right, ain't waiting for no bouncing checks
I'm on the move, catch me in between grooves
Taking trips to mind's eye, the third class
With only H2O in the glass, better sun's up
And headphones to match my phone
Stuck to flipping and made it out the city soon
To embrace the earth's winds, ill and broken arms behold
The alignment of the constellations, love is still my promotion
No exaggeration

From the start we knew this shit was so classicool
We dedicate raps to you
You have the head nods and daps to prove
My people gotta make moves
Riding like the day is new, we'll leave the youngling lads for you
LP's getting live with it and that's the truth

If they ain't tryna take it, I ain't tryna give it
I wouldn't believe it myself if I ain't live it
I ain't gonna take your things, used to be much better
The snakes always clear the rats, always chase cheddar
But 20/20 eyesight of the trendsetter
When he sees his younger brother arrive it's tougher than leather
Sets to play protector but I'm like f it, that should get you all stars
And learn more than any professor's lectures
When years become 'and those who you thought they just dressed up jesters
Your request justeshes, I bless you like a sneeze
No struggle without ease, no hustle without sleep
No matter what they believe, see the weary in a week
Get beat tryna compete with Pete
I say move from me, they try to act like my tongue speaking Greek
So when they come seeking me for whatever on me
I don't trust them, they got their weapons on me

From the start we knew this shit was so classicool
We dedicate raps to you
You have the head nods and daps to prove
My people gotta make moves
Riding like the day is new, we'll leave the youngling lads for you
LP's getting live with it and that's the truth

Vibing thing, careful with my aim, never bang without a purpose
Work lost to the dirt, cover up, keep my cup half full for lunching
Pulling no punches, no fronting, let the sun in
Sonic, the bionic woman, boy, you keep them flows flooded
Working with what it is, no concern but what it wasn't
Blundering buffoons try to step up but they lose
Tied the noose tight, conscious of my birth right
Never lose sight of my objective
Got a lesson in my left hand, gun up on my right palm
Calm in the storm, they smelling and keep me warm
I'm so prevalent when going through song, steady Melanie killing
But keep the felony underneath the money tree
Never throwing shade, up late, the hand I'm dealt
Felt the breeze, never living on my knees
Believe, I keep it pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing

From the start we knew this shit was so classicool
We dedicate raps to you
You have the head nods and daps to prove
My people gotta make moves
Riding like the day is new, we'll leave the youngling lads for you
LP's getting live with it and that's the truth
