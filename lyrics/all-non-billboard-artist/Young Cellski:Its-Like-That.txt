Its-Like-That:Young Cellski
Peep game, you silly bustas, you so-called Gs
Poppin at your brain with this game that got niggas coppin keys
I'm droppin these bombs and many more for months and years
At this shit like a jacker with no muthafuckin fear
The shit that I'm droppin got you caught up in my slang
Ever since a young nigga was out here on my bang
Ready to kill if I feel that I got played
I then grabbed my stolen bucket and them niggas was gettin sprayed
That's the pass, a nigga shouldn't reminisc
Still smoke dank, drinkin Hen and take a 8-ball piss
Tryna be a player but rappers, stay away from haters in the streets
Cause that hating makes a nigga come viciously
But jealousy tells me that these niggas simple-minded
And so I might get my 9 and help these niggas find it
Scream if you heard me, holla if you feel me
I'm a threat to society, that's why these muthafuckas tryna kill me
All for the good cause yo if it sends me to the edge
I end up at puttin hollow points to your head
On the move, some punk niggas tried to off me
Got the nina, nigga seen the sign, don't cross me
Cause shit is thick in the Fog so be a hog when I rush ya
Stay away from all these playa haters and these bustas
And you wonder why I stay strapped with my gat?
Cause livin up in the Fog it's like that cuz
(And you know I had to gat ya)
It's like this and like that and like this and, uh
It's like that and like this and like that and, uh
x4
Mashin in my Lark, kinda keyed of some dank weed
Got the nina in my lap in case some niggas tryna gank me
Cause in the inner city niggas quickly to snap
Niggas get they caps peeled and niggas peel caps
Because it's real, niggas on the grind to survive
Because a nigga ain't down for a 9 to 5
Give me a suck up on the Hen and a 9 miller
And I'll show you how to roll up in my city
Cause it's kinda sick livin in the Fog, niggas get smoked
(?) pistol cause it's personal beef, punk
Niggas can't fade and you hoes can't fade
Niggas get smoked for tryna act bitch made
Be a playa not a saver-up cause in these jungelous
And then I'll be all good at the end, then I'll bring up folks
Straight niggas from the street, straight from the penetentiary
Havin much ass and smokin on the rider's weed
Cause niggas don't understand this shit unless you live up in Cali
Where niggas are bangin and slangin in front of the white man, dead up in the alley
Cause real niggas don't give a fuck
And that's the niggas I fuck with so you better watch out, punk
I pop-pop-pop with this muthafuckin giggityglock
I make sure that when I pop niggas got to drop
Cause I'm straight from the D-O
Each and everyday a nigga's runnin from the popo
It's like this, it's like that, so when I stay strapped with my gat
You better run and hide before I rat-ta-ta-tat on that ass as I blast!
With this fucking SIG!
Wouldn't give a FUCK if I'm bustin at these muthafuckin nigs!
Cause niggas always on my nutsack!
Niggas tried to bust at me, that's when a nigga bust back!
Then I got to run and throw my fucking gat, cause nigga!
It's just like that, foo'
