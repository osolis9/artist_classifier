I-m-a-Dog:Jelly Roll
Hold on, baby you know the deal
You know, that I'm a keep it real
Till then, baby I'm on the grind
One day, baby you will be mine
My girl keep telling me that I'm a dog
I can't keep messing with these broads
It don't make no sense at all
Why does she still answer my calls
She knows that, I'm a keep it G
Hold on, baby you know the deal
I'm just doing me
You know, that I'm a keep it real
One day it will be we
Till then, baby I'm on the grind
Just have some trust in me
One day, baby you will be mine
Just have some trust in me
Maybe it's the way I move
Maybe it's the things I do
How I'm a gentleman
And I'm a gangsta too
Ain't running no game on you
Ain't like these lame ass dudes
Big boy, fat boy, Mac, teach you a thing or two
Cause you know that I beat it up
You know that I beat it up
You also know I'm thinking of to go downtown and eat it up
You sweeter than a Reese's cup
Slow it down then speed it up
Slow back down then speed it up
You know I love that freaky stuff
Cool
I ain't tripping baby nothing has changed
I'm so cool I'm staying dry when I'm stuck in the rain
I swear to God I keep it so real that it's fucking insane
On top of that I'm so high I think I'm up on a plane
It's the sweetest smell of a lady
Something bout it drive me crazy
And she got that Aquafina I love when it's freshly shaven
And when she gets to moaning man I go so hard
I wake her up, every morning with that "oh my God"
And then it's back to the grind again
It's time again, this time I'm a win
Only real dudes gon come ride with him
So gon bag a bad bitch tell her find a friend
We can do that there, do this too
Man it's kinda strange what the music do
Man it's kinda lame what these dudes'll do
Try to give you dap, I ain't cool with you
Still keep it smooth when I move through the city
Bout to meet Rell, got a bad bitch with' me
I don't even care what the critics say really
Better be money if they talking bout Jelly
Don't wear Gucci that ain't my style
I don't give a fuck if they hate me now
Came from the bottom, rose to the top
Yes I'm a dog I say it proud
