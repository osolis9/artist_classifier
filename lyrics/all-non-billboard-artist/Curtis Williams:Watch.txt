Watch:Curtis Williams
Said, rolling up when I want to
Drinking good when I want to
Riding round with my main bitch
She got her own weed, she stay blunted
Can't say a young nigga ain't stunting
Talk a lot boy, but they ain't saying nothing
I'm walking, I'm talking like money
Probably on the beach, nigga where it's sunny
Came a long way, but we ain't done yet
Smoking on a blunt where the sun set
Nigga want a verse, where my funds at
Nigga smoke something, where your lungs at?
Say you smoke good, we don't smell that
Say you run the city, can't tell that
Pack on the way, where my mail at
And we smoke it all, we don't sell that
