Keep-It-On:Nonce
It's 85 y'all 
It's 85 y'all 
I said it's 86 y'all 
85, 86, 83 

Nouka: 

It's 8:48 and two hours left 
The board is staring straight at Sef 
Grabbing for my piece of paper but the haper 
Cause I'm flowing today 
Plus I, what to say 
First I look up and then I check the time 
Then I get the caper to my old school rhyme 
It's like that y'all 
You know I don't stop 
That Eighty-five hip hop (come on) 
Step in sure shot cause the plate is burning 
The table is spinning 
And you know I'm winning 
Now check it out y'all 
You know I rock on 
Don't freak it by the force cause you know we keep on 
My mellow 
To the label was stable 
Packs to the shows giving pounds to the bro's 
It's 9:05 and we're kicking live 
What you know about the place that we used to survive 
Now it's 9:10 just letting the wheels spin 
When it gets it to the end 
Tell `em cue it again 
It's like that y'all 
You know I don't stop 
Now everybody rock, come on
