Exodus:Pusha T
Pusha T]
Beef is best served like steak
Well done get a gun in your face, b*tch n*gga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other n*ggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin them triggers, f*ck n*ggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke yours don't look like ours

Them n*ggas ain't dying for you
Them n*ggas ain't dying for you
(Throwing that flag up running around you hot sh*t
Taking half of everything you get)
Them n*ggas ain't dying for you
Them n*ggas ain't dying for you
And we know that

Contract all f*cked up
I guess that means you all f*cked up
You signed to one n*gga that signed to another n*gga
that's signed to three n*ggas
Now that's bad luck
Damn that sh*t even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's are camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves career sabotaged
I was really in that travel lodge
You just lying through your catalogs
Where the blood and the battle scars?
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
Put me to the body
First 48 put us to them bodies
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, n*gga
We'd much rather share your b*tch, n*gga, b*tch n*gga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you n*ggas hate us
F*ck you playing games for?
Don't be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big sh*t
Little do you know we don't miss sh*t
Them n*ggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here by yourself
Ask Steve Jobs' wealth don't buy health

Beef is best served like steak
Well done get a gun in your face, b*tch n*gga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other n*ggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin them triggers, f*ck n*ggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke yours don't look like ours

Them n*ggas ain't dying for you
Them n*ggas ain't dying for you
(Throwing that flag up running around you hot sh*t
Taking half of everything you get)
Yeah, them n*ggas ain't dying for you
Them n*ggas ain't dying for you
(And we know that)

What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
