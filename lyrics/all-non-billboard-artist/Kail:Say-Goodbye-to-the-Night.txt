Say-Goodbye-to-the-Night:Kail
green eyed lady dancing with the firelight
just to make a living having visions by the riverside
if we were lost i think we're found now
come one come all as the morning shines out

say goodbye to the night
it aint far now burning bright
cross your fingers and hope to die
say goodbye to the night

leave my lover never let it pass by
just one thing for one more life time
if we were lost i think we're found now
come one come all as the morning shines out

say goodbye to the night
say goodbye to the night
it aint far your burning so bright
so say goodbye to the night
say goodbye to the night
know its for you burnin so bright
so cross your fingers and hope to die
saygoodbye to the night
say goodbye to the night
say goodbye to the night
its all for ya burnin bright
say goodbye to the night
