Close-to-the-Edge:Merkules
Please just leave me alone, cause I wanna live my life
This ain't no family, what you're doing to me just ain't right
Can't let it go to my head, I'm standing close to the edge
Let's have a toast to the dead, I gotta hope for the best

A good kid, 13, he had a bright future
His dad was an alcoholic and a drug user
His mom died when he was seven from a stroke
So getting piss drunk was the only way he could cope
And some would hope that he'd treat his son right
But he doesn't when he's drinking, all he wants to do is fight
Life, is a beautiful thing
He says the pain doesn't hurt him cause it's more of a sting
Livingroom covered in blood like it's a ring
The bottle had dissolved what the memories bring
His son had friends that he'd only see at school
But he was not a fool, so they said he wasn't cool
Followed the rules, but he wasn't scared to break 'em
Cause his father was a bully, didn't have the heart to face him
His friends knew it was wrong but let him hurt him
His dad is only mad, cause his son is a better person (c'mon)
Was it worth it? All the pain and the agony?
It's almost like the reaper gets his way when he's mad at me
It's a tragedy, feeling like it's lose - lose
And too escape it, all he needs to do is use booze
You wouldn't last a day, walking in this dudes shoes
So fucking out of it he can't decide for who's who
Now he's lost and he's searching for some new clues
That's what he gets for not listening, so boo-hoo

Please just leave me alone, cause I wanna live my life
This ain't no family, what you're doing to me just ain't right
Can't let it go to my head, I'm standing close to the edge
Let's have a toast to the dead, I gotta hope for the best

15 now, he's falling out of class
Started drug dealing so he's saving up some cash
He's on his last rock cause he gave it too his dad
Soon he'll have enough paper to pay for his own flat
But if he does it then his dad will be stunned
Cause the only thing he ever really had was his son
Underneath the pillow where he stashes his gun
When he got it he would go out, and just blast it for fun
Now he needs it cause the crack and the scums
See he forgot about his family, and that's number 1
Moved out, now his dads just a bum
Every now and then he'd hand over the last of his crumbs
It's sad cause his mum would be crying if she knew it
Lookin' down on him like "Why you gotta do this?"
So stupid, but he felt he never had the chance
So when he meets with the devil, he better do the dance
All his friends looking up too him like, "you the man"
Cause they see him make som money off of moving grams
So impressionable he was always willing
'Till he sold his dad the crack that actually killed him (that's a shame)

Please just leave me alone, cause I wanna live my life
This ain't no family, what you're doing to me just ain't right
Can't let it go to my head, I'm standing close to the edge
Let's have a toast to the dead, I gotta hope for the best
