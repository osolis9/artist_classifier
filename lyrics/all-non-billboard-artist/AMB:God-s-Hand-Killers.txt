God-s-Hand-Killers:AMB
We are all children of God

Here comes another one
He here comes another one
Demons die
D d demons die
I'm a gods Hand killer

Gimme me my list I got this sick vision in my head
I grip a axe in my fist
D demons die
Every time I trip n squeeze the life out of a haters neck
I got anger in my blood all pumpin through my chest
Gimme the weapons and a blessin as my anger manifest
I'm a monster worse than a public official with no conscience outta control you can't stop us
What nope not eva givin a fuck
I call sleepin with a dead bitch bleedin livin it up
Hell naw but I gets raw with wut I mus
WA WAR OF THE WORLD
My axe turn you into dust
Give it up to the west side wicked all day
We get it done
The only begotten sons don't play
I'm a ryda
And if you mutha fuckas lookin to survive
Change your life act right and get canonised

I move smooth with the stealth of a stalker
Death before dishonour like a suicide bomber
I bomb on ya the life force of karma
Be forcin my decision to get wicked and call slaughter
My enemies
The devil ain't no freind to me
My axe burns with the light of my destiny
I'm blessed to see
Blood on the river
Souls I deliver
Bitch I'm a gods hand killer

Fuck the way in your brains
Takin my ginsu in your fuckin membrane
Is that for pain
I let it rain on a mutha fuckin bitch
And then I slain
So say my fuckin name in vane BONEZ DUBB
They call me that cause I'm ready for my fate
My wicked memories remind me of the hate
Not that I regulate
I rep the A X E
Slammin the blade up in your head
But I'm on the hunt for police
Gonna take one SHOT
Gonna hit the POT
Gonna fuck the COPS
Gonna watch them DROP
And gonna keep the peace from the Dubb to the east
Rippin' through the streets Fuckin' alive but I'm deceased
I can see the demon beast gotta grip a fuckin' piece You weak
Ready to take 'em all and say it's wrong
To slit a muthafuckin' throat and use the blood in a bong
Somebody realize we gonna die
The ways you spend the after life is what's on my mind
Ready to say fuck you to all the demons
You muthafuckas know that we got mad reasons
The season of damnation in a cold-blooded heart
Revolution recognizin' steady watchin' from the start
From the paralyzin' souls survivin' I don't be givin' a fuck at all
Bonez Dubb is cutting' throats Pro dope and Anti coke
Y'all know me I keep it real for the rillas
Bustin' off bullets in you sinners, We the God's Hand Killas
