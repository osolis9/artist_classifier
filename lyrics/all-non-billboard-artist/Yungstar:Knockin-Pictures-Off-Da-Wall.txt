Knockin' Pictures Off Da Wall
CHORUS:
Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall

As i come around your block turnin heads and ridin slow
with a pocket full of money but i gots to get mo
staying grain about a thang as i swoop from lane to lane
so we can say when i can bang with like a piece without a chain
got me, knock me, but that kind of stuff don't stop me
since i wanna be a balla got the world wanna watch me, 
don't hate just wait for me to skate down ya street
ball out smoke a sweet with benjamin franklins on my feet
bald fade hit em with shade never afros and braids, 
we stackin can of raid cause all roaches getting sprayed
not cappin just a reala still making playa choices, 
So the next choice is from the heart hear my name in different voices, 
Juiced up and toed down on my flip makin my rounds, 
smellin like a pound drippin finna paint your town, 
makin way how I play leanin' hard unless you doze 
Hopped up with ?? and vogues, 
with matching floors and starch ya clothes

Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall

Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall

Now we mobbin for real flippin' lexus to deal
Mashin 90 on the field with a dark senorita
and some long haired Italians, piece and chain medalions,
my currency increasin, I'm droppin 50 on ya gallon, 
i gots the car rollin, looks like y'all say I'm cold
Still ? watch my currency unfold, 
i think you ridin long seven dayz at the creek,
Bling tatted on my arm how we flip it ? we greet
Never brag never boast, fly'n coast to coastsmokin dank sippin drank 
eat'n scrambled eggs and toast
Chingale my padre,bought a Lexus for my madre
red bubble lense smoking swishas on the highway
parking on the sand, jumping up outta the van
Byzantine around my neck diamonds glistenin on my hand
watch i spin heads with my cranberry red 
remote controlled vcr stretch burban with beddouble stretch limosuine
twenty inch byzantine
i live my life a ballin' hustla could it all be a dream,
Exotic beaches and peaches, white tigers on leashes
we gonna shine on our way to the lane the speed on our Lexus increases
in this game on a mission light it up expedition, 
you ain't gotta be all up in my face
I blind you hoes from a distance, 
chandeliers in my den, blowin' smoke in the wind 
you can catch me in my 600 or the big body benz

Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall
Ridin blowin big sippin on a daily basis
Quick to hop by on your block and wreck faces
Slammin door's open spaces looking good standing tall
Beatin Down ya block knockin pictures off the wall
