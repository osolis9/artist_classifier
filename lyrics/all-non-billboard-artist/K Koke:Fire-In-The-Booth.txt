Fire-In-The-Booth:K Koke
Whether you're in HMV or KFC, HMP or A&E;
I make them see A.N.D let you know the C.A.S.E
From LDN not NYC, on the M.I.C, Im M.I.B
Like BIG the MVP, VIP to the E.N.D
EG my CD, is way to D.E.E.P
That goes for your TV screen, DVD or BBC
ITN or ITV, C.O.P say ID please
S.T.O.P like IC3, wanna see me hooked to an I.V G
In the ICU but Im N.O.T, they went O.T with the M.O.B
Can't see me through the F.O.G
Don't cuss mothers of S.O.B's
These MCs are OAPs,
wanna hype up I'm like OK, G
You think you're B.A.D,
Get a P.E.N and a P.A.D
If the CIA and the FBI, the MI6 and the MI5
Get on the A3 then I drive, turn up the A/C, FYI
MJ like P.Y.T, LOL I never T.Y.P
I E.A.T on E.I.D, twist the C.I.D like Levi Jeans
D.I.E like BNP; EDL just BFGs
Youths don't want no GCSE's they want C.O.D on the PS3
Im like DP or PE, or KRS from BDP
Download this on your MP3
send it to your MP & MTV
You're not on this thing like A.D.D
Your CD i rate PG
Like KKK's with AK's
My A.K.A is AA
Take you off the road ASAP
DDT these JLS MC's
What you just saw basically,
is how to murder the ABC
Cos Im back in the booth
rappers wanna chat about the strap they got stashed in the back of their boot
But I chat to the youths
Abstract or backpack my attributes and stack to the roof
I capture the truth
Pour it on tracks my view and I'll sell it out the back of the boot
Im positive you're negative, you're whack and confused
Im back and the fact is your dad's in the room
Ain't a track that you rappers can battle with
everytrack that I spat is immaculate
any track that I smash Im attacking it
Heard you rap fam, your tracks are inadequate
Your CD was kak, it was crap, Im dashing it
You follow fashion with rap, Im passionate
