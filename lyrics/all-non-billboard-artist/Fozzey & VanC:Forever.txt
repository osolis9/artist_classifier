Forever:Fozzey & VanC
I've seen 'em come and go, 
both in music and life.
I've seen dreams fall to pieces, 
I've seen funerals live.
I've seen talented people, 
grow accustomed to death.
'Till their talent is nothing, 
shit I'm one of them now.
Went along for direction, 
I just honour this lesson.
This music shit is like ya life, 
could be gone in a second.
So while your here, 
what piece of mind are you leaving for your own child to believe in?
What kind of life are you leading?
Do you want that, 
lifestyle of the rich and famous?
I tried to be instantaneous, 
true that, 
when I list the greatest.
Who that, 
my descriptions nameless.
But now that I got some perspective, 
I'm scared to death of death.
Ain't no-one to lift you up, 
or to bring you back 
or to resurrect.
So if I die tomorrow, 
while I'm floating away,
I just wanna leave something behind 
as a token of faith.
So take these words, 
take this song, 
take this verse.
Now let's sing this part together,
and let's make this last forever, 
come on.

Look how hard I've worked, 
just to get here now.
There's so many people in my past 
that have let me down.
Never listened to a hater, 
never gave it away.
You all just fueled my fire, 
I sat here slaving away.
I'm so hungry for success, 
I'm gettin' hunger pains.
Fightin' off my fake friends,
like the hunger games.
Finally got an opportunity,
let's make the most.
I ain't making bread, 
but let's make a toast.
I've walked so many paths, 
chose the one I'm on.
I wanna thank my parents, 
I'm blessed to be your son.
So many people in my life just came 
and they went.
And I've got very few people 
that I call my friends.
So if I die tomorrow, 
while I'm floating away,
I just wanna leave something behind 
as a token of faith.
So take these words, 
take this song, 
take this verse.
Now let's sing this part together,
and let's make this last forever, 
come on.
