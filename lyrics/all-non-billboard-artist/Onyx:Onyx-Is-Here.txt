Yeah, yeah yeah make way for the wild child
Stop screamin', you're fiendin'
Play that, say that, dip dive socialize
Uncivilized guys rise up

And pop wasn't ready the way they say this 'cause we hate it
Back up, back off, lick shot for that tree spot
Onyx is the antidote for all your problems
Damn! Don't it feel good

Yo, I know you love to hate it, but you cannot explain
Why you keep puttin' Mad Face in your veins
Oooh, yeah, there, I got it
Afficial Nastee psychotic, spies got spotted
So travel through the mind of a maniac automatic
You panic get deaded, a nigga on the planet
Feel the black stone, hit the do', roamin' the [Incomprehensible]
Fills and skills to put chills in ya backbone

1 to the 9 to the 9 to the 3, solid as a rock
So back up off the block, blow up the spot
So left, right, left, right take it to the center, and enter
The black reign domain, a plain you never been to
And you know what this is, what, face down on the floor
Give me it all, I got they back against the wall

Don't be afraid, you'll only lose your life that way
I'm an endangered species, surprised to live to see today
But if you're readin' between the enemy line you'll find I'm insane
Too much strain on the brain, capable to pop a vein
So I'ma do it, do it, do it, do it, do it like this
The Onyx is here, so back up or get dissed
And if you put me to the test, I'll lay you to rest
Bring it right to his chest, put it straight through his vest

Move back the Onyx is here
