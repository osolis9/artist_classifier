I like em' brown, yellow, Porto Rican or Haitian
Slim, thin waist with a beautiful face and
Yeah, you know though you got the monolog
Timbs on, yes headstrong rollin for dollo

I see you in the summer time wearing capris
Looking so good it feel like a 100 degrees
Mami please, I need me a chick to stay down
Hittin' so many cities, they call me greyhound

I'm searchin' for the finest, the type of girl that's rough
But still a diamond, tastes like Phyllis Haimand
I'm looking for a mami, a girl that'll chill and discuss
And play the cut, don't be sayin' too much

But I'm not consuming them, some say that I'm booin' them
But 20 cent do, I'm known for baggin' two of them
That's how we doin them, it aint hard to tell
You need to holla at the boyz called ATL

Callin' all girls, all around the world
We wanna get to know you

Callin' all girls, all around the world
We just wanna' love you
(We just wanna' love you)
