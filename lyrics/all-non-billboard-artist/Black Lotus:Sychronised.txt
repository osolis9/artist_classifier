Verse 1:
I'm out of touch,
Out of time,
Chasing a goal
That isn't mine.

No one can run,
To a steady beat,
Sooner or later,
You loose your feet.

A change in pulse,
A rhythmic  shift,
Out of pace
I slowely drift.

You can't follow a beat,
That isn't yours,
Every system 
Has its flaws.

Chorus:
Work all day,
Sleep all night,
Ticking hands
Control your life.

Keep in time,
Keep the pace,
You can try
Don't loose the race.

Verse 2:
I fall behind,
Losing the race,
I get back up
And try to chase.

If i try,
To slow it down,
The beat is lost
I slowly drown.

A fatal flaw,
I trip upon,
Battered now
I can't go on.

Focus lost,
Head caves in,
Pain lurks deep
Within my skin

Verse 3:
Around the world,
The beat goes on,
Synchronised
Just like this song.

Check your step,
Keep on going,
Even though
The pain is showing.
