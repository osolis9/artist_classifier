Hate:Kyprios
Do you know what I am? I am a nigger. 

That's right the tip of my ebony pole rests between my knees so they don't knock together when I sleep on my side at night. I'm well hung like a grand wizard hanging from a telephone pole in the ghetto, because you know there's no trees in the ghetto. Know what I'm sayin'? They say these fat robust lips can barely articulate the miniscule thoughts in my tiny brain but I can rap my fuckin' ass off. Know what I'm sayin'? They say my life's as lazy as my tongue is and know what I'm sayin' is a conjunction I use when I don't know what I'm saying or got nothing else to say. Know what I'm sayin'? 

And I am a nigger. Do you know what I hate? I hate whitey. Liberalistic, masochistic, conservative, preservative republican so love my skin - Fuck the democratics who give me my automatics and the aristocratic autonomy who see the melanin in me as a felony, one to three for thievery nigga they callin' me, but what the fuck did you get when you stole the whole native colony? Oh you were the lawyers and the judges you read the Tom Sawyers and the Huck Finn's, hate me, segregate me, threaten to kick me out of the country, but who stole me the fuck in? Fuck skin? I don't see any black on your green to me it's white dollars, ten to life = six months to three years if you got them white collars. America - land of the jailed, home of the slave. I hate whitey.

Do you know what I am? I'm a whitey. Do you know what I hate? I hate those chinks. They can only have one child in their country so they come to my country and have fifteen kids so they can take over, it√¢
