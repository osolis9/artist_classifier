We definition representin' what is Doap?
What is hope when ya faith get tested?
Yeah, what is coke when da weight ain't stretchin'?
Yeah, what is hate when da hatin' ain't affectin'?
A buncha mad niggas we comin' for mad figgaz
That upset money, that coke and wet money
That Frank Lucas buried under da steps money
This official like a breath wit a whistle
I'm from where young bulls can't read but day rep wit day pistols
Yeah, respect is a issue but neva wit mines
Y'all funkies get away da shit but neva wit crimes
Stick not like a pregnant john
I'm finna wreck this john (show 'em)

Yeah, I'm on their heels Reef, yo, let's go

Yo, y'all niggas is average learnin' to crawl
Producers is mad ass, we don't return ya calls
Ya emails get deleted so beat it
Ya helps is not needed, Knowledge itself completes it
Divine cipher power slit in this game nice
Signed a deal burnt my advance on da same night
(Let's go) This game so foul, so many cats
So many petty labels, so many traps
Ya moms shoulda put you in a school to clean clothes
Dudes ova here hit gold wit mean flows
I'm in a ill Reef stay on da road
Da Pharaohs doing shows, I got that yay on da stove
My whole life felt like I'm stuck at a stoplight
But seein' how da hustlaz got that money to wash right
Me and Reef came from da nights we slang white
To spittin' out Bangkok rippin' da same mic

Yeah, ain't nobody fuckin' wit da .38 on my waist
And when that bulldog bark it'll lay you to waste
I ain't fuckin' around wit ya, y'all need to stay in ya place
And da vest ain't gonna help you God I aim at da face
Y'all ain't doin' shit original fam
And my gun is da same color as The Original Man
I caught a body and I put da shit to digital cam
That shit you makin' ain't a hit it's just a pitiful jam
Yeah, ayo Doap cuzin' hit 'em wit da .40 glock
Make his body levitate and he can do a dome wit 'Pac
Y'all mothafuckaz should just take this as a warnin' shot
I'm bout to celebrate, I heard about da fallin' cop
Y'all think y'all could fuck wit Paz and it's not hardly
I put your name in da obituary - John Tardy
My whole cipha should be dreaded like we Bob Marley
And it ain't anotha human thats Master Farad Godly
