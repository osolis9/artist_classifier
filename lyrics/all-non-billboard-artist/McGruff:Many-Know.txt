Many-Know:McGruff
Come on, hit 'em phat, what?
Come on, just like that yo yo

I sip on X-O, collect dough, leave your whole block wetto
Bust out my glock gecko, got you petro hold your heart and don't let go
Meet your doom as soon as that heat go boom, gun slinga
Rely only on one finger, the one that's itchie your son hit me
I want my gun wit me they got Harlem world like gun city

Y'all know who dumb gritty, y'all know who come wit the glicky
For fun strictly, front you'll get stung quickly
Pistol whipped up you know what's next if you get up
I did it in what mapped the join an' hid in the cut
An' after that black slid wit yo slut an nigga what

Many niggas know that we be fly
Harlem world baby do or die
Swimmin' in tha chocha we be high
Niggas can't see us so why try?

Yo aiyo Gruff hot, CD sell like drug spot
Mouth weedy smell, eyes blood shot
Buc pop look at feds takin' mug shots
Real niggas move swift na ta duck cops

You know how we go, play tha lelo in Montego Bay
Puff dro head all day moet all day, sweat all day
Ain't nothin' changed still got my ghetto ways
I'ma be gruff even when I'm dead or gray
Do my thing in hip-hop get this bread off yay

Keep my wolves wit me might have ta let off spray

Yo, money when you get some evil

Cats don't learn frontin' and there gat don't burn
You talkin' myth stylin' wit a big fo fifth
Son yo, soft and never did your gun go off
Keep it real for all my guns up north
Gruff Lenox, Harlem world 139 fuckin' Lenox

Buck relentless till they put me up in bentess
Funeral home squeeze put two in your dome
Ever since I was young, I was influenced wit chrome
Now I smoke haze, reminisce of broke days

Sippin' on that old lemon twist and Roseay's
Get publishin' screw when the coke raise
Use to ball keys, now I collect raw tee's, what nigga?
