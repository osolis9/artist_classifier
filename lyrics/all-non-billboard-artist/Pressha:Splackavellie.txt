Splackavellie:Pressha
Intro
You know there comes a period in every womans life,
when she gets frustrated and fed up, with her man and
all his silly hang ups. You know a woman wants a man
she don't have to have no drama behind you, just
somebody who can love her down with no strings attached,
and his name is Splackavellie

verse 1
Tell me what kind of superman, would take you to his
bedroom baby, and hit you wit some front back and side to side.
Like hydraulics on a stormy nite and break you off something proper like.
Ain't no need for you to to perpetrate 'cuz u will accommodate and you will appreciate
the way he flips you up, down and round and round, in and out make you scream and
shout."shorty put your thing down down"

Bridge:
He ain't your boyfriend, he ain't your husband just somebody you can call
when your body needs a fix, he'll put you in the mix, then you'll hear him
asking whats my name, say my name Splackavellie.

Chorus:
Every woman needs her own Splackavellie, a brother
she can call when her man ain't doin her right.
He can work it all night.
Until the morning light, make her feel right right right.
Every woman needs that one Splackavellie, a brother
she can call when her man ain't doin her right.
He can work it all night.
Until the morning light, make her feel right right right

verse 2:
Tell me what kind of superman, would make you feel
good with his mouth, and kiss you from your earring to your
belly chain, and then go down a lil' further mane.

Drop the top on his Mercedes Benz, so her legs can
feel the wind as he hits it again and again and again and again.
