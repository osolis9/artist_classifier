Human-Error-Outro-:Horrorshow
[Solo]

Who's world is this? To tell you the truth I'm not sure
Feeling more and more like we fighting for a lost cause
My jaw drops as I watch on the box
See the planes shot out of the sky and wonder what for
We can do better, now more than ever
Hear the cries out in Tahrir Square, we want more
But there's war going on across the seas
Blood flowing in the streets over power and greed
I guess it's just human nature tryna intervene
Gaza Strip, Auschwitz, Kosovo, Hiroshima
I picture these moments like 'what if it was me?'
But I'm home safe and sounds just watching it on the screen
Stuck between a horror movie and a Disney scene
Right and wrong and everything in between
So I write these songs my therapy's in these beats
When the mic is on my enemies see defeat, but
Time ticks on and everything will repeat
What a wise man once said to me
My reply was needless, still I kept gathering the pieces
To help me as I'm writing out my thesis
On the most curious of creatures, students and teachers
Sinners and preachers, tycoons and street sweepers
Engineers in hard hats, presidents and ministers
Made from the very same bone, flesh and ligaments
Crooks and thieves, in pursuit of some crooked beliefs
Who do some things that you wouldn't believe
Thought about it too long, what I wouldn't achieve
Now I rock-a-bye a baby tryna put em to sleep
I had a subway conversation with an angel who had killed a man
Explained to me that we're each part of a bigger plan
We sat and kicked it, he talked and I listened
Tryna soak up his wisdom in that instant
I understood this twisted system
We all so complicit in it
Just components in the same mechanism
Each taking turns playing out the rhythm
Don't know any different though we never gave permission
Ain't a lot on this rock I can call my own
But the space around my head is a no-fly zone
In this cold barren land that I call my home
A king amongst many's waiting on a throne
