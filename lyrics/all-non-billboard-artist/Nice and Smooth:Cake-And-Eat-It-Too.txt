Cake-And-Eat-It-Too:Nice and Smooth
You can't have your cake and eat it too, girl
'Cause I guess that two loves just won't do, girl
You say you wanna love this new girl
Between me and him you've got to choose, girl

I've spent most my life, searchin' for those true
And when we first met I thought that girl was you
Your beauty captured me, right there from the start
But how was I to know that today you'd break my heart?

You can't have your cake and eat it too, girl
'Cause I guess that two loves just won't do, girl
You say you wanna love this new girl
Between me and him you've got to choose, girl

I bought you Fendi, Louis', diamond rings
Mink jackets all the fly material things
Thought you were mine, from the heaven above
But I see another knucklehead sharin' my love

I thought you were the lock and I, had the key
My personal jewel, my life's entity
But I see, you're now for Greg N I C E and

You can't have your cake and eat it too, girl
'Cause I guess that two loves just won't do, girl
You say you wanna love this new girl
Between me and him you've got to choose, girl

Say you want freedom and respect
Never tied you down, no need to check
But you called me up, wishin' to explain
How your man has a car no need for a train

Then you see me with my brand new girl
Eyes like emeralds, teeth like pearls
Put a frown on your face and you act all rash
Wanna pull her hair and face you wanna bash

You can't have your cake and eat it too, girl
'Cause I guess that two loves just won't do, girl
You say you wanna love this new girl
Between me and him you've got to choose, girl
