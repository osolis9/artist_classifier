High-Tymes:Quez
(Verse)
I got a homie named Janet, say she never hit the weed
Well that’s kinda crazy to me cuz I’m in love with the trees
I got gas and I’m puffin sour D’s
Got some cookie in the back and some triple OG
Nigga please, I got whatever that you want
I’mma teach you how to roll it, grab a paper roll blunt
You can hit out a bong if it take too long
She hit the weed and now she coughin
Hold up with my phone lil mama
Geekin, and her eyes red
And now she gaspin for some air, she bout to drop dead
And now I kick it with lil mama every Friday
We just roll em back to back, we just some potheads, potheads

(Hook)
I’m high, it ain’t nothing that can bring me down
We bustin swishas and we rollin out the pound
We keep them bad bitches and you never ever round, round
But we high, it ain’t nothing that can bring us down
Look at them niggas that I hang around
Light up the swisha, let that thing go around, round
Now we high

(Verse)
Now let me tell you bout my potna man
He always round the weed but he don’t never hit the product
He caught a couple cases, now that nigga on probation
And I feel bad for him
Cuz he can’t taste the shit I’m tastin
Got people thinkin we jamaican
But we got some pretty bitches waitin
And they all wanna is fuckin smoke
So we gon let em spend the night so in the morning eggs & bacon
I’m that nigga, young, rich, famous
I got bitches, actresses, models, strippers & singers
You can hit em, you know I show love
Give me a swisha, I’m tryna roll up
