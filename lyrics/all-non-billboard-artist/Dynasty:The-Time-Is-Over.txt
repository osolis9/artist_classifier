The-Time-Is-Over:Dynasty
What am I going to do now?
If I don´t have where to go
It´s so dark outside
And I´m afraid to go out

Looking at the time going by
(Will there be time for me)
Oh! My time is over

The life I had in the past
Did nothing for me
I was trapped in my addictions
But the dose is over

Oh, No! My veins can get no more
(My blood has finished)
So much poison I put in myself

I raised my hands
Waiting for someone
Who can help me
Where am I?
How many dose have I injected?
For my own end

Looking at the time going by
(Will there be time for me)
So much poison I put in myself
