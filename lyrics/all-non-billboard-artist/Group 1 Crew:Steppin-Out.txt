Steppin-Out:Group 1 Crew
I feel called to something more,
beyond what I have known.
I keep shutting out that voice
that cries deep within my soul.
I have more to give, but I have been afraid.
And then I hear You say, "It's still not too late.."

I'm stepping out to take a chance.
And if I fly or if I fall it's in Your hands.
You're the maker of my dreams,
and You'll make a way with me.
So I'm stepping out, I'm stepping out...
To take a chance (Woah oh oh oh oooh)
To take a chance (Woah oh oh oh oooh)

I'm alive, I want to live...
And I am not content to keep holding
back all that I am, the way that I have been.
I am Yours to use.
And when I am afraid, You come close to say, "1 step it all it takes...".

I'm stepping out to take a chance.
And if I fly or if I fall it's in Your hands.
You're the maker of my dreams(maker of my dreams)
,and You'll make a way with me.
So I'm stepping out, I'm stepping out...

I believe in the grace You've shown me.
I believe in the words You say.
I believe there's an untold story,
that You're telling through me.
