Porno-Muzik:Max B
Verse 1:
Baby i can get in ya mind
I can make you never love another bitch
Smoke the haze to soothe yo' mind
I'm stressin' won't you come and get this dick
I doggystyle then she oww oww oww
She likes to get wild, she likes to get down down down
Said she love it when I'm fuckin' it, on top of the cover and
Beat it like a quarter key, paper she don't lovin' it
Gotta nigga lovin' it, skeet it in ya face bitch
Grip me by the balls, I need you to come and taste this
He do with no spaceships, floatin' through the city
I'll be focused on ya titty while we bouth be lookin' pretty
Lemme focus on ya kitty, Bigga do it ri-ight
All I'm tryna do is spend the ni-ight
Leave we gon' be puttin' up a fi-ight
Got them Louis bags on the fli-ight
Time to say goodbye-yiy

Chorus:
So just come give it to a nigga girl
Lemme see ya lil' light twirl
And then she say why she a freak
Naw, I heard she was a very nice girl
I heard she cool, heard she even went to school
Heard she friends with some nice white girls
My baby splurge, I like the way she work it
So baby I hope you like my world

Verse 2:
Now I'm ballin' on some other shit
Everywhere we go keep them sweeters on some other shit
Heaters on that mothership
Damn a nigga real, won't you come make love to me
Won't you come break off in me, don't you wanna fuck with me
Nigga gimme that, ride him and that Benz, me and Mini Max
Put you on ya piggyback, play ya in some pitty-pat
Baby come and get it, won't you taste it and come lick it
Got a nigga screamin' ay-yay, we fuck everyday-yay
We fuck when it's payday, mayday
Maxy B, I can give a fuck about what you gave me, played me
I ain't havin' nuttin', you's a faggot, plus you stuntin'
Cop that baggage kuz it's nuffin', I'm established
I can puff it on the average, I got suttin'
Bigga, he don't play-yay
Baby I'm just tryna know ya na-ame
All them other niggaz is so la-ame
All they wanna do is lip-si-ing, I'm about to si-ing

Chorus:
So just come give it to a nigga girl
Lemme see ya lil' light twirl
And then she say why she a freak
Naw, I heard she was a very nice girl
I heard she cool, heard she even went to school
Heard she friends with some nice white girls
My baby splurge, I like the way she work it
So baby I hope you like my world
