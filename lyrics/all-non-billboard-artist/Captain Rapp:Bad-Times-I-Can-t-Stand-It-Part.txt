Bad-Times-I-Can-t-Stand-It-Part:Captain Rapp
Yes, even the bad times are good
If there's a chance
That your heart misses
The words I try to say with kisses
If I don't seem to look
As happy as I should
I wouldn't want to live without you
I love everything about you
Yes even the bad times are good
Your middle name should be perfection
'Cause that's what you are to me
Even in my darkest moments
You made it easier to see
I wouldn't change one thing about you
If I knew that I could
Yes, even the bad times are good
(Yes, even the bad times are good)
You never let me feel mistreated
Your love is all I ever needed
When I was weak somehow
You always understood
You're not afraid of stormy weather
And that's what keeps our love together
Yes, even the bad times are good
Your middle name
