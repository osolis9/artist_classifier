Summer-Fling:Willow Smith
The Bright Sun And The Blue Water...
We Fight Less And Love Harder...
You Tell Me That I'm The One...
I Tell You It's Just For Fun...
We Walk The Beach At Midnight...
And Watch The Stars In The Clear Skies...
We Both Say I Love You...
But it's Alright...

[Willow Talking...]

The bright sun and the blue water, we fight less and love harder.
You tell me that I'm the one, I tell you it's just for fun.

We walk the beach at midnight, and watch the stars in the clear skies. We
both say I love you, but it's alright.

I write you a song, you play your guitar
You and me, both sing along and hold hands for too long.
If you wanna talk I guess that's alright, If you wanna walk under the night
sky, I don't really care cause we got tonight oh baby...
