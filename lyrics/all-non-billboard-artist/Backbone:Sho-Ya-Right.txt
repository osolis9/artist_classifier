Sho-Ya-Right:Backbone
Hey, hey, stay sharp as fuck
Tell 'em, get that right and straighten that up
Fat Face, the man of hundred grand
Work the mic with precise precision, knahmsayin'?

At 36, on the bean, come clean
I'll bring you the whole thing for 18
They look to Back for the word on the street
You see him smilin', count eight gold teeth

You see it, he keep the brim broke slightly
Killin' 'em with the one that roll tightly
Floppin' in the M-6 deuce
The A-T go and then he do too

Baby, I tell it like it T I S
I'll stand right here and sho' stop ya career
Call him, H2O, ice-cold water
Just like that there, in that particular order

Uhh, school these young Gs on the concrete
Fall off and be back on in one week
He keep his clothes crease crisp out the cleaners
Did court subpoenas on some simple misdemeanors

They ain't got nothin' on me
'Cuz he threw my light right not to be
Wham, uhh, wham, see 'em hittin' me
Y'all hold it down, I'll be back through here in a minute

(Sho ya right)
We serve it raw or ready to chop

You get every damn gram straight dropped

Cook chickens, no sizzle, no pop
(Sho ya right)
Or better, when you ready to shop
(Sho ya right)

We old school, walk the dog out the yard
We play the curse, serve it hard on the 'vard
You know the number 'fore ya even went seen shorty
The automatic beast, keep him off me

Shit, holla at me, y'all know ya know me
Ya drunk with them 1600 DSOPs
(Be dat)
We bake bread by the loaf
Smoke ya dro down to a roach

Let 'em know, this here, fisher from the do'
Ya already know, exactly how it goes
SWAT's in trees, DF one G, da pure emcee
What's happenin'? What's happenin'? What's happenin'?

Organ No-I-Z, keep ya motherf*** trunk valid
Tell 'em, it's goin' down this evening
Keep it jumpin' like Sunday, go to meeting
Uh, uh, it don't stop, it don't quit
It get down to the nitty-grit

That brand new out the box
I ain't in them, swear to make 'em call the cops
I walk a path, play the cut, lil' girl shake her butt
Ay, ay, ay, now party people, if ya wit me, say
