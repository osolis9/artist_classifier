Money-Party-feat-Polly-A-:Kat Dahlia
Yeah we on the rooftop
Party everyday
Red stripe, tube socks
That’s my man Jose
And he smoke the mota
I told him pass it this a way
He got a girl he knocked up
She don’t let him come out and play

We got the beans, got the leans for the theme
It’s a good party, yeah
We never sleep, we just run from the dream
It’s a good party yeah yeah yeah

What goes to clouds one life we got
Roof caving in, we are bound to drop
Put the worries down, drop it like it’s hot
Show me the money, money, money,
Wanna party party party
Three shots in, not one regret
Looking out my one, till it fills again
Got a cutie in my face asking have we met
I got the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party

Zoned out head knocks,
Looking like it to break.
Boombox spittin' 2Pac
He was so damn sexy.
I wish I had his number
‘Cause all these dudes are the same
They sniffin' out for the tuna
They want that fish fillet

We got the beans, got the leans for the theme
It’s a good party, yeah
We never sleep, we just run from the dream
It’s a good party yeah yeah yeah

What goes to clouds one life we got
Roof caving in, we are bound to drop
Put the worries down, drop it like it’s hot
Show me the money, money, money,
Wanna party party party
Three shots in, not one regret
Looking out my one, till it fills again
Got a cutie in my face asking have we met

Little green dragons I just took a shot of acid
With baby by the pool, Dammit that should really happen
I can’t take it,
Think my face just failed
My body just got on a plane
[?] Leslie took my name
And I'm try to get it back,
But can’t remember wasn't thinking
Party’s in the corner tryna hit on Kirko Bangz
And Bobby’s telling me that when music hits you feel no
Pain

What goes to clouds one life we got
Roof caving in, we are bound to drop
Put the worries down, drop it like it’s hot
Show me the money, money, money,
Wanna party party party
Three shots in, not one regret
Looking out my one, till it fills again
Got a cutie in my face asking have we met?
I got the money, money, money
Wanna party, party, party
