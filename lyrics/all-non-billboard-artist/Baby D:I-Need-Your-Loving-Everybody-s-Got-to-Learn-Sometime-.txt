Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan
Ooh I Like Your Loving
I refuse to be amused
That's sumthin' that ain't right

Chorus

I can feel this fire
Such a strange desire
As strong as life itself

No i'm not stallin'
I'm justa doin' sumthin' else
When we're together

Right now i'm by myself
And i...

Repeat chorus
