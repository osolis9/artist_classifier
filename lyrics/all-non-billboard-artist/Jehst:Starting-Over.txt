Starting-Over:Jehst
I'm a wasteman I'm a loner
I'm a spaceman, I'm a stoner
It's that fresh cut grass aroma
Midnight toker spark the doja

I'm a brave man, I'm a soldier
I'm a caveman with a boner
You be marge and I'll be homer
Can't we just try starting over?

Starting over [x7]

In the bathroom, walls are moulding
Single glazing let's the cold in
'Cause the paper that I'm folding
Is like wet tissue dissolving

What's the next issue to solve it?
What's the beef that needs resolving?
Who's vexed with you?
Who's conniving?
We'd strangle the plant that's thriving

Bleak outlooks turn dark horizons
Sun's like cigrarette tips burning
We're not any less determined
To lay down poison for the vermin

Now I'm searching for the answer
Even harder, evil laughter
Of self-torment echoes thunder
When I rest my head for slumber

I'm the hunter, I'm the hunted
I'm a mascot for the blunted
Call out anyone who fronted
On how my rent and food is funded

I'm the dude youtube redundant
Don my nuke-proof, bang the drum kit
Halloween rock smash your pumpkins
City boy slash country bumpkin

I'm a wasteman I'm a loner
I'm a spaceman, I'm a stoner
It's that fresh cut grass aroma
Midnight toker spark the doja

I'm a brave man, I'm a soldier
I'm a caveman with a boner
You be marge and I'll be homer
Can't we just try starting over?
