Purpose:Deep Puddle Dynamics
I tippy toe across your dream at night
So as not to wake you

Odd mannerisms, strictly cultured
With a compilation, contorted jigsaw puzzle
These shoes were made to tip toe through and leave a mark
This is the starting point for all my future works

Before deep puddle, I was a bead of inspiration
Now I get an iceberg, slim human piano slash orchestra
Playing myself for all my favorite enemas
Everything cons, study and minuscule minds
Take the time to be a better part

I tippy toe across your dream at night
So as not to wake you

That voice, that voice is my constant awakening on the hour
Every hour, I spring to a 90 degree angle in a cold sweat
Returning to that not so comfortable self esteem, it's next to nothing
Non existent security surrounds my soul

And makes me think more about my self worth
I splash water on my face to try and wash away my disconnections
This infection is killing me slowly
Slip back in my slumber only to hear it once again

I tippy toe across your dream at night
So as not to wake you

Awoken to self, chokin' a bad dream
No vaccine but to stare and breathe the air
Vision the pattern to listen to my woes
And I suppose to burst reaction 'til the thirst for answers

Lanterns and light bulbs, cycles to cover
The odors of lost lovers' aromas
Hang loose like the coma induced
Produce seduction and found my true function

I tippy toe across your dream at night
So as not to wake you

Multiple personalities, a four headed beast
Caught in between a brief freedom release
As lost as your cause, walking through water and walls
Until we crash and dissolve and martyr our flaws

It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time
It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time
It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time
It ain't all love, it's confusion and a waste of time

It ain't all time, it's confusion and a waste of love
It ain't all waste, it's confusion and some time to love
It ain't all confusion, it's love and some time to waste

It ain't all that, it's all of the above
So scared into this and you are
And you wonder from the shores how deep the puddle is
Wet
