Paratrooper:Pillar
Equipment check we hit the ground runnin
Clocks synced we know the times coming
Behind enemy lines where the fight lies
Be at the ready keep your eyes set on the prize
And realize that the battle that you face now
Ain't about an enemy you gotta chase down
Face down rendezvous you better know now
that the fights coming to you
So watchya do now gotta find your platoon
Cause we'll be waiting at the rally point ready to move
Moving with a purpose like there’s something to prove
No excuse we press on we got work to do

1,2,3,4 
Everybody put your hands in the sky
1,2,3,4 
Stepping into battle with our heads held high

We’re dropping from the sky like soldiers in the night
With cover of the light, its do or die
No soldier left behind together side by side
And we will face this fight its do or die

Locked and cocked our weapons at the ready now
We don’t stop we gotta keep it steady now
Pressing on with a purpose like there’s nothing to lose
Don’t stop moving we got something to prove
This time we know what we’re fighting for
Like Jimmy Braddock coming back for more
We know that we’re stronger than we were before
Got an army at our six here to settle the score

1,2,3,4 
Everybody put your hands in the sky
1,2,3,4 
Stepping into battle with our heads held high

We’re dropping from the sky like soldiers in the night
With cover of the light, its do or die
No soldier left behind together side by side
And we will face this fight its do or die

And we will fight
Dropping from the sky

We’re dropping from the sky like soldiers in the night
With cover of the light
We’re dropping from the sky like soldiers in the night
With cover of the light, its do or die

No soldier left behind together side by side
And we will face this fight its do or die
