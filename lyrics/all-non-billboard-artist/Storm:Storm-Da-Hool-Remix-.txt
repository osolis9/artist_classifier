Storm-Da-Hool-Remix-:Storm
Blowing so strongly, the storm makes a point
It brings along odor that will make you faint
Stench of the dead on the theater of war
Has not let nobody be carefree so far

Fight for salvation has lasted a while
And looks like it carries on for a long time
Killing the warriors who came here for glory
Lets hope someone lives through to retell the story

Fear has no power
All spirits are high
If death runs us over
No need for good bye

Grim reaper old-timer
Will gather our souls
A lifetime is over
Earth takes back the bones

A battle is held between rivaling tribes
For honor and fortune have men left their wives
Lust for destruction has confused their minds
Changed into monsters they don't want to be

The struggle is even and no one can tell
A figure of saying for whom the bell tolls
No one has come here to let themselves die
A side of the winners is the ultimate goal

Fear has no power
All spirits are high
If death runs us over
No need for good bye

Grim reaper old-timer
Will gather our souls
A lifetime is over
Earth takes back the bones

Fear has no power
All spirits are high
If death runs us over
No need for good bye

Grim reaper old-timer
Will gather our souls
A lifetime is over
Earth takes back the bones
