Comptown-Stocktown:Infinite Mass
Westside, in the house for the nineteen ninety sick
Yeah, Mc Eiht in the house, Infinite Mass in the house
And this is how we represent, check it out

We represent from six thousand miles away
We get our slang on, bang on, hang to the A.K.
You don't wanna play, say what you say
What the Westside puts it down all day

Handle mine with the nine-mill
Clocking bills on the westside of the hill
Ain't nothing change but the scrilla
You don't work, you don't eat
So I'm nothing but the killa

Keep on sweating this Compton thang
Eiht Da Mack come strap and high jack the damn plane
Floating like hawking birds
You gets dub by this criminal nigga on the run

We bangs like Crips and Bloods
Straight thugs from Compton to Stocktown
Killing and drugs
It don't matter where you at gee

From under the fifty night to Rinkeby
We holds it down, E and the Infinite
Bought it twenty million crowns
One two, one two, check it out

We represent from Comptown 2 Stocktown
From block to block, glocks to glocks, all around

For the ones who's down with the Eiht hype sound
From block to block to da last busstop in your town
I don't mean to brag but we've gots that shit
Make weak rappers stand still while we be spitting out hits

Fools get killed everyday and peace they may West
'Cause Infinite Mass and MC Eiht is like 2 to the chest
That's real, that's how I feel, I gots to be hard
'Cause the world is hard, I'm glad I'm live, that's why I thank God

Standing here in the middle of nowhere
My mind is tripping on me 'cause butter's gone there
What should I do? I'm stronger than I thought
Got my peeps together and say, let's do it from the heart

Years went by, my click got tight
Pimps and hustlers on the late night hype
On the next level that no one can fear

Fools be sayin' gees be weak while my block not
Just squeete my homie Shelf with the sock 'round his glock
And that's how we live in the R I N K E B Y
The place I call home in the Stocktown zone

And this is for all the slanging fools
From them one's locked down to them still hanging in the hood
And nothing new, 'cause we been here for years
With the Mass and the Compton Psycho dropping shit in your ears

And every track we makes be banging for the ninety sick
It's from Stocktown and Compton thanging
And a lot of groups out there, the lack with the Mass
Rollin' with record-reppers, checking for fast
