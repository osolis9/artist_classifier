Still-Your-Ghost:Rondo Brothers
(What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back
Into time)

For a while
I was your little doll
You loved me like
I wasn't there at all

'Cause in your eyes
My life seemed very small
And time again I once became a shadow on the wall

Uh huh, uh huh
Ah ah, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Ah ah, uh huh

Uh huh (uh huh), uh huh (uh huh)
Ah ah, uh huh
Uh huh (uh huh), uh huh (uh huh)
Ah ah ah ah ah

And in your arms, you let me fall asleep
I woke up only long enough to dream
The hours spun a web inside of me
To make a million civil lines that show the perfect way to lead

Uh huh, uh huh
Ah ah, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Ah ah, uh huh

Uh huh (uh huh), uh huh (uh huh)
Ah ah, uh huh
Uh huh (uh huh), uh huh (uh huh)
Ah ah ah ah ah

I am living inside your skin
I'm still your ghost, it's me again
It's me again, your little sin
I'm still your ghost, I'm still your ghost

(What we're gonna do right here is go back
Way back, in time)

For a while
I was your little doll
You loved me like

You loved me like

Loved me like

I am living inside your skin
I'm still your ghost, it's me again
It's me again, your little sin
I'm still your ghost, I'm still your ghost

It's me again
It's me again
I'm still your ghost
Your little sin
Your little sin
It's me again
I'm still your ghost
I'm still your ghost

Uh huh, uh huh
Ah ah, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Ah ah, uh huh

Uh huh (uh huh), uh huh (uh huh)
Ah ah, uh huh
Uh huh (uh huh), uh huh (uh huh)
Ah ah ah ah ah
