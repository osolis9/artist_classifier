Why-Is-That-:Mareko
Yeah, a new year, Dawn Raid Entertainment
Mareko the marks man
I just wanna know why these people
Don't wanna see a south Auckland
Fallen angel get back into the grace of god?
Yeah a million questions

Yeah
Why is that? I try to persevere to keep my mind intact
Elevate beyond those times when my life's inside a trap
Why is that? The same people that say your rhymes are phat
Would rather see you lying flat with that knife inside your back
Why is that? A select few are blinded by the cash

The be selling their souls to the devil like Spinal Tap
Why is that? That same select few are quick to sign contracts
And hit the dotted line but forgot to find the facts
Why is that? Ayo it's all the teaching by my dad

Kids who shine you got to aim as stronger like right back
Why is that? Your death was in gods final plans
I miss you pops you talking through me inside this track
Why is that? So why is that I really can't whined it back

And say goodbye properly and extend your final lap
There's infinite rhetorical questions but despite that fact
Ayo, I'm still moving forward, still moving forwards

So why is that every time my minds on track
These minor thangs push me every time I try to stand?
(Man I don't know)
And why is that when my crew recites a track
You smile then talk a lot of smack behind my back?
(And how come?)

And why is that I don't retire rap
And become a teacher lawyer or a fireman?
Why is that? Why is that?
Why is that? Why is that?
Why is that? Why is that?

Why is that? I always get support by the fans
But I'm always double crossed by my fams
Why is that? When I almost have the world inside my hands
Man these towering aspirations they decide to crash
Why is that? My little bro's are now using lines and hash

If I find your stash for reals I'll make you buy it back
'Cause you ain't thug just 'cause you inhale drugs
You think your dope the hardest peeps
I know don't drink or smoke

Why is that? I always hear the same old tired raps
By these super purists in fat laces and designer hats
Why is that? And yo my sub conscience keeps on fighting back
Plus these alcoholic beverages they make it twice as bad

Why is that? It's messed up my mind no longer writes me back
My final draft is probably sitting inside these traps
There's infinite rhetorical questions but despite that fact
Ayo I'm still moving forward, still moving forwards

So why is that every time my minds on track
These minor thangs push me every time I try to stand?
(Man I don't know)
And why is that when my crew recites a track
You smile then talk a lot of smack behind my back?
(And how come?)

And why is that I don't retire rap
And become a teacher lawyer or a fireman?
Why is that? Why is that?
Why is that? Why is that?
Why is that? Why is that?

So why is that every time my minds on track
These minor thangs push me every time I try to stand?
(Man I don't know)
And why is that when my crew recites a track
You smile then talk a lot of smack behind my back?
(And how come?)

And why is that I don't retire rap
And become a teacher lawyer or a fireman?
Why is that? Why is that?
Why is that? Why is that?
Why is that? Why is that?
