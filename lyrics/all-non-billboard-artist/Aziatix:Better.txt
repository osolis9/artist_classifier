You argue and fight,
truth hidden in lies and,
left you broken hearted.
All of the people,
so many reasons,
can we get back
to the days.

No clouds hanging over,
burdens all on my shoulders.
I'll carry it all,
I won't let you fall,
believe me when I say,

Mirror on the wall,
may your reflection praise you
God is good and
that's a fact cuz He made you
and it's sad that
the one you love breaks you
no other option
but to be forever grateful
I got zero in the bank,
transfer me your pain
Im'a shoot you to the sun
for you don't have
to see the rain
none can contest,
everything more nothing less,
no girl you deserve the best

You deserve the best from me,
He don't see
the best that I see,

You deserve better You deserve the best

Let's cut the breaks,
ride swift move on
do it real big
wide range, yukon
roof gone, heads up
we can boost off
space is the limit make
our place amongst a few stars
Bright as the north
I give up everything
for the love,
life is the cost
we can ride down the city,
and I'll reserve the stretch
5 star, sky bar you
deserve the best

No clouds hanging over,
burdens all on my shoulders.
I'll carry it all,
I won't let you fall girl.

You deserve the best from me,
He don't see
the best that I see,

You deserve better You deserve the best

and the day you call for me,
how much I want to show
you how it's gon' be,
it's all for you, all for you

and the day you call my name,
you know that
I'll be on my way,
it's all for you, all for you

You deserve the best from me,
He don't see
the best that I see,

You deserve better You deserve the best

We argue and fight,
truth hidden with lies and,
left you broken hearted
