Run-Nigger:The Last Poets
[Abiodun Oyewole] {*"tick-tock" rhythms occur after first two lines*}
I understand that time is running out.
I understand that time, is running out...
I understand that time is running out, I understand that time is running out.
Running out as hastily as niggers run from the Man.
Time is running out, on our natural habits
Time is running out, on lifeless serpents reigning over a living kingdom
Time is running out of talks, marches, tunes, chants, and all kinds of prayers
Time, is running out of time
Heard someone say, "Things were chaaaaaanging" (Changing - things are changing!)
Change, CHAN-CHAN-CHAN-CHANGINNNNNG... from brown to black
Time is running out on bullshit changes
Running out like a bushfire in a dry forest
Like a murder from the scene of a crime
Like a little roach from DDT
Running out like big niggers, running a football field - RUN NIGGER!
Screwing your woman (RUN NIGGERS!)
Whooping your ass (RUN NIGGERS!)
Stealing your culture (RUN NIGGERS!)
Taking your life (RUN NIGGERS!)
Killing your children (RUN NIGGERS!)
RUN NIGGER! - RUN like you run, when the liquor store's closing at Saturday night
Run nigger, cause time is running
Run like time never yielding or forgiving
Moving forward, in a direct pattern of percussive movement
Never warning or relinquinshing
Time, is running running running RUNNING RUNNING RUNNING
