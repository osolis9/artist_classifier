She-Knows:Joyner Lucas
I got a girl she dope as hell
She with that gucci that loiue shanel
Shwaty so right you can't even deny
Booty so fat you can see from the sky
I'm just a guy, I'm just a man
Lot of things bout me she won't understand
I think I'm so used to being alone
Now I got urges to cheat on her low
No it ain't cool
No it ain't nice
No I aint saying that shit is alright
But it was only supposed to be once
Now I got more than one chick on the side
Feel like a dick, feel like a cheat
Wonder how I feel like if that was me
No it ain't fair and I know know that it wrong
And no excuse and I feel like a dog


Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me with them code names
I'm so ashamed
And my girl look at me so strange
Saying I won't change
Oh na na na, oh late night with my lovers
staring at me


And I think she knows 
I think she what's up
I think that she knows enough


I'm para
I'm para
I'm paranoid
I'm must admit
Real mixed emotions that I gotta fix
When she's at work I'm losing my mind
Feeling like she know the truth and I'm blind
Taking my time I got a plan
Plus I'm scared that she won't understand
if she find out then I'll be on my own
Fighting these urges to cheat on her low
No it ain't real
No it ain't cool
No I ain't saying that this is the move
But it was only supposed to be once
But one night turned into a few
I'm such a dick, feel like a cheat
Wonder how I feel like if that was me
No it ain't fair and I know know that it wrong
And no excuse and I feel like a dog


Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me with them code names
I'm so ashamed
And my girl look at me so strange
Saying I won't change
Oh na na na, oh late night with my lovers
staring at me


And I think she knows 
I think she what's up
I think that she knows enough

Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me with them code names
I'm so ashamed
And my girl look at me so strange
Saying I won't change
Oh na na na, oh late night with my lovers
staring at me


I've been so selfish
I've been so blind
I feel so stupid
I don't know why
I got a good girl at home'
And I know she love me so much
And she know I'm up to no good
No good


And I think she knows 
I think she what's up
I think that she knows enough
