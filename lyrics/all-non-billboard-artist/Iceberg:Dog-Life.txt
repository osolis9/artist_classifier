Dog-Life:Iceberg
Dog, that's my man, y'all ready, y'all ready?
Hit 'em hard, hit 'em hard, hit 'em hard

It's funny how I use to serve on the block with grams
Now I'm rollin' with the dog 'cause that's my man
An' these cats stay frontin' with somethin' to prove
That's why I stay away from dudes with nothin' to lose

So the only dogs I roll with off da leash
Off the streets with bodies by Dawson's Creek
'Cause I always did things, ahead of my time
Lead in my nine, throw it in ya head an' ya spine

Y'all could never really imagine all the dirt that I did
Tellin' me I ain't a man but I know I ain't a kid
Sayin' lyrics that I spit ain't teachin' the youth
But you should do you 'cause I'm speakin' the truth

Now I'm a lil' older but I'm still collectin' my bones
Even though I'm sixteen, I'm still holdin' my own
Talk 'bout I best X, bloodline
Shouldn't mess with my dogs 'cause I love mine

The streets keep callin' me, tellin' me
â€½Stay on the block, don't get a job, dog, hustle an' robâ€
An' it's hard to be not able to think about it
Know that this money, I need, I can't even drink without it

When all I see, it's my life, yo' life
Goin' trife from the bad advice
It's the dog in me that's chewin' out ya bad line
Whenever you past the scratch line

See y'all think 'cause I'm a young guy
That I won't let them guns fly
Runnin' in the streets from the one time
Whoever thought I get with my idol
I'm not a shorty no more, I done switched my title

To the real me, a grown man in a small body
I'm the eldest young dog an' the rest of y'all copies
An' if another cat tell me that I'm good for a shorty
Show 'em that I'm good with a 40 cal

Dog, blaow, is you feelin' me now?
Knock ya whole grill out to get rid of ya smile
I could never love a chick 'cause I hit an' be out
We bloodline, you know what this here is about

Just the money, power, respect, girls, flour an' tecs
My dogs shower your set within an hour or less
Start beef, blood leaks out of your sweats
Think a few cats hot but I devoured the rest

The streets keep callin' me, tellin' me
â€½Stay on the block, don't get a job, dog, hustle an' robâ€
An' it's hard to be not able to think about it
Know that this money, I need, I can't even drink without it

When all I see, it's my life, yo' life
Goin' trife from the bad advice
It's the dog in me that's chewin' out ya bad line
Whenever you past the scratch line

'Cause I'm a dog 4 life
An' I was taught to bite on an' off the mic
An' I'm a  dog 4 life
An' everybody 'round the world know 'Berg is tight

'Cause I'm a dog 4 life
I wait until you all alone, come an' snatch your bones
'Cause I'm a dog 4 life
An' you girls only call me a dog 'cause I hit an' be gone

It's my time to play, my turn to ball
Dog, I learned to ball, now I'm burnin' y'all
I changed the game, turned into a major pain
Hollow points from my tip'll rearrange ya frame

It's just my life, dog, doin' grimy things
With them real trife dogs, yeah, aight dog
I spit so sick 'cause I'm with that clique
Bloodline snub nines if it gets that thick

An' I'm a dog 4 life that was taught to bite
On an' off the mic, if it cost my life
Almost lost my life for the cost of ice
Dreamin' real foul things like the Poltergeist

'Cause I'm only sixteen, my raps is mean
I pack the beam, duct tape wrap ya team
Dog is pissed, cats better guard they fence
'Fore I hop over it an' latch on ya pit, c'mon

The streets keep callin' me, tellin' me
â€½Stay on the block, don't get a job, dog, hustle an' robâ€
An' it's hard to be not able to think about it
Know that this money, I need, I can't even drink without it

When all I see, it's my life, yo' life
Goin' trife from the bad advice
It's the dog in me that's chewin' out ya bad line
Whenever you past the scratch line

The streets keep callin' me, tellin' me
â€½Stay on the block, don't get a job, dog, hustle an' robâ€
An' it's hard to be not able to think about it
Know that this money, I need, I can't even drink without it

When all I see, it's my life, yo' life
Goin' trife from the bad advice
It's the dog in me that's chewin' out ya bad line
Whenever you past the scratch line
