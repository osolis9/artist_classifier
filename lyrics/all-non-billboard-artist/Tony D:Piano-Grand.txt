Get the energy up, spread it all around.
Everybody's gonna get it--going through it right now]x2

Everything will be okay.
If you're persistent,
Troubles will seem far away.
Perseverance is the key
To everything you achieve.
Seek out the truth,
Don't forget about what you believe.

Rise above the storm,
You can find what you,
Have been looking for
Climb above the clouds,
You can be the one,
To shout it out loud.

X2

Stay the counts and you can't lose.
Your decision, no one else can make you choose.
Live it out,
The energy will carry you.
It's time to get it--
Go and let it break right through...

Get the energy up, spread it all around.
Everybody's gonna get it--going through it right now.
Get the energy up, spread it all around
Everybody's gonna get it--going through it right now.

Get the energy up,
Get the energy up,
Get the energy up--
spread it all around

rise above the storm,
you can find what you,
will be looking for

Climb above the clouds
you can be the one
to shout it out loud
