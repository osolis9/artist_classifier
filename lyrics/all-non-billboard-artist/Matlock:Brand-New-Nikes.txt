Brand-New-Nikes:Matlock
Guess who's back fucker, roll that weed up
Engineer please turn the god damn beat up
Cat's ridin' tails on your man tuxedo
Yo I signed a hundred rappers but I ain't gon feed ya
This my new shit I'm back in business
If you didn't get this you're on my shit list
I'm at your doormat like Jehova's Witness
With Balboa gloves read' to go the distance
Fly pig up in this
Haters are nervous
Thinkin' I'm a say they little name in my verses
I ain't a manic tho I'm a man with purpose
If I shitted on somebody then they prolly deserved it
Bags of that purp shit, OG Kush
Tell your friends about them yo but this the shush
This rap game Imma beat around the bush
I'm the new Jessie Jacks operation push
Brand New Nikes on
Brand new hat
Fresh out your bitch with a brand new rap
Knock knock motherfucker guess who's back
With some shit for your ass
Where the fuck y'all at?
These girls like you're such a fuckin' asshole Matt
Cause I'm with the next chick in an eleven minutes flat
Fans give me dap then I sign an autograph sayin
"Thanks for the support, one love, and all that"
Some cats hang around smokin' my cigarettes and
Stressin' me out askin' all sorts of questions
You wanna know the secrets of my magic like Kreskin
Like I'm gonna break down now and start confessin'
Here's a question people ask a lot
"How you write your rhymes?" You wanna rap then watch
I smoke massive blocks of hash and pot
Till I float through space like an astronaut
Then I scribble on the page and the track is hot
Then I wave on them haters like a traffic cop
Mr. Show Promoter better have my guap
I'm a motherfucker just like my bastard pops
Brand New nikes
Brand new hat
Fresh out the booth with a brand new track
That's right motherfuckers guess who's back
With some shit for your ass, where the fuck y'all at?
Everybody talkin' bout ya boy ain't right
Cause I cross out tags in the broad daylight
I built my name outta bricks not hype
Respect the architect Frank Lloyd Wright
My first two shits had hits accidentally
Moonshine two times as strong as your Henessey
Mixtape sick straight through to the endin G
2707 crime of the century
Mention me in the tale of this town
Bring some motherfuckers if you comin for this clown
Swim with the big fish you bound to drizzown
Middle finger up never turn my shit down
I'll get down til I'm up in a cage
Got paid, no one's seen me in a couple of days
Puffin haze cuffin strays
Son I'm stuck in my ways
Ain't dumb in brains, I'm just too fuckin stubborn to change
