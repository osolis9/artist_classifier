All-I-Want-For-Christmas-Is-You:Cymphonique
I don't need a Christmas tree
All I need is you with me
Don't care about any gifts
Wrapped in a big red bow

I just want you for myself
More than you could ever tell
Make my Christmas special
All I need this Christmas is you

I don't need a lot this Christmas
There is just one thing I want
Don't care about any gifts
Wrapped in a big red bow

I don't need the new cell-phone
Stacked over the fireplace
Santa Claus can make me jolly
With a ring on Christmas day

I just want you for myself
More than you could ever tell
Make my Christmas special
All I need this Christmas is you

Oh you, oh you, you, baby

I don't need a lot this Christmas
I won't even ask for snow
I'll be right here just waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't write a letter and send it
To the Jolly Old Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magical reindeers click

'Cause I just want you here with me
Loving you could ever see
I really miss you
All I need this Christmas is you

Oh you, oh you, you, baby

Christmas lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of carolers
People stop and stare

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you please bring the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Santa, won't you bring him to me?

I need a lot this Christmas
You're all I'm asking for
I just want to see you smile
Next time I walk through that door

I just want you for myself
More than you could ever tell
Make my Christmas special
All I need this Christmas is you

You, you this Christmas
You, baby
You, you this Christmas
You, baby

All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby
All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby

All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby
All I need this Christmas
Is you, baby
