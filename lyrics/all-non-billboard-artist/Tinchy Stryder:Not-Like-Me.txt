Not-Like-Me:Tinchy Stryder
[[Verse 1]
I'm like, they're like nothing like me
Believe me family, I'm nothing like them
Look, I roll with Dirt but I'm nothing like them
Keep it blue like cancer in them

Yeah, we're like, we're like nothing like youts
If it ain't flow then we're bagging up food
Them are not live, still strapping up zoots
Move like a shotter, nothing like, nothing like

Trust me family, I'm not thing like them
Nah, nah, dead that talk, man I daze them
Daze them golden boy, I'm amazing
Hand on the mic and I'll one time blaze them

Man are like come in like "come 'ere couzzy"
Taliban stylee we kamikaze
I make a boy lean back like he's on a Harley
East manaman in the East manor, man

I'm really out here hustling
P's on the road so we're cashing in
Taking time, I ain't rushing in
Stop talking guns, you ain't bussin' 'em, nah

As for me, I'm the low key Stryder
With everything black from the clothes
To the black Motorola V3 RAZR
I still might answer the private number

[Chorus]
Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching

Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching

[Verse 2]
Trust me, them man are nothing like me
Straight up hoods when I'm 'ere, no blazer
Call me a stunter, sport those Pradas
You still can't see me on a regular

Flows, boy better know that we got the doe
It's only right that we want that
So we write them bars, can't stop that
I'm focused, no time for the hater

Stop fronting, you're nothing like G's
Take what I want, no thanks, no please
Look, look, I plan to lock this game
Right now, one time, then I'm dashing them keys

Yep, yep, Ruff Sqwad, I'm repping this team
Free Roachee, let him back on this scene
I need to draw, two draw, let me zone that
Nah, not today little G

I'm a lean back toker, Cloud 9 blazer
I said not today little G
I'm a lean back toker, Cloud 9 blazer
'Ear what I'm sayin' then flash up your lighter

Call me Tinch, ??? or Stryder
Fam, you're nothing like me, don't hype up
Strictly bad boy rhymes that I write up
'Ear what I'm sayin' then flash up your lighter

[Chorus]
Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching

Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching

[Verse 3]
Yeah, look, I'm on the grind like nothing
I get low like I'm underground or something
Chill for a bit then I stack for a whizzile
Then come through the manor like I'm signed or something

Watch I'll freeze my neck below minus
I'm not like these other guys, they're a minus
Then we cruise through the hood, don't mind us
Got a little name so guys dislike us

I keep telling them it is what it is
Roll with the ??? for now 'til ???
Then we ??? where we live 'cos
If not then I bring it to your gates like knock knock kid, what

I got rhymes, spit flow, get doe
If my doe goes low, move O's
Took time out, now I'm back involved
So I keep telling them that I'm back you know

[Chorus]
Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching

Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching

Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching

Flows, boy better know that we got that doe
It's only right that we want that
Nah, nah, they can't match me
From the hats to the creps, I'm matching
