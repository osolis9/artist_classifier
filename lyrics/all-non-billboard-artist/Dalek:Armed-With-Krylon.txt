Armed-With-Krylon:Dalek
[Verse 1:]
Connect with left to solar plexis
Existence got me vexed it's miraculous I slept
Bent light fall out of frame, this pertain to sole function
maintain a child's wonder wit soul old like earth under.
Measured man's worth by highest standards,
Candid movements remembered by that vicious slander.
He who asks the most questions got the most answers
Never one to pander, but these files are tampered
Touch nerve wit paranoids devoid of joy.
Remain your basic B-Boy with a love for noise.
Through the wildest situations retain my poise.
Perfect pitch in paragraphs that I spit
Microphones get ripped wit syllables full of deeper definitions
Divisive speech patterns, switch so people listen
I carry on traditions, indicative of status.
A street scholar raised spinning wax platters.

[Break:]

I could spend days diggin' through creates.
Love that dusty ass vinyl smell
Come out the shop straight dirt. (45's Lp's 10" 7")

[Chorus:]
Shattered homes spit concrete poems
Armed with Krylon when we roam
Niggas got beef? Go straight for dome!
Plan to walk streets? Best you keep your mental honed.
(2x)

[Verse 2:]
I'm that rare mix of intellect injected savagery.
capable of abstract thought, reality remains ingrained illusions
These false revolutions reduce men to stick figures rockin' Che Guevara,
And they think they trend setters
Should know better
Letters kept left of center!

[Chorus:]
Shattered homes spit concrete poems
Armed with Krylon when we roam
Niggas got beef? Go straight for dome!
Plan to walk streets? Best you keep your mental honed. (2x)

[Break:]

[Chorus:]
Shattered homes spit concrete poems
Armed with Krylon when we roam
Niggas got beef? Go straight for dome!
Plan to walk streets? Best you keep your mental honed. (2x)
