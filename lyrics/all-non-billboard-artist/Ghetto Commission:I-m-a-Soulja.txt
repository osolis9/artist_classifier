 cause we gon ball till we fall 
 see for No Limit I'll do anything 
 to put my name on the wall 

 {Mystikal} 
 even if I gotta shoot to kill on the battlefield 
 march from the ghetto to the top of the hill 
 im black and N-Oed tired of selling boulders 
 trying to keep it real still represent my soldiers 
 started from the bottom finished on the top 
 the wars not over cause the struggle don't stop 
 bullets in the chopper food in the pot 
 money in the bank and weed in my sock 

 {Commission #1} 
 see a coward dies a million deaths 
 but a soldier dies once 
 see don't blame No Limit fool 
 put it on these gats and these blunts 
 and the army had said 
 be all that you can be 
 I made a couple of boulders 
 now every ghetto kid can be p 

 {Chorus} 

 {Commission #2} 
 now im a marked man cause this flame on my arm 
 and the tank around my neck 
 wasn't expected to progress 
 now I hold the industry hostage 
 see it's famed Ghetto Commission 
 TSO till I die 
 my family consist of outlaws 
 and riders who ride 
 im a soldier living this soldiers life 
 flashing my ice 
 when if I get killed on the battlefield 
 then bury me with my steel and my mic 
 ghetto born ghetto raised 
 so I use my ghetto tactics 
 nine times outta ten 
 it results to the second lines and closed caskets 
 in the steel tank I ride 
 from the Westbank to the billboard spots 
 loved by few hated by many 
 but we still wont stop 
 climb from the bottom to the top 
 role with the platinum and gold 
 a commendation from the colonel 
 but still I gotta trunk of soul 

 {Chorus} 

 {Commission #3} 
 im a black dicabileras 
 Spanish for cowboy 
 a no limit soldier 
 that's rowdier than wild boy 
 I keeps a 4-5 in a holster 
 with a rifle across my shoulder 
 im a ghetto vet with a killer click 
 that wont hesitate to smoke ya 
 it's Ghetto Commission till I retire 
 im living larger than a sire 
 no limit symbolizes gas 
 and they done mixed up with some fire 
 peep that flame tatted on my arm 
 wont play when they causing harm 
 we irresponsible for our actions 
 you niggas duck and warn 

 {Commission #4} 
 I got a price on my head 
 because of the gold around my neck 
 and the tank on my chest 
 resting on my arm is a flame 
 I lost ride on the desert plain 
 made famous by wanted posters 
 keep a pistol in my holster 
 cause the laws are getting closer 
 role as a No Limit soldier 
 on our way to the bolder 
 with blood on my hand 
 from the last man to take a stand 
 against me and my clan 
 we wanted, dead or alive 
 believe it or not 
 they jealous of our billboard spot
