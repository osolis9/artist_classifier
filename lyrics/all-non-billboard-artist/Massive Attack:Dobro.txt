Dobro:Massive Attack
I like to dream
My body lands
The window boils of Summer germs
The bed was warm and as is ferns
The cup is broke
Is the pillow dry?
The window smoke where the spirit lies
Get inside my head you see
Get inside

And as I got my fall I lean back
Dragons chase, shallow box across your face
Hit by rocks we never learn
Eastern tales the pillars turn
Pleasure fails are thick as thieves
Now more cardboard crimson leaves
Be going through the motion (motion)

In the sun they meet again
Soul is cold and widen a smile
Busy play and the DJ keeps 
Padded bees when the needle stings
The penny drops in bullet time
Pain on vile while kissing, why?
Any idea that has drawn my past
Come and go fast

Going through the motion (motion)
Beckons in motion (motion)
Be going through the motion (motion)
Beckons in motion (motion)

I have a choice, but will I learn as
The window boils of Summer germs
The bed was warm and as is ferns
The cup is broke
Is-is the pillow dry?
The window smoke where the spirit lies
Get inside my head you see
Get inside

And as I got my fall I lean my back on
Dragons chase, shatter box across your face
Hit by rocks we never learn
Summer pans and pillings turn
Now were cardboard, thick as thieves
Crimson leaves, that has turned
Now were going anytime
Now we can move anytime

Be going through the motion (motion)
Beckons in motion (motion)
Be going through the motion (motion)
Beckons in motion (motion)
