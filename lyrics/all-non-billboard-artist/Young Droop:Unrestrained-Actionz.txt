Unrestrained-Actionz:Young Droop
(Young Droop)
This kritikal nigga be outta control
Got him runnin' around town wit a mac 4-4
? wit the 8 double 0 and a blunt to go
And I'm ready for war (and I'm ready for war)
Run up in yo shit
Takin' everything that I can get?
If I go 6
I'm ready to get you and yo bitch
When I'm bliss-ter (When I'm bliss-ter)
I'm thinkin' of ways for me to get paid
I'm livin' my life as a criminal
Because my actionz aren't restrained
I'm back up in this dirty game
Mutha fuckas done changed turned strained
That's the reason why that I be keepin' my distance
Trynna do my thang
Come down hard like rain
Sharp like thunder feel the pain
But niggas are quick to preserve
Havin' your body burned in flames
Walk in the line of fire
I bet you a nigga wont qualify
187 desire
For the lyrical murderous homicide
Now what goes down
When niggas be tellin' me that I be doin' too much
I gets around
At certain times I feel I can't be touched
We deal wit dust
Just take a look at my sides
You think I'm a coward, mutha fucka
Ain't no one of my associates comin' to give you with automatic showers
Devoured yo ass
Do what I do and get the fuck up
Hit the gas and smash
Smoke a Newport down to the butt
A kritikal assassin
Thinkin' about nothin' but blastin
Look at me laughin'
So don't be like "give me a casket"
