How Deep Is Your Love by The Bird & The Bee
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
and the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again.

And you come to me on a summer breeze
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave me
and it's me you need to show
how deep is your love

How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
breaking us down when they all should let us be
we belong to you and me
I believe in you

I believe in you
you know the door to my very soul
you're the light in my deepest darkest hour
you're my saviour when I come

And you may not think that I care for you
when you know down inside that I really do
and it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
breaking us down when they all should let us be
we belong to you and me
I believe in you

uhhhhh

I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you...
