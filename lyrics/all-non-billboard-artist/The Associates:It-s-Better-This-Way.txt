It-s-Better-This-Way:The Associates
Mmm you hold out your hand
I draw mine away
I was once in touch now I've nothing to say
This time it's for real
We gave now we steal
No tears
For I fear it's much better this way

We can't look at each other
While distance of time
Has smothered all senses
By form or design
If distance is health
Hell what do you say next?

What do you say?
What do you say?

Walk walk walk
It's better this way
Walk walk walk
We can't carry on
As if nothing's happened
As if nothing's wrong

Truth, truth stares in our face
It closes its book
It opens at trust
That's not where we belong

Walk walk walk
It's better this way
We can't carry on
On and on and on and on and on

The room we sat in before
Now closes its door
It's trying to say it can't take
Any more the screams crack the walls
The picture now falls
And who'll be the first to pick them off the-
Love love love on the rocks
Now crumbles like chalk
Your friends were once mine
Now they no longer talk they
All say hello but can't wait
To go we must try to run
We can no longer-

Walk walk walk
It's better this way
Walk walk walk
We can't carry on
As if nothing's happened
As if nothing's wrong

Truth, truth
Stares in our face
It closes its book
It opens at trust
That's not where we belong

Walk walk walk
It's better this way
We can't carry on
As if nothing's happened
As if nothing's wrong

Truth, truth
Stares in our face
It closes its book book
Book book book booklet
It's better this way
