Shoot-the-Dice:Main Attrakionz
[Intro talk: Mondre M.A.N., (Squadda B)]
Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah whats happening tho man (What's poppin tho)
Man I can't call it man I see (Yeah)
Cloud man (Yeah)
Plotting on a hundred thousand man (Uh huh)
You know what I'm saying
A hundred thousand every month you know what I'm saying
(Uh huh)
For the year man thats a mill for a team
Schemes to get a lot of green
One through five I see you you know what I'm saying (Fasho) yes (Aye)

[Verse 1: Mondre M.A.N]
Right now my nigga fuck all of that
All this stress on you gonna cause attacks
Zoned out and I fall in tracks, like I fall in spots, like a Main Attrak
Five chaps with that green face
Got us linking first name Abe
Ham on the track every chance I get
Real saucy with the pen so my fingers I lick
Speaking from my mind, from a whole 'nother angle
From a whole 'nother world, from a whole 'nother vision
Chap two nigga I'ma get it
F.a.m. to that p.m
Weed stems I'm climbing up
Swagging can't get high enough
Spinning like DJ Enuff
Take a sip, take a puff
Like that face on her face I'ma make it up
Like a chopper clap gotta wake it up
Shoot the dice
This the game
Everyday
Everyday

[Hook: Mondre M.A.N]
Everyday
Shoot The Dice
This the Game
Called Life x3

[Verse 2: Shady Blaze]
So much shit in my life got me not thinking right
Paying the price when not civilized
Downing my liquor, I tend to get energized
Finna fly, you can see tension up in my eyes
I'm gaining as much as I'm losing
Which way to go GOD please help me with choosing
Soon in time you will be finding me cruising
Niggas stay u-hauling, gotta keep moving
No stalling, everyone wanna be balling
I'm just right here trying to keep me from starving
I hear the weed calling
Tell me why, I'm not high, but I can see the sky falling
Coming at me along with the world
Green ova on the front line, we been here the whole time
Better get your gun because I hold mines
Green ova give you a loss in no time no shine
I'm just in it to make it but will never will fake it to get it
Never sleeping and I'm way too deep in this rap game to quit it
Main Attrakionz Shady Blaze will teach everyone how to spit it
As long as Friendzone got the beat
Shady Blaze, chap 5, and I'm deep in the streets
All stars all around so don't even compete
All stars all around so don't even compete
Keep moving up, watch where we'll be in a week

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Squadda B]
Stupid Ill, I mix my pills, like Michael Jackson, when he was here
Keep a crease up in my jeans, it's like I had em vacuum sealed
Squadda make her hit a note like Trey Songz
And I been making the hood hop like I was J-Kwon
Aye, my life cold, need more than a blazer
About my biz I'm shady got thangs to blaze ya
R.I.P. to all the greats I'm soon to be one too
I'm zoning out, I'm feeling cool, I let them talk like they the news
Dress them up and let them choose
Make a life I make a move I make myself a superstar I couldn't do it without you
Watch over me when I sleep
Watch over me when I creep
I hate the memories this shit is getting deep
My thoughts is racks a piece if executed millioneeze
Make you a billioncan in billica is where we'll be
Used to steal food to eat I never can forget
The sin of letting my niggas starve I could never commit
Aye
