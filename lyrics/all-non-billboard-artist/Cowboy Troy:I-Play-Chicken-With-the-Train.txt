I-Play-Chicken-With-the-Train:Cowboy Troy
I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh, yeah

Hold 'em up! Here we go
All the hicks and chicks feel the flow
Big black train comin 'round the bend
G'won kinfolk tell ya mom'an'em
Chug-a-lugga, chug-a-lugga, chug-a-lugga who?
The big blackneck comin' through to you
Boy, you done fell and bumped your head
Uh huh, that's what they said

People said it's impossible
Not probable, too radical
But I already been on the CMA's
Hell, Tim McGraw said he like the change
And he likes the way my hick-hop sounds
And the way the crowd screams when I stomp the ground
I'm big and black, clickety-clack
And I make the train jump the track, like that

I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh, yeah

From mic to cassette deep into your ear
My voice is your choice that you wanted to hear
Southern boy makin' noise where the buffalo roam
Flesh, denim and bone as you might have known
See me ridin' into town like a desperado
With a big belt buckle, the cowboy bravado
All over the world wide web you'll see, download CBT on an mp3

Speak clearly what I'm sayin' so you'll comprehend
Hit the net for hick-hop radio, tune in
Rollin' like thunder on the scene
It's kinda hard to describe if you know what I mean
I never claimed to be the hardest of the roughest hard rocks
But I'm boomin' out yo' box, skills got you jumpin' outch'a socks
From Texas here I come, movin' yo body with a bass kick drum

I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh, yeah

I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh, unh huh
I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh

You know that I play chicken with the train
Play chicken with the train train
Unh huh huh, unh huh huh
You know that I play chicken with the train
