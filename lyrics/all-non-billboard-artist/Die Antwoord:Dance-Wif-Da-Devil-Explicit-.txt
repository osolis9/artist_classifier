Dance-Wif-Da-Devil-Explicit-:Die Antwoord
(feat. The Black Goat)

Our band is called Die Antwoord and that means "The Answer"
The peoples from America, they say a little bit funny because they can't say it right
How do they say it? They say...
They say like "Die Antword", it sounds a bit fucking stupid actually
Die Antwoord, Die Antwoord
Die Antwoord
Ant-, Die Ant-, Ant-, like "cunt"
Then "woord": Die Antwoord
Yo
Say it properly
