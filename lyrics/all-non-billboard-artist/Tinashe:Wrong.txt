Wrong:Tinashe
I'm braver
Look at you
Do you even know who you are?
Do you even know what's true?
You know you're wrong
You know you're wrong
You know you're wrong
So fuckin' wrong, you're so damn wrong
You did me wrong
And you do it again, and you do it and you do it again
And you do it again, I let you do it, let you do it again
You did me wrong
And you do it again, and you do it and you do it again
And you do it again, I let you do it, let you do it again

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
You're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong
I swear one day, one day I will be gone
You're fuckin' wrong

Wake up inside of my castle
I banish you from my heart
I do not care if you love me
You know you're wrong from the start
Wake up and I get the money
The money come every day
And it still feels like your lovin'
Ten billion dollars away
Ten billion dollars away
Ten billion dollars away

I'm braver
Look at you
Do you even know who you are?
I don't recognize you, only in the dark
Don't know you're wrong
But I wanted it
So good that it hurts
It's hard to resist that body
You evicted me
That strip from your lips, it hurts me to see
You accepted it, disrespected it
Now I wanna leave, but secretly

I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
You're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong
I swear one day, one day I will be gone
You're fuckin' wrong

Wake up inside of my castle
I banish you from my heart
I do not care if you love me
You know you're wrong from the start
Wake up and I get the money
The money come every day
And it still feels like your lovin'
Ten billion dollars away (You're fuckin' wrong)
Wake up inside of my castle
I banish you from my heart (You know you're wrong)
I do not care if you love me
You know you're wrong from the start (You know you're wrong)
Wake up and I get the money
The money come every day (You know you're wrong)
And it still feels like your lovin' (So fuckin' wrong)
Ten billion dollars away
Ten billion dollars away
Ten billion dollars away
