I-Need-You-Tonight:Professor Green
Hello?
Hello, babe, what's happenin'? You cool?
Oh, yeah, you're alright, what's happenin'?
I'm good, what's goin' on?
Yeah, nothin', I'm chillin'
Alright, what are you up to later?
Oh, yeah, about that, do you know what? I'm leaving, can I call you back?

I need you tonight

This ain't so stereotypical man
Not for a stereotypical man
It should be me that wants to get rid of you
Instead it's you that don't give a damn

It was meant to be a one night thing
Nothing more than a little one night fling
Now when I'm in need, you're the one that I ring
I need you tonight

Might she's playin' hard to get
A brunette with such class, she's hard to forget
See, at first I wasn't after her heart
But I couldn't stop thinkin' about her after I left

I'm beginning to lose my cool
It appears in love I have fallen
I'm ready to put my all in
And all she does is ignore my calls

She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, yet oh so cold to me?
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right?
I wish I never, but I need you tonight

This lady's driving me crazy
She blows hot and cold like the AC
I just can't figure her out
Next time I'm with her, I'm pinning her down

I'm gonna find out if she's on it or not
'Cause all of this shit is long
See, I front like I'm okay but I'm not
I'm being played at my own game

And it's long, I ain't no idiot
I'm blow, I'm no intermediate
So next time she phones me
I ain't even pickin' it up to speak in it

No, swear down
Wait a minute, that's her now
Hello?
I really want to see you today
Alright, just give me a time and a place, I'll be there

She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, yet oh so cold to me?
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right?
I wish I never, but I need you tonight

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I want you, won't stop until I've got you
There's nothing I will not do, I need you tonight

Look, I ain't never been the type to be this, no
I ain't never been the type to be whipped
She's exposing a side of me that
I'm tryin' to fight, I'm tryin' to hide

My pride, I'm tryin' to find it
But ain't seen it, I'm an idiot
I know, but can't help it, I'm fiendin'
I need you tonight

She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, yet oh so cold to me?
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right?
  (This does not happen to me, I am me!)
I wish I never, but I need you tonight

I need you, I need you
  (Swear down, it's just a song)
I need you, I need you
  (In real life, this would never happen to me)
I need you, I want you, won't stop until I've got you
  (I am a pimp, women chase me, I do not chase women)
There's nothing I will not do, I need you tonight
  (Swear down, swear down)
