Lalalalalalalalalalala...

My baby, my baby,
Let me know,
Because you love me, you love me,
Let me go,
And you're my lover, you pay me,
Twice my size,
And on your knees you lay,
In my thighs...

Take my hand and let's end it all,
She broke her little bones,
On the boulders below,
Take my hand and let's end it all...

My baby, my baby,
Let me go,
And if you love me, you love me,
Let me go,
Cause I'm your brother, your brother,
Have some pride,
And now you love me, you love me,
Then die tonight...

Take my hand and let's end it all,
She broke her little bones,
On the boulders below,
Take my hand and let's end it all,
Broke her little bones.
On the boulders below,
And while she fell I delightfully said...

Lalalalalalalala lie lie lie...She took my hand and I let her go,
She broke her little bones,
On the boulders below,
Took my hand and she ended it all,
Broke her little bones on the boulders below,
And while she fell, I smiled...

Lalalalalalalala lie lie lie...
