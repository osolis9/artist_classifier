Sometimes:La Coka Nostra
[Intro]

They were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. By chance or design, man has inherited out of the dark mystery of time and space

[Verse 1]

Sometimes I fill my mind with rhymes that's so divine to find
Somehow gets crossed till what I'm doing is lost
And I can't take back the truth of the fact
The way I act and put together these parts that ain't intact
Makes me want to scream and it makes me want to fight
When I can't think of a way to just make this shit alright
So I stop sort of struggling, I often losing sight of these
Things that I be knowing that could make it alright

[Interlude]

Yet across an immense ethereal gulf
Minds that are to our minds
Sometimes

Yet across an immense ethereal gulf
Minds that are to our minds

Yet across an immense ethereal gulf
Minds that are to our minds
Sometimes

Yet across an immense ethereal gulf
Minds that are to our minds

[Verse 2]

Seems like lately this life has got me dealing the stress
Trying to get a job or a paycheque, never having a breath
So my feet hurt and I need work just like all the rest

Sometimes I feel like giving up even though I'm this far
But my dreams, they just ain't big enough trying to reach for the stars
Gotta change just how I'm thinking and start to re-arrange
Cause these games is only leading to a life in the same plane
What I gain is up to me and I'm not gonna let it be
Till I see one million CDs sold in this industry
So it's time for me to break with this rhyme I'm gonna make
So it'd be a crime for y'all to hate, it's my fate that

[Verse 3]

So every morning at sunrise I open my eyes
And tell myself that I'm gonna shine before I reach my demise
And I rise up out this mould and I'm not gonna lose control
Cause my life is like a rhyme and it's mines up in this?
Sometimes I feel the stress, sometimes I wanna break
But I know it's just a reason they gonna call me a fake
So I break up out these chains and maintain my flow
Cause sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes
