Food-Play:Lady Sovereign
This one's for the lovers out there
For those who like their food to enhance their mood for love
From the depths of the sea to the heavens up above

I just love the way Haagen-Dazs drips down your cheek
The way you munch your quarter pounder
Oh my, the way you chew that cheese, you sleaze

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like, I wanna try
Food play

We can have a laugh with a tub of Haagen-Dazs
We can watch the moon 'cause I know you love the stars
We're sharing two scoops with one spoon, it's too cute
It's kinda turning me on right now, so what you wanna do?

We can food fight 'cause I'm in the mood tonight
Dirty kisses, dirty dishes in my sink, I'll be your dirty misses
What ya think? I think flirtin' is vicious
Especially after a meal when you start lickin' your fingers

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like, I wanna try
Hey baby, put out that cigarette and drive over here

You make my nips hard just like cherry pips
And you can make me hit 'em high notes that Mariah Carey hits
We can share our pie and chips, check out my diet tips
You don't need to eat that burger sauce, just rub it 'round your lips

We can food fight 'cause I'm in the mood tonight
Ice cubes in my room, something we should try soon
I like you, I like this, melt it down while my kiss is
Sugar coated from the seas, I'll be your genie, I grant your wishes

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like, I wanna try

You wanna try?
You wanna come and play with me?
You wanna come and lay with me?
Ha, ha, ha, yeah, sexy, sexy baby

Spoons, ice cream, crisps, food blenders
Fridges, lick that plate, lick that spoon

Push me, push me up against that fridgerator, I ain't frigid
I'm just expressin' myself as one really hungry midget
Crack open them twiglets so we can munch them like piglets
So we can get hot and heated, now tell me are you really livin' it?

Now chocolates, caramel and runny honey
You can run it all over my face or even on my tummy
What about an English breakfast that could be really yummy?
Or you could cover me in porridge
Oh, porridge

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
Don't think I didn't notice you're teasing me with food lately
Sugar, honey, hanky-panky pie
You're doing something that I really like, I wanna try

Smoke a little smoke, tell a little joke
And go ha, ha, ha with the Sovereign Lady
English breakfast, a sexy English breakfast
