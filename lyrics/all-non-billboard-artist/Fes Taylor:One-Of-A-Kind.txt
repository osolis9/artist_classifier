One-Of-A-Kind:Fes Taylor
[Fes Taylor]
My Sunday chick sware that she running shit
Til I give it to her stiff, then she shut up her lips
My Monday honey, looking like a Hugh Hef' bunny
Gave her 10 grand, then she even grew breasts for me
Miss Tuesdays, made me mash potatoes and cube steaks
Devil's food cakes, stand by me never lose faith
My Wednesday mami, might buy a 10 K probably
If she go down, I hit say lolly
Tasty Thursdays, look at what her pops and her earth made
Look so good, damn they should worship your birthplace
Miss Friday, catch her right after the club
Like hop in ma, passing the bud
Sexy Saturdays, give me lots of happy days
But she always sad when I gotta hit the road, she like 'daddy stay'
I need a girl for every day of the week
A different pretty face every time I lay in the sheets

[Chorus 2X: Fes Taylor]
I'm too much man for one woman
But we can all share, I got enough to put in
I do the type of things, most niggas wouldn't
Not because they wont, just cuz they couldn't (ma, I'm one of a kind)

I seen Friday on Thursday, she acting like it's her day
You know how these birds play, my word play
Keep Monday from going at it with Sunday
But Wednesday, hold down the hammer after the gun spray
Tuesday, I bring the 'vette out, but she never drive it
I let the top down, pull over, I let her ride it
Saturday night in the caddy with Mike
She got a fatty, make me wish I really had me a bite
My peoples laughing, they like 'son, how you pull it off'
Maybe they put up with my shit, cuz I push the Porsche
Nah, my g is tight, come on girl
No it's not your day, no, you can't see me tonight
Don't really care if you stay or you leave
I switch two to number one, then replace number three

[Chorus 2X]
