The-Miracle:Prime Time
And then the curtain falls, ending hope and glory
Through a gloomy star loneliness invades
When the heart is frozen and you're to fall apart
Life will find it's way

That's when you find love...

Now let it take your hand
We're heading out towards the promised land
Take the stairway to your soul
Now don't you understand
The future ends each day

She lived thousand lies, never ending story
A life in compromise, never sows it's seeds
When the spell is broken and you can see the light
Welcome your first day

That's when you find love...

Now let it take your hand
We're heading out towards the promised land
Take the stairway to your soul
Now don't you understand
The future ends each day

[Solo: Henrik]

The meaning of life comes alive when you need it
Changing the dark into light, night to day

Now let it take your hand
We're heading out towards the promised land
Take the stairway to your soul
Now don't you understand
The future ends each day
