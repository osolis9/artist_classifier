See-Through:Katy B
I see my eyes getting darker
And my skin getting paler
I see my hair getting longer
And my nails getting shorter

I feel my knees getting weaker
And my heart heavier
I feel our love getting deeper
But not in a good way...

()
I can't reach you
Your soul's gone see through
I don't know what you're into
Like I did before

I feel my mind set ...
But my blood's still pumping
So hard I can see it
Well I choose to believe it

Now this feels hardest
'Cause my heels in the carpet
And your voice seems louder
Since you've got more power

()
But I can't reach you
Your soul's gone see through
I don't know what you're into
Like I did before

Do you want me to set you free?
Oh set you free, show me
How it is, how you do
And now I'm standing right in front of you
And now you're gone, or so it seems

Let me know when I'm back in your dreams
And I'll tell you if you're in mine

But I can't reach you
Your soul's gone see through
I don't know what you're into
Like I did before...
