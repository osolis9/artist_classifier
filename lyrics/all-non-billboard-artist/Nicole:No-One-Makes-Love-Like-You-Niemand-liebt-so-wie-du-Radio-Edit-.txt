There's a secret so reveil it
Cos there's something you should know
When my heart's achin', only you can heal it, it's just feelin', touch and go
Touch and go

You can prove it there's only one test to make sure what you need is me
Makin' love's no lovin' contest
One night with you could last eternally

And in my heart you're like an angel
And in my dreams you're like a girl
And in my arms you're like a woman
And in my soul you're like a pearl

And no one makes love like you
Nobody makes love like you
Your touch makes be feel brandnew
No one like you
And no one makes love like you
No one like you
And I feel it too - baby it's true
No one makes love like you
Just gimme your love love love
Gimme your love love love
Gimme your love love love
Like you used to do
No one makes love like you
Nobody
And I'd fell for you right out of the blue
No one makes love like you

Baby, baby no one makes it like you

Sometimes I feel you're like a stranger
But I'll do anythin' for you
I have to be careful baby cos I'm in danger
You use my heart and body too

You're so tender - you got so much passion
Who needs the rest - I've got the best
And it feels as ...
Against ... the dreams and goin' much too fast

And in my heart you're like an angel
Mmh I'm your angel
And in my dreams you're like a girl
Yes I'm your girl
And in my arms you're like a woman
Like a woman
And in my soul you're like a pearl

And no one makes love like you
No one makes love like you
Your touch makes me feel brandnew
Nobody makes love like you
No one makes love like you
And I feel it too - baby it's true

No one makes love like you

Just gimme your love love love
Gimme your love love love
Gimme your love love love
Like you used to do
And no one makes love like you
And I'd fell for you right out of the blue

No one makes love like you

One, two, three, four
No one makes love like you
Your touch makes me feel brandnew
No one makes love like you
And I feel too - oh baby it's true

No one makes love like you

Just gimme your love love love
Gimme your love love love
Gimme your love love love
Like you used to do
No one makes love like you
And I'd fell for you right out of the blue
No one makes love like you
No one
Nobody baby

No one makes love like you
And I feel it too - baby it's true
No one makes love like you

Nobody baby
Nobody baby
Nobody baby - I feel it - I feel it - I can feel it
No one makes love like you
Nobody nobody makes love like you
Nobody baby, nobody, nobody, nobody makes love like you
Like you
