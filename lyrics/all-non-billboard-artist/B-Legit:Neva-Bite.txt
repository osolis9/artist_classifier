Neva-Bite:B-Legit
Yeah, now this is here is somethin'
That you never ever in life do you know

It goes down in my click the dogs they all simmer
At the same time , ninety-six to the hard top brandy wine
Gettin' mine in a big fashion
A eleven pounds in the back of the Volvo wagon

Money long like the perm on the superbad
And hella fools in the game all what you had
Mail, the brew, it got me evil with the six
So I'm ridin' with my peepers

I'm on the block and the new booties don't know me
Comin' through buyin' fifty sacks from the homie
I'm on the cony, mug got 'em in suspense
Peace sign 'cause they peep my gauge on the fence

Common sense if you niggas had a little of it
And didn't know me, your ass in the middle of it
You understand that I'm the man that'll bleed ya
Never bite the hand that feed ya

Now you see, some of you niggas is in it for the glory
And not for the story
Never bit the hand that feed ya
So we gone hang out these nuts and teach you new bucks how to
Never bite the hand that feed ya

And at the same time crease your brain with a heavy start to this game
Never bit the hand that feed ya
'Cause shit don't quit, we know the poplockin' mix seventeen for the twix
Never bit the hand that feed ya

It's for the scrilla, love to count the notes
Me and my folks landcruise to the boat then we all smoke
Vegas, on the sega we choppin' game
And they tell me fool talkin' bad on my name

Claim he the one that made a nigga all his paper
And if you quit than it ain't no B-legit
Heard the shit and I was quik to cut his ass off
Shit it did it first time that you took a loss

But I didn't matter fact, I let you breathe
But you ain't nathen but a trick up a nigga sleeve
I charge a high price, I said, "The shit was ice"
Candy clean but I sold you a dream

And than you think I'm the one to get over on
Don't let me catch you comin' in and out a nigga's zone
'Cause I'ma buck ya, fuck ya, I don't need ya
Never bite the hand that feed ya

You lame motherfucker
Boy don't you know I got enough blow to make it snow
Never bite the hand that feed ya
'Cause Snowwhite is the flavor they save up here neighbour
Never bite the hand that feed ya

So don't you driwwle that swiwwle round here, nigga
Never bite the hand that feed ya
And if ya thinkin' about breathin' I'ma keep feedin' and uh
Never bit the hand that feed ya

Now I done been around the world once or twice
In every state I done seem to escape vice
Knock bitches and peel the head of a drum
And baby girl got a ass just like her mama

And what would it take to get your ass out to Cali
Where niggas knock dubs off in the alley
A plane ticket, roundtrip to the bay
A rental car and a cool ass place to stay

Now where you lay, I consider that my under spot
So don't tell a soul 'cause I don't want it hot
The first year she got she was out makin' friends
And when she really need to be out makin' endz

A close folk, shit got cut short
So get your thangs, bitch you headed for the airport
And it's a shame I ain't even get a chance to spread ya
But you bit the hand that fed ya

Bitch, how many niggas on my team can get ate
For a trip to the golden state
Never bite the hand that feed ya
Hoe, it could be kosher, as long as my mail is in motion
Never bite the hand that feed ya

This ain't true to there so beware
'Cause I'ma run ya till ya pay ya fare
Never bite the hand thad feed ya
And if you can't find yourself or lose yourself on the next thang
Never bite the hand that feed ya

'Cause I'ma keep my composure and stay high on this dohja
Never bite the hand that feed ya
Ain't no sweat of my back cause the tramp played her self like a batch
Never bite the hand that feed ya

And if you think I  I'ma show you what a mack look like
Never bite the hand that feed ya
'Cause in [Incomprehensible] by my side ready to ride
Never bite the hand that feed ya

[Incomprehensible]
Never bite the hand that feed ya
[Incomprehensible]
Never bite the hand that feed ya
[Incomprehensible]
