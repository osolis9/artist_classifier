RB runs the show

I'm just too hot to handle in the matter of rap
The elements of relevance are locked in the track
I buckle up, run the shop, take it to the top
But I'm still laid back as I fade the crack
I tap the bottle and twist the cap
I bring the essence of pleasance to fight the wack
I'm majestic, you can test this
With the skills I've got yo!
I should be arrested

1, 2, 3, 4, get with the wicked

Deetah, rap out

Better turn da lights down! Who's there? Have no fear
Been there to 'relax' now I came to prepare
La Gata's on da loose, lyrical abuse be aware
Ahora con el wicked I declare
You can get a woo woo a what what
I rock wild- RB help me out now

Don't worry, I've got you, that's how we get down
Blaze to amaze - make it hot, understand

From crowns to pounds- kilo to ounce
Bounce, here's a chance to relieve dat tense
Loose up those pants an' up with those hands!
Get with da hardest ill Chica on a trance!
I occupy this bar from dusk 'til dawn, dawn 'til dusk
24 hours I bust
Whenever, however, on whatever I want
Anytime, any place, anywhere, I'm prepared!

1, 2, 3, 4, get with the wicked
Can I get a woo woo
Chicks get with it

Fellas you know

This is where the science ends and you better enter the lion's den
Yes my friend, where flows get bent and twisted
It's the UK whizzkid, who gets paid big, yes I'm afraid so

Drop some hot 'ish' got you all hyped out
Now check mi Chicas y Chicos how liberated, stimulated
Satisfaction I'm creatin'

I run the rules of the trade
Get you afraid of the facts
When you're missing the dissing
It's time to react

Up with those hands for Claudeetah
Da extraordinary Senorita
Lyrical abuse yeah, you best believe dat

Run with the true cat
Forget the sewer rat

Run with the true cat
Forget the sewer rat

Is where you from kid
Is where you at!

1, 2, 3, 4, get with the wicked
