Let-Me-Be:Maceo
Just let me be,
I ain't worried about you,
Don't worry 'bout me.
Do your own thang,
just let me be.
I ain't gotta speak to you.
You ain't gotta speak to me.
I call it how I see it,
Just let me be
You ain't gotta see me,
I ain't gotta see you.
Do what you do,
Just let me be.
You will respect me,
I will respect you
and we'll be cool.

Don't worry about me,
Worry about yourself,
look out for your kids
Don't they need your help?
Get up out my business, let me handle mines.
worry 'bout yourself then you'll be fine.
You will have a benz, you will have a house,
as long as you keep a nigga name out yo mouth.
Fifty got a boat, diddy got a crib,
They do their young thing, I don't worry 'bout them
You ain't gotta speak, you aint gotta talk,
Throw them deuces up,
continue with yo walk.
I feel the jealousy,
It's all in yo eyes,
Mad that I made it, Now you look surprised,
Don't give me that, I know that shit fate,
talk behind my back,
then smile in my face.

Just let me be,
I ain't worried about you,
Don't worry 'bout me.
Do your own thang
just let me be.
I ain't gotta speak to you.
You ain't gotta speak to me
I call it how I see it
Just let me be
You ain't gotta see me,
I ain't gotta see you.


Do what you do
Just let me be
You will respect me,
I will respect you.
and we'll be cool.

You ain't gotta see me,
I ain't gotta see you.
I focus on my raps, you do what you do.
You ain't gotta like me,
Don't buy my c.d,
Don't show up at my shows,
lookin' for some beef,
Quit acting like my brawls, pitchin' attitudes,
Rollin' yo eyes, what that 'spose to do?
You tryna mean more, but you ain't said a word.
Come tellin' me, shit that you heard.
you ain't here for my love,
so what you talkin' bout?
Find out the truth before you open your mouth.
just respect me and I'll respect you,
and shit will be aiight,
and we'll keep it cool.

Yeah tell the truth,
You aint gotta lie,
You aint gotta impress me,

fake ass nigga,
flexin' ass nigga.

Don't worry 'bout me.
Do your own thang
