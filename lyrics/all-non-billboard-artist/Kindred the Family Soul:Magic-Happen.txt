Magic-Happen:Kindred the Family Soul
Don't matter what we drive
The neighborhood where we live
Don't matter what kind of gift
Or what kind of ring you give

Just don't take me for granted
And let me know everyday
That love unconditionally is coming my way

'Cause even if the world
Is falling apart all around us
Let my love be your shelter, baby

Coming out of the rain, come out, no
'Cause I know one thing about us
That our love is like heaven, baby
Rich or poor I know I love you the same

I ain't gotta tell you, you should already know
Just incase you needed to hear it, well, here it goes
Said I love you more than you can ever imagine
You make magic happen, you make magic happen

[Incomprehensible] I forgot
Special things you've done
From the day that you came into my life
The day you had my first son

Sometimes I can't understand it
It remains a mystery
How it started as you and me
Look at us, now we are family

And even if the worlds come
Tumbling down all around us
We got a solid foundation

I'm gonna tell everybody, with you I have a son
Oh, the joy you've given me
Through all these years
I got the sweetest memories

I ain't gotta tell you, you should already know
Just incase you needed to hear it, well, here it goes
Said I love you more than you can ever imagine
You make magic happen, you make magic happen

In my life, in my life, my life
Said you made the difference in my life, in my life
Oh, you made so much magic
