Save-Me:Prime Time
[Solo: Henrik]

Open heart and open mind is what it takes
To glide along, on crystal snow forever
When you left, I held your hand fought
Back my tears and watched you go...
A moment lost to everybody

Save me - I can't believe, I let you go
Save me - I need you here
Save me - I can't believe...

Slow... the night moves on, nut I don't feel
The urge to reach the day
My darkness rules forever
On our bed I sit, your hands as cold
As ice, your eyes, your face...
Your beauty lost for everybody

Save me - I can't believe, I let you go
Save me - I need you here
Save me - I can't believe...

[Solo: Henrik]

Save me - I can't believe, I let you go
Save me - I need you here
Save me - I can't believe...
