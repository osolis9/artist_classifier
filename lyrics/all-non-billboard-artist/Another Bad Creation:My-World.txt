My-World:Another Bad Creation
1991
What's going on here?
Don't you know the kids only imitate their atmosphere?
Yeah, that's what I thought
So, who do we follow now?

What else is there to say?
You better do something before it's too late
A message from the kids
Who love to hate
Peace

In my world
(My world)
(My world)
(My world)

In my world
We the kids have to find our roads
Does anyone care where we go?

Stop this fighting and teach us right
'Cause we're livin's a lie
I'm only a kid
(In my world)

I can't wait to get a lil' bigger
(In my world)
I can only do so much
(In my world, world)

Schoolwork's got me under pressure
(In my world)
I'm only a kid

Don't they know kids have problems of their own?
You always find a stand
That makes us something wrong

Drugs, war, things we shouldn't see
Just take it from me, I'm only a kid
(In my world)

I can't wait to get a lil' bigger
(In my world)
I can only do so much
(In my world, world)

Schoolwork's got me under pressure
(In my world)
I'm only a kid
(In my world)

I can't wait to get a lil' bigger
(In my world)
I can only do so much
(In my world, world)

Schoolwork's got me under pressure
(In my world)
I'm only a kid

So I guess you know by now
People have to unite to make sure we do things right
Ya' know, what makes it so hard?

Say something, cat got your tongue?
Fortunately, we're not blind
Another good case of being hip to reality
 (In my world)

I can't wait to get a lil' bigger
(In my world)
I can only do so much
(In my world, world)

Schoolwork's got me under pressure
(In my world)
I'm only a kid
(In my world)

I can't wait to get a lil' bigger
(In my world)
I can only do so much
(In my world, world)

Schoolwork's got me under pressure
(In my world)
I'm only a kid

In my world
(My world)
(My world)
(My world)
In my world
