Without-You:Jake Miller
If you had a choice then
what would you choose, to do.
I can live without money,
I can live without the fame and
if every day was sunny I can live
without the rain and if I ever went
up to heaven I will fall right back
down that life wouldnt be living,
cause your the one I couldn't live without.

If I couldn't blink will I still
be able to see you.
I couldn't imagine (ooohoo)
without arms could I reach,
no way could I ever hold you (ohohooo)
I need these things, like I need you,
if you had a choice what would you choose .

I can live without money, I can live without
the fame and if every day was sunny
I can live without the rain and if I ever
went up to heaven I will fall right back
down that life wouldnt be living,
cause your the one I couldn't live without.

If I couldn't dream would I believe
that there can be a you and me and
if I couldn't sing would you be able
to hear my melody, I know that somethings
wrong and im afraid that your moving on,
how can I fly when your my wings.
I need these things, like I need you,
if you had a choice what would you choose.

I can live without money, I can live
without the fame and if every day was sunny
I can live without the rain and
if I ever went up to heaven
I will fall right back down
that life wouldnt be living,
cause your the one I couldn't live without.

You can take it all from me,
and it wouldn't mean anything,
turn the whole world against me
as long as you don't leave.
Its getting hard for me to sleep,
even harder for me to breath.
Im used to life with you,
tell me what I need to do.

I can live without money, I can live
without the fame and if every day
was sunny I can live without the rain and
if I ever went up to heaven
I will fall right back down
that life wouldnt be living,
cause your the one I couldn't live without.

I can live without money, I can live
without the fame and if every day
was sunny I can live without the rain and
if I ever went up to heaven
I will fall right back down
that life wouldnt be living,
cause your the one I couldn't live without.
