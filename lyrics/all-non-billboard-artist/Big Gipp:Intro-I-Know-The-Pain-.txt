Intro-I-Know-The-Pain-:Big Gipp
I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain

Let it be known Gipp love to bury muffins with no stuffin'
Problem child to this industry like David Ruffin'
155 pounds going straight in your kisser
And take a position, then split a partition, I started rollin' with a mo' home

Pick up a penny hope it turn into a twenty but the day end home
A classic in the street like Reebok
Grew up on the human beat box, I kick the door up off the hinge
I roll the windows to the ceiling

Been on a mission, dealing with my feelings like Max Payne
Analytically driven, emotionally living in pain
If I had to do it, oversee, I do it again
I know

I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain

Yeah, I do this for the kids, I do this for the mommas
I do this for the children that ain't ever had a father
Too many to remember mentally but yo I try
Sometimes I'm blinded by the cataracts up in my eye

Like Little Bo Peep, she standing in the street
And even ain't got no shoes for them mutilated feet
Good golly Miss Molly, addicted to Bacardi
Don't even know the difference between love and a party

And old men con young women, that's wrong
Don't they know the 30s and the 40s been gone
Inconspicuously, I slide to the side on
[Incomprehensible] I hypnotize through the voice tone

Already been, confronted myself to transcend
Tales from an adolescent years to young teens
When everything I used to own, used to sit on the dresser
I rode the bus to [Incomprehensible] the train
I know the rain, I know the pain

Construction jobs kept callouses on my hand
I know the pain
Crystallize me to a man
I know the pain
Believe in something higher then man
I know the pain
When it didn't work I fell on my knees and called his name
  (I know, I know, I know, I know pain)

I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain
