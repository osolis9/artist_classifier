so do friends so do bitches but it's nothin' though
I got haters 'cause I made it mother fuck y'all

jealousy a bitch and I guess I'm her man understand?

As I tip toe to the finish line, I'ma get what's mine

two blunts to the face and we sip until we wasted
thizzin' out my body got no motherfuckin' patience
fin to give the whole Bay a facelift
you know who it is see the look on they faces?
it's amazin' Latinas and Asians
white girls, dike girls, all want to taste this
I'm treated like I'm already famous
grindin' with your girl but I thought that was your main bitch?
never mind that I'm on that insane shit
Curt, Bari and Styles, that take over the Bay shit
better yet the nation, never hesitatin'
to smoke in the function, fin to need ventilation
y'all on some dumb shit sayin' shit that I'm still ignorin'
I'm cold hearted, sympathy? nah I don't feel it for 'em (fuck 'em)
lil' homies want a bottle so I steal it for 'em
tell bitches drop dub roll some weed up for 'em
if they didn't know what's up, then they know now
probably why they be tryin' to shut my shows down
off of drugs, performin' at the club
sippin' on this bub got me feelin' like a thug
what's up?
the head feel so amazin' when I'm buzzed
plus these red pills got me sayin' I'm in love
when it's all said and done, I'm just tryin' to see a milli
let 'em say what they wanna haters ain't got to feel me
if real respect real then fake respect fake
weak respect weak and the strong respect strength
