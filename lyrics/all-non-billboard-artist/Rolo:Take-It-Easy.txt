Take-It-Easy:Rolo
Take it easy
Everything is gonna be alright
Take it easy
You know I hate to see you cry
Take it easy
Gimme just a little smile
Take it easy
I drew a picture in the sand but the clouds are coming closer
Still when it's gonna rain
Do you remember the day
You loved swiming in the deep and now you're drifting far away
'Cause we had nothing but our hand
We picked up all the pennies that we found along the way
And now look at what we have
But in the end that doesn't matter
'Cause you're not here to stay
Take it easy
Everythings gonna be alright
Take it easy
You know I hate to see you cry
And take it easy
Gimme just a little smile
Take it easy
Take it easy
And now there's nothing left to do but try to put back all those little puzzle pieces in your mind
And do you even know my name
But try to tell me what you see when you look inside my face
And you don't even seem to care if it's winter or it's springtime out the window where you stare
Try to hold on to your hand
But you just grab on to my fingers to say let go but i can't
Take it easy
Everythings gonna be alright
Take it easy
You know I hate to see you cry
And take it easy
And gimme just a little smile
Take it easy
Take it easy
Everythings gonna be alright
Take it easy
You know I hate to see you cry
And take it easy
And gimme just a little smile
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Everythings gonna be alright
Take it easy
You know I hate to see you cry
And take it easy
Gimme just a little smile
Take it easy
