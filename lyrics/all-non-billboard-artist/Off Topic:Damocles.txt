Damocles:Off Topic
As we are bombarded by stimulus from the environment around us our senses numb
To the sound of war drums and the warning signs of what's to come down on us
We're already dead, already dust
In God we trust, take care if us
Or something like that
When a warhead splits into 55 pieces we all get hit
Like oh shit
My skin just melted and dripped
So did my outfit, and I just washed it
But I couldn't stop it
Everybody fights with each other all day
Narrow-minded, short-sighted, motherfuckers gonna pay
Went to run for cover til my cover got blown away
Now I'm standing in the driveway
I see my mom 50 yards in the distance
Covered in blisters
She was calling her sister and the line went dead
My dad was already in bed cause he had to get up and work to keep the family fed
Last thing I saw was like a flash bulb
The impact left an outline of my body on the wall
And you're fighting over a parking spot at the mall
And you spent the last five years in that cubicle
And you're so confused by life you're addicted to food
Because it soothes you for the time being
These are the times we live in
Watcha gonna do about it
Everyone is partially brainwashed
And a clean mind is easy to watch
Right now I'm caked in mud and my mental's sweaty in the crotch
And I'm hard to stop
How can we communicate with other cultures
When we feed on each other like vultures?
Slaves to impulses
Nobody deals with consequences
And we all got fences, apprehensive
And lawyers are on the offensive
Gotta put their two cents in
And come out with a Benjamin
Wanna say fuck the system
But it's hard to stop

I remember the day when my bright eyes faded away

The pain fades as I fade away like so many years ago
As I descended to the shadows
My world's aglow like so much nitro
Lit by some pyro that I don't even know
Would never disrespect me, had he met me
Cause if we disagree I'm hard to stop
It's all said and done, so soon I'd just begun
On a blind journey where I can't get lost
Cause my eyes are crossed and I'm walkin in circles on the train of thought
And it's better to be abstract cause people interpret you differently
See what they wanna see
Recently everybody sees me
Til a moment ago when the air explodes
Apparently I'm after the fact
Just like that
But it couldn't be stopped
And in this defining moment maybe you can finally focus
On the things you failed to notice
And what the difference is
Between being alive and being able to live
For the first time do we ever see truth
In our own mind with our own eyes
And I thought of the perfect rhyme with a hook to go
But I never made it back to the studio
The tiniest thing can bring down the mightiest king
Cause a crown can bling but it won't save you
From the sound I bring
Welcome to O Top's awakening
You can bet that I'll make hip-hop with the time I got
And it'll be hard to stop
What goes through your mind and what stays in it for a hot minute?
Long enough for you to process the ridiculousness of what gives you stress
I am willing to bet that you tend to forgive and forget in this moment of death
I'm holding my breath; cause the air today is poisonous
How did it come too this?
Everything was perfect
Everything was perfect
How did it come too this?

I remember the day when my bright eyes faded away
