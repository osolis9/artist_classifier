Now-or-Never:Chris Styles
I'm holding onto something
I can feel it in my soul
Are you slipping through my fingers?
So tell me now, 'cause I really need to know

This is now or never
So take me in your arms
We'll be forever
Don't let us fall apart
Gotta hold it together
We can fly home

I'm deafen by your silence
More than you could know
Now I follow every heartbeat
As fast as I can go

This is now or never
So take me in your arms
We'll be forever
Don't let us fall apart
Gotta hold it together
We can fly home
We can fly home
