Adamantine:Ruste Juxx
The tricky thing about Adamantine man is that
If you ever manage to process that... liquid form
You got to keep it that way, keep it hot,
Because once the metal cools it's indestructible.

Yeahhh

Ruste Juxx, Brooklyn in this bitch, stayin' the fuckup
Yeah, kill the all town, and kill me.

I don't know how you think you got,.
Should you've killed yourself to save this town
Take a long walk on a short...
Then you kill'em with a really war...
Talking like I'm taking war...
I'm... that episode
Any week, every morn', for year'
... I'm a ball...

... from state to state...
Cut it up films from take to take
Break to break, goes to show

Ship fires like a clock 18
Two drums on my head all thing

... Kick the nast thing
... dirty demolition.

And ruff take money
