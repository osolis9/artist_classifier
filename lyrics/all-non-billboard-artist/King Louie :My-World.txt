My-World:King Louie 
(Feat. Jessie Reyez)

[Hook:Jessie Reyez]
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't feel a thing
Cause I let the music hurt
I don't hear a thing
No I don't hear your words
I don't know what to do
But I know that this is my world
& I don't feel a thing
Cause I let the music hurt
I don't feel a thing
Cause I let the music hurt
I don't hear a thing
No, I don't hear your words
I don't know what to do
But I know that this is my world and I don't feel a thing, yea
Cause I let the music hurt

[Verse 1: King Louie]
Bars are my tears so I cry alot
I don't got no fears
& niggas die alot where I'm from
We grew up finessing or you dyin broke
Teach his ass a lesson then we go & smoke, homicide
Shorties know how to kill, but they can't read
Niggas talk shit like they can't bleed
But niggas be snitchin singin to the penitentiary
Goldie with the pimpin
My bitches got me by a century
My name is louie
But I'm Tony, I invented me
Yo bitch been at my house
In her lingerie since yesterday
I don't hear that bullshit
Cause that money keep on calling me
Right now I'm with his bitch
But yo bitch keep on calling me
I just met the ho today
At the end of the day, she went all they way
Niggas [?] on em', pardon me
Kinda weird to call my pops on father's day
Since my mama raised me
She can get anything she want from me
My niggas crazy
They'll cut anyone I want for me
Granny told me I was a star
I could be any one I wanna be
& that's King, Tony
Yo bitch, on me
She call me
But she ain't lonely
When she with yo lame ass
She wanna be the boss dude
I don't hear shit
Pack too loud
Shawty was some blocks away
They heard it got too loud
Bought a Glock in February it's
Black & proud
You niggas bitch
Su yung gung jun thou
[?] steady calling, call it rush hour
Fucked a Romainian bitch, white power
I need more ice for my zan juice
I am a God, crocks my sandals
[?] A bitch, v12 samples
What are You sayin
I can't understand you
