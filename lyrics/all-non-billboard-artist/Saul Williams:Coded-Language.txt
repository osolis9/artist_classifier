Coded-Language:Saul Williams
Whereas, breakbeats have been the missing link connecting the diaspora community to its drum-woven past.
Whereas the quantised drum has allowed the whirling mathematicians to calculate the everchanging distance between rock and stardom.
Whereas the velocity of spinning vinyl, cross-faded, spun backwards, and re-released at the same given moment of recorded history,
yet at a different moment in time's continuum, has allowed history to catch up with the present.

We do hereby declare reality unkept by the changing standards of dialogue.
Statements such as "keep it real", especially when punctuating or anticipating modes of ultra-violence inflicted psychologically or physically,
or depicting an unchanging rule of events,
will hence forth be seen as retro-active and not representative of the individually determined is.
Furthermore, as determined by the collective consciousness of this state of being
and the lessened distance between thought patterns and their secular manifestations,
the role of men as listening receptacles is to be increased by a number
no less than 70 percent of the current enlisted as vocal aggressors.
Motherfuckers better realize, now is the time to self-actualize.

We have found evidence that hip hop's standard 85 rpm
when increased by a number of at least half the rate of its standard
or decreased to Â¾ of its speed
may be a determining factor in heightening consciousness.
Studies show that when a given norm is changed in the face of the unchanging,
the remaining contradictions will parallel the truth.

Equate rhyme with reason
Sun with season

Our cyclical relationship to phenomenon has encouraged scholars to erase the centers of periods,
thus symbolizing the non-linear character of cause and effect.

Reject mediocrity!

Your current frequencies of understanding
outweigh that which has been given for you to understand.
The current standard is the equivalent of an adolescent restricted to the diet of an infant.
The rapidly changing body would acquire dysfunctional and deformative symptoms,
and could not properly mature on a diet of applesauce and crushed pears.

Light years are interchangeable with years of living in darkness.
The role of darkness is not to be seen as, or equated with,
ignorance, but with the unknown, and the mysteries of the unseen.

We claim the present as the pre-sent, as the hereafter.
We are unraveling our navels so that we may ingest the sun.
We are not afraid of the darkness, we trust that the moon shall guide us.
We are determining the future at this very moment.
We know that the heart is the philosophers' stone.
Our music is our alchemy.
We stand as the manifested equivalent of 3 buckets of water and a handful of minerals,
thus realizing that those very buckets turned upside down supply the percussive factor of forever.
If you must count to keep the beat then count.
Find your mantra and awaken your subconscious.
Walk your circles counterclockwise.
Use your cipher to decipher coded language, manmade laws.
Climb waterfalls and trees; commune with nature, snakes and bees.
Let your children name themselves and claim themselves
as the new day for today
We are determined to be the channelers of these changing frequencies into songs,
paintings, writings, dance, drama, photography, carpentry, crafts, love, and love.
We enlist every instrument: acoustic, electronic.
Every so-called gender, race, sexual preference.
Every per-son as beings of sound
to acknowledge their responsibility to uplift the consciousness
of the entire fucking world.
Any utterance unaimed, will be disclaimed, will be maimed - two rappers slain.
