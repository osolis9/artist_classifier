Tonight im yours
[Tank:]
Oooh oooh
Zane:
(I can never do too much)
Yea, um, I know I been gone for a minute but tonight, I'm all yours

[Chorus 1x]
[Tank:]
Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way
Turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up 
Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours
(I can never do too much)

[Zane:]
Our whole relationship is based on trust
And for you I can never do too much
You, kept me secrets and held me down
Plus you, stayed loyal when I wasn't around
And I know it wasn't easy, I was never home
Concerts, videos, and you was all alone
We spent many talkin' on the phone
You started catchin attitudes
I heard it in yo tone
I used to tell I'll be back when I could
You think I'd leave my babygirl in the hood
I would never do such thing
I wanna show you what true love brings
Imma put you on a pedestal, love so incredible
Victoria Secret's candy thong so edible
Spiritual, mental, not just sexual
I'll deaden all my plans to get next to you

[Chorus 1x]
[Tank:]
Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way
Turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up 
Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours

[Zane:]
I made reservations at your favorite spot
Pull up, tip the valet at the parking lot
Got a table by the fireplace, candlelit
Tonight, we gone stick to the manuscript
Start it out with a bottle of Cris, followed by a kiss
I can taste your lip gloss on my lips
So, candy sweet with your bubble gum tongue
The type of stuff that keep a brother straight sprung
And I try to play the tough guy role
And hold back but I'm losing control
When it comes to you I can't explain how it feels
No more games baby, Zane is for real
You been askin' for quality time, now you got it
Anything you want you can have, think about it
I been caught up in the hype so long
Now you never spend your nights alone
Cause daddy's home

[Chorus 1x]
[Tank:]
Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way
Turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up 
Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours

[Tank:]
All the love that you deserve I wanna give
And tonight I'll show you its for you I feel
Everything I do is for you & I
So baby let's ride

[Zane:]
To the fellas
While you're out on the grind
Don't forget about your homefront
Spend some time with your lady
Or the next man will
If you dont treat her like a queen
You gone see what I mean
When's the last time you told her how you felt inside
Held her hand and caressed her while you looked in her eyes
Let her know that she's everything you need and more
For you my feelings are pure
And tonight, I'm all yours

[Chorus 1x]
[Tank:]
Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way
Turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up 
Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours

[Singer:]
I had some problems
And I didn't know how to solve them
Oh baby but you were the answer
I'll be giving you all my token
I'm your

[Chorus 1x]
[Tank:]
Girl tonight, I'm yours
Turnin' off my two-way
Turnin' off my phone
I'll tell my friends to leave so we can be alone
Clear my schedule up 
Cause tonight I swear I'm all yours
