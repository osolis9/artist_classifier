Point-to-B:Prefuse 73
The magic feeling
Never let me down
I got the greatest friend
That ever can be found

Across every river
Behind every tree
On top of every mountain
They're part of you and me

(One world)
One world
Now and forever
(Best friends)
Best friends
Loyal and true

(One dream)
One dream
That's side by side
There's nothing we can do
(We live)
We live always together
Sharing the same bright sun
You and me and Pokemon
