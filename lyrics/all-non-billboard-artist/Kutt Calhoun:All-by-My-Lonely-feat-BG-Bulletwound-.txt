All-by-My-Lonely-feat-BG-Bulletwound-:Kutt Calhoun
Niggas don't wanna see me shine
I swear to God as my witness, it happens every time
They hate my climb, and block my lime
But lemme tell you this here little light of mine, it's fine
I was born by my God-damned self
Way I see it, I'm a die by my God-damned self,
Lord willing, long as I be forgiven myself
I pray to God I'm not a burden for anybody else
Got my own two-step, keep my chin to the sky
All my so-called friends all done moved to the side
Got a drawer full of them bills, they pile sky high
Don't nobody give a damn and I don't care to ask why
That's why I be on a mission, I'm watching my own behind
My future is right in front of me, wifey is on my side
Middle finger to all you niggas who'd rather see me drown
They ain't like a nigga then, but they hate a nigga now
My game's too strong, my flow's too heavy
Ain't a thing slowed down since I first dropped B.L.E.V.E.
If this money's up for the taking, then you better never let me
Snatch it down by my God-damned self, I'm ready
Do it all by my lonely
My own family disowns me
Surrounded by a lot of phoney homies
Gone be, from me
Heyyyy
