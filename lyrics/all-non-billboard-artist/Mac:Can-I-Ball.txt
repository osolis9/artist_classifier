Can-I-Ball:Mac
Say Slim, look what's happenin' wootay
We goin take this here all the way from the Magnolia
Across Clayborne, do it like that, ya heard me, do it

Can I ball y'all or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall
Can I ball niggas or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall

To make this million I'm bound to left uptown to go get it
Once I get it, I'm a split it with those who I'm commited
Like who, my nigga Wop, my girl Storm and the rest of my click
Everybody else be on some oh you ballin' now, you ballin' now

Since you play me closer, I'm a get the toast, oh mark my word
Fuck em, fuck 'em if they don't know what's happen my rap
If a nigga know me, he don't know me no more
'Cause I don't hang in the same streets no more, I gotta condo

I lay low, chill, stay away from shit that get niggas killed'
Call me fake then my niggas will say that's trill
Check it, funny high hoes be calling me jiggy now
'Cause I gotta little jingle, mingle with the finest and sport diamonds

When I was broke I was skinny and full of shit
Now it ain't nothin for me to pull a bitch
I scratch off and I hear them hoes say he did that
Every bitch I fuck be saying I'm tryin to have your kid Mac I ain't with that

Can I ball y'all or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall
Can I ball y'all or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall

I'm a try my best not to let these niggas bring me out there
They know you beefing with the [unverified] and them niggas don't care
Who they kill, and tryin to be a millionare on the real
But I can't a from with that foolishness so I'm a chill

And just pass through the projects that I used to roam in
Tote the black and the steel chrome
And holler at trill niggas like Jim Stone and
No more hangin', no more slangin' pearls and crack pieces
No more fuckin' dog bitches carryin' deadly deseases

They burn your dick off, givin you aids through the rubber
I had to settle down with a boss bitch and now that's my lover
She down for a nigga
And when the situation get's heavy she lets loose rounds for a nigga

And if I don't come home she'll come blood hound for a nigga
That's the type of bitch I need, no drink, no smoke, no weed
Hoes label me a hot boy 'cause I just come home and I don't get D'd
But I'm a boss baby, I like to floss baby can I ball y'all, can I ball

Now can I ball y'all or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall
Can I ball y'all or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall

Now Soulja Slim, my nigga, my nerve, my partner, my wootay, my round
My ace, my dog, I was down even when you was on that ground
You camouflaged uptown that was some shit to see
So when they locked you up I continue the legacy

Now all these niggas claiming Soulja is you bout that ball
Would you die for me if a nigga pull up in that tinted car
I think you niggas sitting around waiting on my fall
Let a nigga ball, nigga let a nigga ball

Can I ball y'all or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all y'all, if y'all was waiting on my fall
Can I ball niggas or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck y'all niggas, if y'all was waiting on my fall, ya heard me, woah

Now y'all understand, now you understand
Macadon and Soulja Slim
In the process of B O O Cing, ballin out of control
Bleeding out of control nigga, ya understand

So, uh look, I'm a tell these niggas like this here
We bout to go get these motherfuckin' Rolexes shined up nigga
And go get our chrome shined up and we goin' ball ya heard me
They ain't goin' like that, they don't wanna hear no shit like that

They ain't goin' like that
But we ballin' out of control though
Bleeding out of control
We doin' them niggas like that so fuck it
