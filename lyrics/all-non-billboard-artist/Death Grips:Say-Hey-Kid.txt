Say-Hey-Kid:Death Grips
I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would

I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would

Happy's perfect
Perfect's tame
Tame and cashmere go together
Cashmere makes perfect better
John and Shelley, my people would never

Don't it feel good to drive a bus?
People need to get picked up
Pride your uniform and stunt
You do what my people would grunt

Don't it feel right to sell a ten?
People like to tell your scent
Pause the bus, put off your yell
You yell at my people would say

Hey

Come early if ya lonely
Say hey kid say hey don't you OD

Say, hey, don't you OD
Come play dead

Hey kid!
Come play dead I do what my people would
Because my people would
But only if my people could
I would if my people would Support, gravity, my people would
Support, gravity, my people would

But what are my people for?
Your wife has the lovely neck
But what would my people suck?
If they would I could I guess

I guess her neck's the best
Her neck's just the best
Hello there, hello there
I'm perfect now and then

John and Shelley are my friend
They know what my people for
They know your wife's neck's my cure
No question, I'm sure

Come play dead
Say hey don't you OD
Come play dead

Come play dead
