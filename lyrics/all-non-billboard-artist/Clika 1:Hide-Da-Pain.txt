Hide-Da-Pain:Clika 1
[Romero]
I'm high as a motherfucker
Just gonna smoke my whole life away

Chorus: G Money
I smoke the weed
Tryin' to hide the pain
Spendin' all of my time
Smoke my life away
You can feel it inside
Take a look at my eyes
Can you
Feel the pain
Mary, mary, take my pain away
We struggle in time
It's written all on my face
Take a look at my eyes
Don't you dare look away
Mary jane to maintain
Tryin' to
Heal my pain

[Verse 1: Romero]
Kickin' in the door with the double dawg, pump
Shotgun, trucha, comin' in, people screamin'
And pushin', I'm shovin', I'm buggin', I'm thuggin', I'm muggin'
Showin' no lovin' for you, where my cousin, now what (SHUT THE FUCK UP)
Bringing heat out the oven, they call me No-Good-For-Nothin'
I'm always huffin' and puffin', about to get into somethin'
And if you stompin', I'm jumpin' in, the Clika, I'm bumpin' it
New Mexico Lobo, ain't the fool to be fuckin' with
Igniting like dynamite, my beat is atomically
Your automatic AK-47, ain't no stoppin' me
Got the chronic, got it proper, G
I'm Romero, like (???), I'm a always be on top of things
I put the chronic in the bowl, take a motherfuckin'
Pull, out the motherfuckin' fool like a mystery (Know who?)
I'm a lobo, I'm a rebel, I'm a angel
I'm a devil, on the norte, on the sur, on the east side and the west
If you wish me all the best, I'm a keep you in the chest
See, you see me on the press, see, you see me smokin' stress
See, you see a loco blessed
I was never nothin' more, I was never nothin' less
Put my life on the beat, comin' live from the streets
Time to fill me up a drink, take a toast to the very upmost
Gettin' weeded til I comatoast
Mary, mary
All I weeded, I'm a get you blown
Home blown
All my road dawgs know
That I give it all I got
Always blowin' out the spot, 4:20 on the dot
Time to fire up a crop
Everybody puffin' on it when I'm blazin' up the chronic non-stop
So I'm a hit it on the drop, hold it in, let it out
I'm so motherfuckin' high, that I'm bleedin' from the mouth
Wrap my tongue up on the mic
I'm a smoke away my life
Tryin' to hide from the pain

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Bad Boy]
Smokin' weed on the daily
Waiting til Death says
Since the eighties, I lived in the crib full of babies
Left in the dark, was the spark, in the park
Walkin' with a strap, with nowhere to go, Mary
Mary Jane
Helped me to
Ease the pain
To maintain the gank, to take gain, start hustlin'
The dope, to change, to make thangs
Stop fuckin' with them hoes, get up, and get paid, homie
Get made
I got me a weapon to spray
I was lost for a day
Walkin' the streets with some heat and some hay
And ended up
Locked in a cage like a slave
Caught in a daze
"Funny as fuck," you could say
I got out and got blazed
Took a turn, lookin' up
How to change
Was tellin' a Bad Boy
Not to play, but
Mary Jane, along with the nuts to get brave
And the hopes to get saved
Got me a name in the gang I would kill for
Takin' my bullshit
To the grave
Nothin' but 702 blues, troops
In the '82 Coup deuce, gotta move
My attitude, screwed
Gotta get me some weed to get me through (Fuck that shit up, dawg)

Hook: Bad Boy
Smokin' with nothin' to do
Writin' and rappin' and shit
There ain't nothin' new
Livin' and waitin' til death do us part
For my dreams to come true

[Bad Boy]
Say it again

Repeat Hook

[Bad Boy]
Smoke some

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Doc Well]
From Tropicana to Bonanza
I'm attackin' motherfuckers
Like some brand form of deadly cancer
With a handgun
Throwin' tantrums whenever I go
More then a day without
Talkin' to Samson, like Half Baked
I'm smokin' at a fast pace
On a motherfuckin' blunt of that California skunk
In an instance, so you know I'm a get stuck
And you're gonna get struct
Cause I'm drunk and don't give a fuck, roll another
I'm already done with the first
You don't really feel the pain, you just pretend that it hurts
You haven't the slightest idea on how the planet works
There's way more to life than what you can read in a book
Chasin' skirts
Rockin' new shirts and put D's on your shit
I come equipped with a full .380 caliber clip
You ain't gotta be a doctor to see that I'm sick
A bitch ain't gotta know I'm rappin' to get on the dick
But it sure as fuck helps
Especially when I'm locked up
In the county with no money for bail
I'm Don Well, I rock well, my eternal restin' place is hell
So I don't care to play fair
Fuck the world and everybody on it
I'm so God damn bored with life that I'm yawnin'
I don't see the new sun dawnin'
In fact I'm pissed off
When I wake up cause I lived to see the mornin'
Fuck it, I hit longer than a cigarette
I live my life by the second with no regret
Like Rodney
I swear I get no respect
From these dumb
Motherfuckers til they get checked
On their chin
Now, chasin' death
Fuck runnin' from it
I feel haunted by the general public
Another critizin' people like me who stay blunted
Chase smoke and drink liquor all night, livin' toxic

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 4: Brown]
Ese Brown, steppin' in, with the Click
And we already in the game, loco to the brain
Comin' with the gangbang
Vocals, it's the motherfuckin'
Local boys, out makin' noise with your homeboys
Clika One up in their low toys
Now we're makin' more noise
Like hood niggas in a Rolls Royce
Only becomin' a street voice, spit the rhyme
With the gangsta poise and my closest homeboys
Are criminal minded with no choice, take a toke
And get the fuck out, struck out, spillin' your guts out
No heart, no doubt, I'm in the Caddy, gettin'
Smoked out
With the locs on
And I'm probably coked out, should I bring 'em out
With the gun shot (Shit)
Why not
Never listen to words in my verse, since I was cursed
To be the worst from the first day
The vato bursted
From the bullets I gave him in the
First place
Never disrespect the name
Clika One to the brain, same things
With the Mary Jane to maintain
Fuck the shame, I'm gonna swallow the pain
To the brain
With the 40 bottle exchange (Bullets are hollow)
We ain't promised tomorrow
So why bother
Crooked paths are hard to follow
When street life is hard to swallow (Light that shit up)

Repeat Chorus

[G Money]
I smoke the weed
Tried to hide my pain
You can feel it
Inside
Take a look
Can you take a look
Whoa, no
Mary, Mary, take my pain away
I feel it inside
Take a look
Mary Jane to maintain
Heal my pain
You will all light a toke
To fix my body
Can you, heal my pain
Can you feel me, feel me, yeah
