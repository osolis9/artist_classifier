Face-to-Face-Remastered-:Code Blue
He's making love while talking on the phone
To a woman he doesn't know
And she can't face him and say I love you
She's acting so detached such unexpected cool

Did I say too much
Did I speak too soon
With all my education
Still the words don't come
Am I getting old
Am I still too young
Want to have it now
Want to have it all

There will come a time
We will meet again
Face to face
Skin to skin

Said I'd never leave you
Left you there for dead
Said you never leave me
Your world and my world
They're not the same world
Can't see eye to eye

There will come a time
We will meet again
Face to face
Skin to skin
Face to face
Skin to skin
Heart to heart
Skin to skin
Heart to heart
Skin to skin
