Setting-Fires:The Chainsmokers
feat. XYLÃ˜
Produced By The Chainsmokers


[Verse 1]
Down to my last match fire I touch just to feel
Why is it easier to burn than it is to heal?

[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the cold you've been
I begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

[Chorus]
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Post-Chorus]
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Verse 2]
I've been looking for answers I don't want to hear
Chest to chest with you I'm staring into a mirror

[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the cold you've been
I begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

[Chorus]
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Post-Chorus]
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Bridge]
What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you
What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you

[Chorus]
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

[Post-Chorus]
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
