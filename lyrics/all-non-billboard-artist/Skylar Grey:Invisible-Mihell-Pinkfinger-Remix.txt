Invisible-Mihell-Pinkfinger-Remix:Skylar Grey
I take these pills to make me thin
I dye my hair, and cut my skin
I tried everything, to make them see me
But all they see, is someone that's not me

Even when I'm walking on barbed wire
Even when I set myself on fire
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
Every day I try to lock my past
Even though inside I'm such a mess
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?

Here inside, my quiet heart
You cannot hear, my cries for help
I tried everything, to make them see me
But every one, sees what I can't be

Even when I'm walking on a wire
Even when I set myself on fire

Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
Every day I try to lock my past
Even though inside I'm such a mess
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?

Sometimes when I'm alone
I pretend that I'm a queen
It's almost believable

Even when I'm walking on a wire
Even when I set myself on fire
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
Every day I try to lock my past
Even though inside I'm such a mess
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
