Feel:Zug Izland
I gave you everything, all I could give
It might not have been, the life you thought you'd live
I know it feels good, to have you by my side
Even though I know you could, just break my heart wide
I just have to ask you, one more time.
Did I make feel like number one?
Did I help you see like stars in the sun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like lifes just begun

It's like a puzzle, a piece that just fits
You never really needed to look for it
In your eyes I see my future and my past
And, I never really thought that we wouldn't last
I just have to ask you, one more.

Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I help you see like stars in the sun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like lifes just begun

The way I've seen, all the good times and the bad
Been waiting for the next part we never had
To the highest mountain, yeah I would climb
I just have to ask you, one more time.

Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I help you see like stars in the sun?
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like lifes just begun

Yeah, yeah! Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I help you see like stars in the sun? Yeah.
Did I make you feel like number one?
Did I make you feel like lifes just begun Yeah.~*~

I've seen the light and I've
seen the fate
And I walked away
Still I'm ok

I remember the pain inside
from the day when my mother died
Never went away
It's still here today

[Chorus]
Ya born alone
Ya die alone
And still we live on singing
Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow is a vision
But today
it's a bitch
Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow is a vision
But today
it's a bitch

And my baby he went to sleep
in his mother's arms we pray to keep
He shyed away
He never lived a day

Best friend call me up to say
with a gun in his hand said he's goin' crazy
Said you'll be ok
he still died the next day

[Chorus]
Ya born alone
Ya die alone
And still we live on singing
Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow is a vision
But today
it's a bitch
Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow is a vision
But today
it's a bitch

I stood in line
I've lost my pride
I've made the change
I'm a better man today

Death brings life
Still we try
To live a better way
Before your dyin day

[Chorus]
Ya born alone
Ya die alone
And still we live on singing
Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow is a vision
But today
it's a bitch
Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow is a vision
But today
it's a bitch
Yea yea
Yesterday is a memory
But today
it's a bitch

[fades]
Yea yea
Yesterday is a memory
tomorrow is a vision...
