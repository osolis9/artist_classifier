Serial-Killer:Dan-e-o
CHORUS: 
Serial kill-ah! Serial kill-ah! 
Serial kill-ah! Suicide, it's a suicide 
(Whenever you're fuckin' with the) 
Serial kill-ah! Serial kill-ah! 
Serial kill-ah! Suicide, it's a suicide 

I'm done, you niggaz is havin' too much fuckin' fun 
Makin' hip-hop one of the biggest jokes under the sun 
How'd you come through the door, since Ra kept it raw? 
I ain't gon' let you niggaz bastardize it no more 
See I'm wise and mature, I live by a code 
To only kill them rappers that's makin hip-hop erode 
They wake up, face up, lyin' on a table 
Niggaz say somethin', laid up, cryin' you ain't able 
To move, securin' the room in plastic 
Not a drop of blood left for forensics to bag shit 
But first I'mma sample it, like as if I'm producin' this rhythm 
Then make a brutal incision so that your eulogy's written nigga 
I'm roamin these streets, ownin' these beats 
If I catch you alone from your peeps I'm wrappin bones up in sheets 
Then bury you in Lake Ontario 
It's kinda scary knowin' there ain't no possible worse scenario 
There ya go! 

CHORUS 

Niggaz wonder where I been but I creep the streets nightly 
Sleep I keep sprightly, beast on beats tight be 
Insomniac wit' it, I visit like peeps sight-seein' 
You ain't wicked, don't know which niggaz can fight me 
Might be lurkin' in the back while you're rockin a set 
You can't see me, never resemble a composite sketch 
You 'bout to walk into death, first the syringe jook 
Who knows what 'gore may' be seen like a French cook 
You wake up surrounded by pics of your devious deeds 
Time to cease the disease of praisin' the weakest MC's 
Steady braggin' on some fake shit, you can't even say spit! 
Rhymes ain't on time, you behind, get a late slip 
'Bout to get your face split, you're wasted 
No more gettin' me up in arms, I'm no bracelet 
Dan-e-o will get sicker with every last kill 
Until you dumb niggaz stop askin' if I rap still 

CHORUS
