Bitch-Better-Have-My-Money-BBHMM-:Tiwa Savage
Bitch, better have my money!
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch, better have my money!
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
Give me your money
Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?
Louis XIII and it's all on me
Nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots, shots, shots
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
Bitch, better have my money!
Bitch, better have my money!
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch, better have my money!
Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin' wasted
Every time I drive by, I'm the only thing you're playin'
In a drop top
Doin' hundred, y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Louis XIII and it's all on me
Nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots, shots, shots
like blah blah blah
Bitch, better have my money!
Bitch, better have my money!
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch, better have my money!
Louis XIII and it's all on me
Nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots, shots, shots
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot
Bitch, better have my money!
Bitch, better have my money!
Pay me what you owe me
