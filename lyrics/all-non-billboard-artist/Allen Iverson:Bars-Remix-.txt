jewelz time 
jewelz time 

(I dont know who this is) 

For the year 2G the rap game changed for one nation 
jewelz name is slayin anything on this plain 
remains have found one of the best kept secrets ya heated 
you went platinum when it goes right 
so in the game you won you cheated 
my slang bangin ya need it 
man enough to pull a gun, be man enough to squeeze it 
(shots fired) 
die if ya dont believe it 
anything to do with ___ im gonna be with it 
hats off to the hardcore niggas, fuck the rest 
for my guess youre all useless, just talkin music 
never mistake me for a fake MC 
you got the wrong guy (fuck you) 
they call him CT (fool) 
get murdered in a second in the first degree 
come at me with faggot tendacies, youll be sleepin where the maggots be 
aint nothin count it, used to be factually 
but when its on I raise first automatically 
wont catch me as a victim in a rap casulty (c'mon) 
Dynasty raiders hit VA in the summer time (what) 
ten bentlys in one line 
gas in each hand 24 5s in mine 
snipers hittin niggas long distance for a rate 
sons and daughters 
one order and you'll be floatin in water 
bad newz home of the dynasty raiders 
one love to the old school niggas 
dead in the jail that tried to raise us 
even the ones who tried to blaze us 
but couldnt even graze us 
so them bitch ass niggas y'all killin dont amaze us 
im floppin im spittin..... 

(voice) 
hey yo

representin bad newz 
hey yo my homies set that shit 

Iverson (aka Jewelz) 
everybody stay fly gettin money to kill and fuck bitches 
im hittin anything in plain veiw for my riches 
VA's finest fillin up ditches when niggas turn bitches 
dyin for zero digits 
im a giant y'all admit it 
I know niggas who kill for a fee that'll kill your ass for free 
believe me, how you wanna die fast or slowly 
fast as a rolley, slow as a rolley - polley 
i bought your shit it was weak 
trashed it 
now you owe me 
all them hardcore niggas know me 
i dont knockin them, just gonna bust up in a muthafucka 
takin anything thats rightfully mine 
plus AK rifels and knives 
for Z cru thik designs 
with jewelz to shine all the time 
aint nothin sweet about this rate of mistake 
I got niggas where you eat shit sleep and beat ya meat 
die reachin for heat 
even leakin in the street 
niggas screamin he was a good boy since he was born 
but fuck it he gone 
life must go on 
niggas dont live that long 
but hoes in wigs when niggas think theyre head strong 
got niggas hollerin with jewelz dead wrong on this song 
this type of murder dont need no hook 
just 40 fuckin bars from the mouth of a crook
