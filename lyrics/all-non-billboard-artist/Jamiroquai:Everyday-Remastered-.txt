Everyday-Remastered-:Jamiroquai
Yes I do
Baby, maybe, we can
spend a little time
Together now that we're alone
So long I have been waiting
Now can't you let me
take you home

All these things we do
Will make our dreams come true
You want me, and
I surely want you
Tell me where to go
Tell me what I need to know
To take you on a little ride

Hold me, control me
Let me circumnavigate
your body, mind and soul
Like a seed from a flower
I can grow and you must know
Sadness, don't mean a thing
Cos, you and me girl,
you now we're in the swing
All the things that I want to get with
You on a midsummer night
In the evening light
(The) sweet evening light

All these things we do
Will make our dreams come true
I want you - you want me
I surely need you baby
And so far what we've done
Has made our lives become
Something more than
Evening light to make it right

All, all I want from you baby,
is sweet loving now
No, I know, yes, I know
I know what I want from you girl,
we can make it right
We can hold on to each other tight
Lose our inhibitions
yeah yeah yeah yeah

Every little thing we do is good
Every little thing you see is sweet
Every little part of you I'd like to meet
I want you girl, you know I want you
I want you in the evening light
