[hook 2x]
Loud lit
The chick with me lit
The club lit 
My wrist all lit
I'm lit

Party lit
U know im lit
Tonight we lit
My chain all lit
I'm lit 

2x 
I'm lit off da henny baby
Off da henny baby

I'm lit off da goose baby
Off the goose baby

I'm lit off da ace b
Off the ace baby

I'm lit off ciroc baby
Off ciroc baby 

[verse 1]

send them bottles in 
send them models in
less talking baby
and more swallowing
Or cancel her like nino
in the club wit a nino
all she want to talk about is pink and moschino
my swag on 10
had her wetter then nemo
my watch got radiation
it’s going thru chemo
respect my name like carlos gambino
or in come the wolves 
and out ya bambino
ace of spade sipping
lil homie you tripping
gucci ’s 800 
why the f is you ripping
See even Billie jean
Tried to trap up Michael
So now I hit and run
like I ain't pay my geico

and i aint even blast her

Why try to defeat us
When really you need us
And pardon my French
I'm in this bitch like a fetus
