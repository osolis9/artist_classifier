Fo-Sho-:Infinite Mass
f/ Helluva & T'Shun

Infinite Mass, Infinite Mass
hear the infinite sound that's platinum bound
Infinite Mass, Infinite Mass
Fo' sho' baby
with the sound that's platinum bound baby

(Rigorod)
Alwayz lookin' or sixteen bars in any club and get more twisted then
tung do an instrumental over dove song
with competition bloody like Mary
so they can take shots that makes them vocabulary
they pass out or recover in the corner
entitles me to ray so pass me my Corona
and through the years though stabilitys have become my occupation
and my business have increased
but my memories of those who gave me love
would never cease to exist cause part of my
pesent and future success in life
write this to the people that supported me and recognized
the work through hard times and nightmares
my parents and brothers have always been there
the fools tryin to get my bed in time
on the travels that I carried in my mind

Chorus (T'Shun):

I'll be down
[the infinite clique]
'til the end
with the infinite sound
that's platinum bound
I'll be down
[the infinite clique]
'til the end
Fo' sho baby
with the sound that's platinum bound baby

(Cham)
I try to put out ropes instead of throwin rocks
surrounded by money make all the sac kinda funny
sittin here on the throne all allone
never without my family would I have made it ever
on the low key that's why you can't see me
collaborating lawyers about my property
platinum bound straight through the nineties
I'll be down to the end for family and friends
listen, make sure everything is allright
before you sign your name on the contract for life
watch your homies back from day to night
in the club, alley coz you never know who might
try to find yourself a good woman
and take care of your own next day they might be gone
the infinite sound straight profound
representin' the real
[Now tell me]
ARE YOU DOWN?

Chorus (T'Shun):

I'll be down
[the infinite clique]
'til the end
yes I will
Fo Sho baby
with the infinite sound baby
that's platinum bound
I'll be down
[the infinite clique]
'til the end
Fo' Sho'
(Fo' sho baby)
hear the infinite sound that's platinum bound (baby)
it be ruff and it be hard sometimes
but if I got your back I hope that you got mine
I was going thru hard times you was around
that's why T'Shun and Tha Mass is puttin it down
with the infinite sound

(Helluva)
The beats pump ah
pimpin jet black Jaguar
'member when you said Hell you'll never make it ever
you say you know me from way back when
you was holdin down the do' and I couldn't get in
rogusly, you try to play baby bogusly
I admit I did some shit to make you notice me
and now it seems that we don't get down
style bein underground platinum bound baby

(Chorus)

[scratch]
