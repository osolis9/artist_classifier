Smokers-Anthem:Ash Kardash
Roll up, dank
Head shot, dank
Sit down, dank
Smoke that, dank
Pass out, dank
Wake up, dank
Smoke that, stank
Smoke that, stank

I'm exposed to some people that stay smokin' sweets
floatin' in the clouds lookin' down from their plane seat
Some people like bein' high just to float above their problems
takin' trips to the moon then comin' back to solve 'em
They stay in their own zone, dark room, listenin' to their loud tunes
Passin' back and forth the blunt, and puffin' on them doobies too
Barely gettin' high on one or two sweets,
But one or two sweets don't make sense to me, so

Why you babysittin' like one or two grams, I'mma show you how to fuckin' go ham
you go in on an ounce with your niggas and you blow
go in on an ounce with your niggas and you blow
Buy a few sweets then you clean the guts out, then you all take turns on the couch
You go in on an ounce with your niggas and you roll
go in on an ounce with your niggas and you roll

Roll up, dank
Head shot, dank
Sit down, dank
Smoke that, dank
Pass out, dank
Wake up, dank
Smoke that, stank
Smoke that, stank

Okay,
now ease your mind and listen to me.
I'm your apollo right now and I really need you to just listen to me.
If you plan on ever comin' down, I'll just make sure that you land appropriately
Cause if you just keep flyin' around, you may never come down indefinitely
I see you enjoyin' the high, I see the love in your eyes, I see the feelin' of
freedom is granted as soon as the high from the doobie arrived
That's how you really get high,
High as the moon in the sky, so obviously you're over influenced by what you updoin'
You thought you was blowin' the most until you heard me sing

Why you babysittin' like one or two grams, I'mma show you how to fuckin' go ham
you go in on an ounce with your niggas and you blow
go in on an ounce with your niggas and you blow
Buy a few sweets then you clean the guts out, then you all take turns on the couch
You go in on an ounce with your niggas and you roll
go in on an ounce with your niggas and you roll
Roll up, dank
