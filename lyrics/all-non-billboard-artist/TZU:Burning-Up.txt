Burning-Up:TZU
You might be on the street with a
Feeling that's got you beat and
Can't wake and cannot sleep and the
The pain is burning
Deep, Deeper now
But don't you worry

Hey, yeah,
I'm burning up I'm burning up
One more time, yeah,
Just burning up just burning up
One more time, I'm,
I'm burning up I'm burning up one more time
Over there
Yeah burning up yeah burning up one more time
Stand up if you hear me

All you have is what you need and the
Light is on now don't you see ever
Just wake up from your sleep brother
Get off that mercy seat
When you fall you'll find your feat coz I
Know you got something beating a beating
Got something burning deep in ya
Can you feel that fire heating up?

I feed the fire with the fuel of my words
I hold a match to my lips so i can sit and watch it burn
Your burden is mine man I've seen when you shine
And now i can't recognize nothing in you
I called you up to pursue you just brushed me off
I don't judge the drugs i just need you to stop
The cost is the people you've lost and you want
You got burnt chasing dragons from the madness they breathe
You're murdering dreams and that's just simple and plain
And it's the saddest thing to watch you nodding off on a train
And everyone who loves you feels that they are to blame
And now we watch on as you fade (as you fade)
I wanna shake every dealer and slap him in the face
I wanna take away your craving for just one more taste
I wanna see you get your life back on track and win
Coz if you conquer this you can do anything

Well it's a fine fine line
It's a fine fine line everytime

you'll all forgive him for all the people he's hurt
for every unkind word for every turn for the worse

Well it's a fine fine line
And it's hard to define, but don't you worry

Hey, yeah,
I'm burning up I'm burning up
One more time, yeah,
Just burning up just burning up
One more time, I'm,
I'm burning up I'm burning up one more time
Over there
Yeah burning up yeah burning up one more time

I am the voice of the people that you let down
I am the noise in ya head that don't make a sound
The cold sweats and the walls that you crawl around
The light shining on you when you're in your dark hour
I am the gunpowder that you start the fire with
The fire burning in your chest there beneath your ribs
I am the differences that you're now forgiven for
The hard worn lesson learnt that regret taught
I am the tympani the strings in your symphony
The things you do differently the things you'll do eventually
I am the dignity of overcoming pain
I am the flame and the blaze and the ash that remains
I am you and my name is change

Well it's a fine fine line
And it's hard to define, but don't you worry

Hey, yeah,
I'm burning up I'm burning up
One more time, yeah,
Just burning up just burning up
One more time, I'm,
I'm burning up I'm burning up one more time
Over there
Yeah burning up yeah burning up one more time
Stand up if you hear me
