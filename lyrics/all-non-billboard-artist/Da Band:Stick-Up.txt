Stick-Up:Da Band
Pull up right here, cut the car off
See I'm finna go in there
Everythang already laid
I'm just finna run in there and handle this
I just need you to watch the do'

Man, I got you I'ma hold you the fuck down
First take all your jewelery off, sit it in the car

Take the keys to the car, sit 'em in the seat

When we go in there just watch the do'
Aight

You ready?
Mothafuckin' ready
Aight fool, you got me, real niggaz do what they got to do
Yeah

Y'all muhfuckas freeze, take a seat on the floor
I'm approachin' the bank teller the bitch lockin' the drawer
Give me the codes to the safe and put yo hands to the sky
She shakin' because she know somebody 'bout to die

Now, keep yo goddamn hands off the panic button
Put the cash in the bag 'fore I damage somethin'
If the bitch try to act confused, get slapped, matter fact
Play it back on the action news

Ooh, I'ma act a fool, act irrational, the guard reached
For a gun I had to blast the dude
Fuck it if you blast then I'm blastin' too
Blow his ass to smithereens
The glock'll tear his ass in two

Heh, real niggaz gon' do what they have to do
We got it all mapped out we just passin' through
Heh, here come the boys in blue
And we came to wipe the bank clean, not enjoy the view

Nobody move, nobody get hurt
One false move put that ass in the dirt
Ooh, don't make me act a fool
Real niggaz gon do what they have to do

Nobody move, nobody get hurt
One false move put that ass in the dirt
Ooh, don't make me act a fool
Real niggaz gon do what they have to do

Ooh, don't make us act a fool
Real niggaz gon do what they have to do, yeah

You in there, this is the police
Please come out with your hands up and your weapons down
The building is surrounded there is no way out
Shit
Please make this easy on yourself and let the people go
The fuck damn

Gather all the workers put 'em in a circle
Not me I got kids
Heh, shut up for I murk you
Don't make me hurt you, you motherfuckers just form a line
Be patient, in time I'ma search you

Damn and the whole block flooded with pigs, ya dig
Reload the clips, you know what it is
I've only shot 4 out the clip it's 12 more in this bitch
And stay low if I'm shootin' 'cause I'm aimin' to hit

Fall out in broad day light, fuck police
Make that scene from 'Heat' look like Sesame Street, listen to me
Nah dawg, listen to me, if bad get worse
I'm goin' on a killin' spree, listen

Man you wild dawg, listen to me, I got a trick up my sleeve
Make my mission complete, check it
Take the steps to the top of the ceiling
Got a chopper waitin' for us on the the of the building

My man, thats a plan let me grab the million
Let's hover above the city over top of civilians
Come on
