RZA-Ode-To-Oren-Ishii:RZA
Ay yo
I wanna dedicate this song right here to Oren Ishii
Half Chinese, half Japanisie, half American, and yo
Oh what a species, a figure of perfection
She got the sinister cat eyes and little freckles on her complexion

Chief of the Yakusa but she's wicked like Medusa
And she got Crazy 88 killers that'd slice right through ya
Quick to chop a head off then wipe the blood off
A long-range sniper shot she busts, never let a dud off

You got a minute to pray and a second to die
You could see the image of the devil reflectin' inside her eye
But since she was a little girl, yo, she never would cry
She seen so much tragedy, let me explain to you why

She grew up on a military base where she had to face
The brutality of her mother, her father being erased
The blood dried from her teardrops on her cheek
You seen the smear spots

She sat, only watched
As the shogun sliced through her dear Pops, through his thick skull
Ya she's vicious, like a pit bull
And when it comes to hatred and revenge, she got a shit full

Revenge is the fire that burns inside your soul

Ay yo, she been bustin' up knee caps son since the age of 11
But fuckin' her enemy to death that was her favorite weapon
And in death you paid in hell, boy it can't be paid in heaven
You better get down on your knees son and start prayin' to the reverend

Bon Appetite, boy revenge is so sweet
Especially when it's served on a cold dish
But she has no wish but to cut yo day short
Like the winter solstice and the chance to receive a slight bit of mercy
From her was hopeless

Oren Ishii
Half Chinese, half Japanisie, half American, oh yeah
Oh, what a species
