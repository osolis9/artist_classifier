Oh, no
I hope the man upstairs isn't mad at me
'Cause I have one of his angels and she's here with me
Each time I see her precious smile when she spreads her wings
It takes me to a place where love meets eternity
Oh no, I'm not letting go
I don't wanna be alone in this crazy world
Oh Lord, I love her so
And I'll sacrifice it all to have her in my life
I found my girl, I'll tell the world
That Heaven is missing an angel
My dreams came true when I found you
Yes, Heaven is missing an angel
Not a day goes by that I don't thank God for you
He blessed me with my angel though I don't deserve you
Before I met you girl, lonely was my best friend
Now that you are in my life, I am stronger within
I can't wait to kiss my angel late at night
And watch her go to sleep until I see her rise, oh
I found my girl, I'll tell the world
That Heaven is missing an angel
My dreams came true when I found you
Yes, Heaven is missing an angel
All that I do is for you, me without you girl, just won't do
Oh no no, your love's all I wanna know, angel, don't you ever go
Life won't be the same without you, you, you, you, you, oh oh yeah
I found my girl, I'll tell the world
That Heaven is missing an angel
My dreams came true when I found you
Yes, Heaven is missing an angel
I found my girl, I'll tell the world
That Heaven is missing an angel
My dreams came true when I found you
Yes, Heaven is missing an angel
