Time-Bomb:Lake
I feel, like I'm sitting on time bomb baby
And it's going to explode
Yes I'm sittin' on a time bomb baby

Any day I know you're going blow our love
Pull the prime and then there'll be no more of me

Time bomb, time bomb gonna blow me high
Time bomb, time bomb blow me to the sky
Time bomb, time bomb gonna glow me high

You thought you knew it all but love was blind
And you turned on the light
You played such foolish games
And now it seems that you must pay the price
You lit the fuse and now it's only time
Before the bomb goes off
At least there's no surprise you know the score
Come in your time is up

Everyday I feel it ticking in my heart
Count the seconds here we go it's 3, 2, 1...

Time bomb, time bomb gonna blow me high
Time bomb, time bomb blow me to the sky
Time bomb, time bomb gonna glow me high

Feel, like I'm sitting on time bomb baby
And it's going to explode
Yes I'm sittin' on a time bomb baby
I feel...
