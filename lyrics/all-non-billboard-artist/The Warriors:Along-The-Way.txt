Along-The-Way:The Warriors
[FEATURING ANDREW VERITY/VENDETTA & RETALIATE/VOCALS]

 ONE DAY YOU WILL CEASE TO EXIST. NO BLURRY LINES OF CONSCIOUSNESS. THE ONLY THING LEFT IS VISION OF LIGHT, REMEMBERING MOMENTS FROM YOUR LIFETIME. REGRETS THAT YOU COULDN'T FORGET. THE REOCCURRING NIGHTMARE THAT YOU LIVED WITH. NO RECONCILIATION. ONLY TO DIE WITH NO SELF-PESERVATION. WE'RE ALL GUILTY. TIME WON'T STAND STILL. IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE YOUR WILL. LOVE AND HUMAN ERROR. NEVER WASTE A FOOLISH TEAR... ALL ALONG THE WAY. OF ALL THE WASTED YEARS YOU CAN'T TAKE BACK ALL THE PAIN THAT YOU ONCE FELT, AND NEVERMIND THE HEARTBREAK. IT WAS NEVER REAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. NEVER REAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE NEVER WAS A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. THE LIMITS OF YOUR TIME AS YOU PLANNED IT TO BE. TIME PASSED THAT YOU COULDN'T FORESEE. ALL ALONG THE WAY. LOVE WON'T LAST FOR ANYONE.
