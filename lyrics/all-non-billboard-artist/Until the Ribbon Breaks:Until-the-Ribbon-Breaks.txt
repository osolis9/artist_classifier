One way or another I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya
One way or another I'm gonna win ya
I'm gonna get ya get ya
One way or another I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya, I'm gonna meet ya
I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around

One way or another I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya
One way or another I'm gonna win ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya, I'm gonna meet ya,
And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hanging out

I'll walk down the mall
Stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all
Find out who ya call
I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around
