Gang-Racketeers:Conejo
This is straight war we the future winners
Goodbye muthufucker you was just ah beginner
City lock Semi Glock and I flow so gutty
Enemies get brittle five shots to the skully
You ah sucker in the street ese talking that garbage
I'm the illest homeboy but that's common knowledge
They acknowledge the bad blood between us
Troopers running vile so I came through the clean up
All these water down music I'ma keep my West
I'm ah South landnater situation addressed
Fucking growls of the triple OG's
Know I punctuate my point when I'm fucking with keys
The mix tape hard so fuck the hustle
Subliminal at me I spit greasy I buck you
Ese fuck you I get elicit fund
Ese beef with the clicka you get delt with guns

Ese gang racketeer felony cartel
Homie C.B.S news they preparing my cell
Small cartels time to save the wealth
But before it's all over I'll be raising some hell
Bootleg Franchise I had to muscle in
Silicify the link then bring my ring
See my wings I'm the real thing
Ese high profile they say coke is king

I don't needs em I just squeeze up
Homie liquor in my cup and the ganja get lit up
I got re-up and he gon' get dissed
Ese vato get hit in that black Mercedes
This gangland crimes hoodlum empire
Ese looking for the squealer that was wearing the wire
I master the game mug shot done changed
Cause now I'm the chief from the block up range
And I'm in and out of Vegas old world of darkness
Known for his sins and his many bosses
Ice man contract ain't no holding back
Ese first sight of you and I simply attack
And I ain't Giancana but I blast up shit
I put some money in your bank I could take that hit
I'm syndicated all over this bitch
My introduction to your ether the year Shady release

Ese gang racketeer felony cartel
Homie C.B.S news they preparing my cell
Small cartels time to save the wealth
But before it's all over I'll be raising some hell
Bootleg Franchise I had to muscle in

See my wings I'm the real thing
Ese high profile they say coke is king
