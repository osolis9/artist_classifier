No-Fear-feat-Asheru-Phonte-:Cool Cee Brown
[Verse 1: ~Phonte~]
Comparing me to you*
Is like Kingpin vs. Lookout
With my ink pen I done took out
Niggas like you lookin' scared in the corner with a book out
Back to your grill like Paul Wall at a cookout
+Sittin' Sideways+ like I'm tryin' to get a crook out
I can't teach and spell
Any rumor your motherfuckers try and miss spell
Cause we official
It's fish scale, nigga go and pull a hook out
Back to the block with another crowd banger
Make you wanna straight scream on a nigga like Kramer
The wars goin' on and your mind's the battlefield
Nigga won't last, dog you soft as Camomile
So we gotta be extraordinary
My poetry is food for the soul
Hoes call me County Culinary 
And that's so necessary
Tigalo, Cee Brown, Asheru, legendary
Yep

[Chorus:]
It's gettin' hot in here
I heard somebody licked two shots in the air
Violence, sirens, the cops is near
Fuck it though, I got no fear
I ain't goin' nowhere
Asheru, is you scared nigga?
Phonte, is you scared nigga?
Cee Brown is you scared nigga?
Fuck no
Me, run and hide? What the fuck fo'?

[Verse 2: ~Cool Cee Brown~]
When I spit it, better duck low
Somersault, tuck roll, cut throat
Ruthless, Jerry Heller, scary fella, turn canary yellow 
When they hear my accapella
Kick came in
He can hear it in his brain stem
Can't blame him
It's ignorant and niggerish yet so entertainin'
Cirque Du Soleil
Alert the old phase
Your daughters off the vodka tryin' to flirt with O.J.
We call that a screwdriver
If she's at the show then I'm puttin' in a new rider
Tell the promoter we want chicken and waffles
The brothel of top models 
Couple sacks, couple bottles
Tigga want a pork chop
Ash wanna smoke pot
Cee Brown wanna a couple fifths of cold scotch
Just thinkin', high school I got shitty grades
Now I hit the stage to get paid the get busy way

[Chorus:]
It's gettin' hot in here
I heard somebody licked two shots in the air
Violence, sirens, the cops is near
Fuck it though, I got no fear
I ain't goin' nowhere
Cee Brown is you scared nigga?
Phonte, is you scared nigga?
Asheru is you scared nigga?
Not a chance in my b-boy stance

[Verse 3: ~Asheru~]
In the world of rap 
You're either under valued or overpaid
The carbon copy image is overplayed
This is my house
Nigga your welcome is overstayed
Me afraid?
Tell 'em the ? is on my shoulder blade
Which means I fear no one
In the 007
Y'all either better beware, prepare for the rare shogun
To pick 'em off one at a time in a line up
Fuck a game
I need these wack niggas to step their mind up
So they don't gotta wind up
Bleedin' like the others
Meanwhile, I'm needin' brothers like me to step our kind up
Before the clock runs out and times up
Got gorilla with my tactic
Want in? Then sign up
And no need in askin'
When my next album come out
Cause that would kill the surprise and take all the fun out
Just know that when it does
Then it's back overseas on tour
Independent hustle settles the score
