Dementia-Cephalus:Inherit
Derangement
Progressive dementia, torture in the cruelest of forms
Man without a mind is a man no more
Fading into emptiness
Personality traits are decaying away
Psychological distress manifests as memory fails
Soul extraction

Neurological degeneration, delusions
Disease pathology tangled brain tissue
Brain lesions
Episodic flashes, all that's left of a life once known
Wandering, confusion, apathy

Final place to die, its your room-you've never seen before
Many crying faces not one of them do you recognize
You don't wonder why, loss of cognitive ability
You will die helpless, not knowing who you are
