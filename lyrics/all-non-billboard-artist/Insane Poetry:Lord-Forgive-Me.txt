Lord-Forgive-Me:Insane Poetry
Lord i respect my life
Doing wrong
Im just asking for some redemption
Can you help me out?

Moma forgive me for all this hell im in
That's why im confessing the truth to my reverend
Im telling him that im severing my ties with guys
i thought was better friends
Stab me in the back
They were never friends
Who could you trust?
The struggle never ends.
Thats why im up late nights puffin head medicin
Nothing but nigga thugs drugs and mexicans
resting in this hell that im resting in
And trick and chance
And checkin ends
The best of friends turn foes watch them turn hoe
Nigga as drove burn slow
Niggas will kidnap your next to kin
bumping his gums like a female full of estrogen
im just a specimen
im living proof hell exist
Tell his bitch if she aint sucking dick of the whole clip get her throat slit
No shit
Im hopeless

Cus my niggas will pull their toes quick for the dough shit

Lord forgive me the son has said
Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right

But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in

Lord forgive me
your son has said

Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right
But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in

Lord forgive me
I was supposed to be a architect
Now i walk the streets with the mark of death
Learn how to spark a tech
Its hard to step on these cold ass streets
Better hold that heat close
n peep those niggas
in cheap clothes shoot niggas like free throws
when the heat blows with slugs that eat hoes
Like lesbians that eat holes and your flesh burning
these bitch niggas for kilos and keep earning
them c notes is lethal turning bricks to chips
swervin whips with chicks was the dream to get cream
but shit seemed like it'd never crack

Seventy pounds of weed ten keys and better smack
wrapped in black balloons was crack and shrooms
got the fiends going apes like black babooms
Real shit is 1989 im tryin to survive and do music through these crazy times

Lord forgive me the son has said
Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right
But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in

Lord forgive me
your son has said
Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right
But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in

Mama forgive me
Im tryin escape all this madness
For all the shit ive done i should receive a thousand lashes
dumping blunt ashes
outside at night were the air is cold
that is why i bear my soul
It's the truth
Nothing fabricated but the fact is hated
ejaculatin pistols for real this is the deal
of brystol and camill we summon up the wickedness

Loading up the guns & running up in the businesses
pulling heat on the owners cus they owed us the loot
its hard to belive but few knows the truth
Damn constant suffering struggling

plus drugs n gin had me stuck all stupid bout to fuck off the music and the gift
i was giving for a long trip to hell or a long bid in prison which is
hell itself the pain heart wrenching

cleansing my soul

I need redemption
Lord forgive me the son has said
Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right

But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in
Lord forgive me
your son has said
Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right

But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in
Lord forgive my bad times im dropping the fat rhymes
but when bad times sits shit i gotta pack nines at times niggas wanna test your shit
im strap mines
so niggas had vest to get
undress you quick
Pop goes if i gotta squeze like nachos
i dont feel right without the cheese
but when good times hit (shiet)
it aint about the G's

its livin my life just surrounded by my seeds
cus i love my little nigga wanna mimic pops
But when the shit gets hard thats when the biscuit pops
see I don't game bang n slang cane and niggas know it

i just maintain & break pay when i flow it
What i look like claiming anything but the breeze
straight nigga for life
I sip the hen and puff the weed
Come fuck with me homie
Cus im only out the bubble

having good n bad times
Cus I'm caught up in the struggle
Lord forgive me the son has said
Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right
But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in
Lord forgive me
your son has said
Been astray all my life livin wrong like it's right
But its my life I gotta rep it to the end
Hope you keep the gates open tryin to find my way in
