Conquer:Armageddon
Descend to the depths of the unknown stale sunless cave
Daylight dissolve in the darkness surrounding
Enter the maze

Reveal to me projections of humanity
The will to be conqueror

Exhibitions of imitation
Plasmoid mimicry
Conjuration

Lead me to your cavernous theatre omnipresent domain
Show me all what you think that I am in the sub terrain

Reveal to me projections of humanity
The will to be conqueror

Deep underground gatherin vast illumination
World above, victim of full elimination

Invade my mind with memory of a past
I cannot comprehend

Deeper and deeper
Deceive me, destroy me
Electric controller
Sedate me with a fantasy of life

Reveal to me projections of humanity
The will to be conqueror
