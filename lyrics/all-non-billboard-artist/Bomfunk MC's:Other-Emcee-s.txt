This is DJ Security reaching out for
Bomfunk MC's, DJ Gismo and B.O.W
They've been spotted at F.K.
I repeat, surround the area
Code 10-5, code 10-5, surround the area now

Other emcees can't swing with us
'Coz we are the crew that's rocking non-stop
We shake you off like electric shock
'Coz we are the crew that's rocking non-stop
And we gotta funky song, so come on, baby, sing along

Keepin' it thrilled, never coming out cheap
Locked the door down just like Kool Keith
Got mad bull, got the highest feet
But the media bowl, it's just we can swing

Rock with they honeys and roll with the creeps
Only sucker punks get treated like leech
Down with the Bomfunk you have to guarantee
That we rock the crowd so viciously

Giz is the Wiz behind the dopest beats
Chuckin' while I'm rockin' to all you party peeps
Up flying all time but breaks are all we need
So once again have you been boomin' in your Jeeps

Balling, calling for all ya funky freaks
Like it or not, this is how we proceed
Roll the Rizla got some left over leaves
Light it up, huff and puff and just ease

Take a ride and watch the honeys
Feelin' good like you should therapy
Got what it takes, yeah I got the necessary
Ingredients to rock the house, very

Unique with the style, skills and techniques
Not just momentarily but week after week
