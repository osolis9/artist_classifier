BIGFOOT: We don't give a fuck about your twi**er followers or choreographers
We're hired goons slang tycoons bar reservoir bottomless
Wax crate magnate rappers aint stopping us
We don't even listen to your emo writtens
You see our mission is complete demolition
I'm an oil spill shifting through your fragile ecosystem
And you're just another one of many millions of organisms
Swimming through the shit
What a pitiful existence...
CIECMATE: Aint no questioning
I takes the best of em and make a mess of em
Messing with Ciecmate is the death of em
They're less than men...
I'm getting over you aint getting in
So notify your next of kin you know we hype like Ephedryn
Giants like the Nephalim
Silence with your pestering
And fake pleas too coz HG crew's def to them
Peace to my BTE bretheren
Deading em, on some Nikola Tesla shit
Ya'll are Edison...
TORNTS: Drop my name in a convo better watch ya mouth
I live for this shit n spit for the fuckin louts
In the spots where ya nightmares are unspooling
I'm Valhalla bound off the glory n looting
Nothin to prove, whole lot to extort
Export you, vessels into a dead port
Imitators copy up, so pathetic
No heart cuz, crying for a field medic...

BILLY BUNKS: I shit on your meal and piss on your garnish
Sodden the leaves bon appetit roll up my sleeves then sink on a barmat
HG, you rappers are paisley patterned and margarets
Snack on a parsnip
You muppets
Your Frank Koz i'm more rank cos
That whore had all that snoz i hit it regardless
You hid in the garden n piss in your garments
I'm drunken again cos i could afford it
Heard they're packing a morgue out
Shout out to all you aspiring corpses...
MURKY: Hired goons firepower to wipe out your platoon
Your entire crew suck dick and die soon
We've been getting fuckin sick and tired of you
Your deadline to leave town expired at noon
i'd get to hopping cuz
Pull them stockings up
You don't want us to surround posse up and come door knocking blood
All you've ever done is copy us
What come rougher than a HG posse cut...
DIEM: Living per diem's had me chasing them dollars notes
Change in my wallet feel strange when you own them gold
Chains and don't floss 'em
One life one shot so make something of it
If it don't give back to ya take something from it
Not your piece of cake so break something off it
It's always been basic logic
If it aint true then say nothing of it...
