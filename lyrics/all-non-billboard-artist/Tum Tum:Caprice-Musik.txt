Caprice-Musik:Tum Tum
Huh 
Hey 
(Chorus) 
Candy drippin 
On the chevy 
Caprice classic, 
Already 
I do the fool 
Watch me clown 
It's dat caprice music 
It goes down 
(Chorus) 

So fly not a wrinkle, 
Hop up in the Chevy 
Work the wood like my single, 
Dippin and swirvin 
Me and loc ya herd me 
Spinnin thru tha grove 
Cocked up on 24's 
Heavy on da net 
You know me 
So many chains on I'm bout to OG 
350 what it is 
I see u gripin when that? get big 
I be stuttin on dat ass 
Screen up pop out the dash 
Beep beep who got the keys to the caprice(neeroom) 
4/50 engine is obese 
Pull up pulled by 25 freeks 
I play for keeps 

(Chorus) 
(Chorus) 

Television wood wheels 
Sun roof push back 
Take boys to school on these slabs 
I'm a class act 
One boppa, 
Two boppa, 
Three boppa, 
Four 
Welcome to the chevy when I let up the doors 
Sippin and smokin 
Gotta pass that 
Take five puffs then pass it right back 
Noise my protected 
TBG's up 
53 B.I.G. 
D-D-D-D-Double up 
Gangs all here 
Leather on the chair 
Aint nobody flossin like this I swear! 
Presidential tint 
Bang in the trunk 
Pistols everywhere got me fuc*ed up 
? drop the beat 
I lace the track 
I'm a fool wit it (fool wit it) 
Like twisty black 
Wip game vicious 
My car look delicious 
So much candy on the car 
It's re-goddamn-diculous 

(Chorus) 
(Chorus) 

One boppa, 
Two Boppa, 
Three boppa, 
Four 
One boppa, 
Two boppa, 
Three boppa, 
Four
