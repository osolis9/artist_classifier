Only For You
(lew/graham/outten)

Phil:
I've been waiting just for a chance
To make you notice me

Lee:
May sound crazy but i...
I know just what you need
Roger:
A little bit of talk, a little bit of smile
A little bit of fun, a little bit of laughter
Just a little old fashioned love

Chorus:
I'd swim the ocean deep...only for you
A guardian angel while you sleep...only for you
I'd walk a hundred thousand miles to make you smile
Whatever it takes i'll do...only for you
Just for you...

Roger:
Are you with me girl, are you listening?
I want you with me girl but i'm not insisting

Lee:
I know it's funny after all this time
I'm letting you know what's on my mind all the time

Phil:
A little bit warmth, a little bit of wine
A little bit of dine, whatever comes after
It's all about us...oh!

Repeat chorus

Only for you...i'd steal a star out of the sky
Only for you...i'd take a gamble with my life
Anything you want from me
Girl it's you i aim to please
My love for you is guaranteed

For you i'd swim the ocean deep...only for you
A guardian angel while you sleep...only for you
I'd walk a hundred thousand miles to make you smile
Whatever it takes i'll do...only for you
