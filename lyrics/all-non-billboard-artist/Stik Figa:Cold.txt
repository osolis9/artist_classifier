Cold:Stik Figa
This game, this world (repeat)

Ain't letting a sucker disturb my sleep
Say it to my face if them words is deep
Or I can't even take it personally
You dealing with issues internally
He talking so tough wouldn't hurt a flea
Some of them rats even worse police
Got money to make ain't concerned with beef
Got babies and family I work to feed
You dealing with giants I'm Hercules
Grown folk talk wait your turn to speak
Pull down your skirt take your purse and leave
And get off my dick, probably hurt your knees
Put in the work and I earned my keep
Four-alarm blaze emergency
He ain't getting burn and his verses weak
So why they be calling him 3rd Degree?
Still sucker free with the sucker repellent
You ain't the only one in touch with a felon
Big dog in the yard and you tucking you tail in
You tough as a titty, tough as your nail is
Man who is you telling? I'm telling the truth
You tell on your niggas then fail to produce
No XXL but excel in the booth
Beats in the coffin and nails in the roof

These niggas is petty bro
We fonkin' then let me know
Then back to my schedule
Taking it slow chasin' fetti tho' (repeat 2x)
This game, this world (repeat 2x)

These suckas be lying bout whipping the work
These suckas be lying bout flipping a bird
Say that they pimping ain't living a word
Say that they balling like Pippen and Bird
They keep on lying bout this and the third
These suckas they really just get on my nerve
You ain't from the bricks and you live in the 'burbs
Claiming these hoods and ain't been to the turf
Boy you need Jesus man get to the church
Boy you need Jesus just get to the church
It's twenty-sixteen just admit you a nerd
Twenty sixteen just admit you a nerd

These niggas is petty bro
We fonkin' then let me know
Then back to my schedule
Taking it slow chasin' fetti tho' (repeat 2x)
This game, this world (repeat 2x)
