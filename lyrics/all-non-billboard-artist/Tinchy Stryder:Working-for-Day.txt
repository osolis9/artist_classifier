Yeah, look
Yeah, it's a cold world that we're living in
Look, blacks don't work for the minimum
Wage, but shit ain't changing
So we gotta stay strong, F giving in
And I know what my people went through
Take one look, you can see that I'm vex too
Look, it was all whips to the backside
Big chains round wrists, no bling in 'em
And they wonder why mandem are pissed off
It could be a shot or a person, we're licking 'em
Bagging up eighths in the yard then we're licking 'em
True story Strydes I be giving 'em
Black leaders I'm bigging them up
'Cos they went through all that long for the future
??? ??? ??? ???
Next time round know yourself in the future

Before the days of Martin Luther
Malcolm X, black people struggled so hard
To a different extent
Like being shipped from the motherland
Stripped, caged, raped, mis-treated
And beaten all the way to another life
Given new names like Sally and Dan
Brothers and sisters being separated
Getting sold off for less than a pound
Life back then was a struggle no doubt
Suicide was committed in a hurry to get out
'Cos people knew what time it was
If you did try holla or shout
New day now and it still ain't easy
Black people are still on a greasy
Grind, who knows, will it change in time?
Oi Strydes, do you think it will change in time?

Look, I learnt my history, not from school
And life ain't easy for blacks
Working hard, can't even relax
That's why I'm yeah I got my back to the wall
That slavery shit ain't fair man
And, look, I'm on some pay me shit
Swear down, don't try play me, please
I'm about my P's so there man
And I ain't tryna stay at the bottom of the food chain
Nah dead that talk, that was back then
Me, I rep for my people, I back them
Believe when I tell you I mean it
Learnt my history, not from school
And life ain't easy for blacks
Working hard, can't even relax
