Sore-Loser:Extra Kool
Two thousand and eight, Westword's best of Denver,
On June 25th, the Dirty Lab's first contender, they
Played "The Green Green Grass" when they first said
My name, it's just me and seven hopefuls, fingers
Crossed what a shame, and the winner is? not you
Extra Kool, my jaw hit the ground, man I felt like a

Fool, there was shame all over, from the eyes to the
Socks, but I'm Denver's best rapper from the 1600 block,
It's just me and Doctype, cold walking out the Blue Bird
Hands in our pockets like a bunch of sore losers, I was
Kicking rocks all the way to Dom's car, I guess I'll
Never make it big, I guess I'll never be a star...
