The-Wild-Life:Outasight
Got Swagger like Jagger
Big french palace
Damn that's tight
Clean like McQueen
2 pinky Rings
Damn that's bright!
Moves like Brown
Buys every round
What you're having tonight?!
Got a car like bond
Ladies on the arm
Get ready for the WILD LIFE!

Yeah! Been a long time coming
Old school Chevy with my windows down
Spent a long time running
Black shades on and my radio loud! Yeah!
Damn it feel so good
Rollin' thru my old hood, how's that sound?
Sound like whaaat? Okay now.

So, you're ready for tonight?
The flashing lights?
Gon lose your mind?
I've already lost mine
So you're ready for tonight?
Don't feel nice?
To lose your mind
Get ready for the WILD LIFE!

Got a tux with fur lapels, aviators
Leather driving gloves, winged tipped gators
Bevery hills, '58 Mercedes
Louie bag packed, I'm on permanent vacation

The night still young
You can be Marilyn, I'm JFK
Got a room with a view on pacific waves.
So, you're ready for tonight?
