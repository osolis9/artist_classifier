Lord-Have-Mercy:Backbone
One time

SWAT's, drop-tops and 'gnac
Lil-bitty killas on the block, cock back the gat
Can't a day go by, one of these villains don't die
Won't try to fight this feelin', this concrete thang
It thrillin' niggas, it's killin' for nothin'
Meanin', niggas is livin' for less, I guess
That I'm bring it to ya like it I S, the rest your 'sposed to know
See crime, that get'cha time, to the do' slick

When you hit 'em, get 'em
But keep yo' name up out they system
'Cuz that there could sho' fuck up the rhythm of thangs
Called up, charge it to the game
No your sittin' downtown tryin' to explain
Simple-n-plain, but they ain't finna be listenin'
You pre-trial detain to yo' co-sentencing
(Uh huh)
This situation keep ya tied in a knot
Lord have mercy on the SWAT's

Lord have mercy on me
This is just how it's gone be
Niggas dying daily on them same corner that pay me
But that's the only chain I'm gon' see

Lord have mercy, on me
I'm doin' the best that I can
But it's hard in my front yard
It's do or die out here, ya understand?

I done seen these same, lil-bitty niggas squeeze
Lil-bitty triggers, now these
(Uh huh)
Lil-bitty niggas is, lil-bitty killers
(Uh huh)
Couldn'ta been no more than thirteen
(Uh unh)
Supplyin' fiends, shorties strictly stressin' dirty
(What?)

I sit on the porch and watch 'em flee from the police
But the nighttime blind, and ain't no eyes on the streets
(Shh)
First law of the concrete
Better, never ever repeat, nothin' ya seen
(Uh unh)
He said he had to make a killin'
(Uh huh)
That's how it go whodi, ride and take a livin' fo' sho'

He say he kill and kill again, he'll kick in the do'
(Yeah)
Keep the lick, he trick a milli into mo'
(Yeah)
Nobody wit' him, he so low, when he creep through
(Uh huh)
Ride a glass Chevrolet, damn near see through
But they all fall 'cuz he learnt to walk
But he never learnt to crawl, have mercy, Lord

Lord have mercy on me
This is just how it's gone be
Niggas dying daily on them same corner that pay me
But that's the only chain I'm gon' see

Lord have mercy, on me
I'm doin' the best that I can
But it's hard in my front yard
It's do or die out here, ya understand?

I get it in, I put the chamber under yo' chin
I play to win, stingy, I don't have no air to lend
I'm standin' still, talkin' 'bout I'm grill
Cee-Lo Seville and steel real
Only millimeters away from my meal
Mighty knife, just enough not inconsiderate ice
You're contemplatin', contestin', please consider it twice
'Cuz I'm connected with the guy left after the drop of a dime

Or roll or roll down a bat, wonder what blow your mind
I'm heavyweight and Front Street Skeet
Got the snorters geeked-up and they keep runnin' back to the plate
We get it on, get it out the pot
Get on the block, and get it gone
Raised up out of the factories, and then we sit it chrome
Ya won't show, get out doors even if it's ice-cold
And slice O's as the dice rolls, shit
And may Lord have mercy on your hustlin'-ass soul

Lord have mercy on me
I'm doin' the best that I can
But it's hard in my front yard
It's do or die out here, ya understand?

Lord have mercy on me
This is just how it's gone be
Niggas dying daily on them same corner that pay me
But that's the only chain I'm gon' see

Lord have mercy on me
I'm doin' the best that I can
But it's hard in my front yard
It's do or die out here, ya understand?
