Pictures:Illy
Footprints in the sand, 
change of plans
make a new one, take my hand.
We're young, we're live,
chasin' the memories,
not enough time.

So i keep a picture in my wallet of you,
you, you, you, you.

Footprints in the sand, 
change of plans 
make a new one take my hand.
We're young, we're live,
chasin the memories,
not enough time.

So i keep a picture in my wallet of you, 
you, you, you, you. 

White sands,
crystal waters, 
can you imagine a world without borders.
Imagination don't cave to gravity, 
these dreams pale this insane reality.
Let the pressure come, 
we shine like a settin' sun,
like the good times never done.

Snapshots with fella's in Prague,
or a beach in spain, umbrella in the glass.

Board shorts, long necks, cruise through the night,
summertime cowboys do what they like, 
move like the tide, 
sure as there's blue in the sky, the youth got my future on side.
Heard pictures a thousand words but i guess that shit aint about a verse, 
so i made an album of photo's and album of music and cant figure which comes first 

Footprints in the sand, 
change of plans.
Make a new one take my hand, 
we're young, we're live 
chasin' the memories 
not enough time.

So i keep a picture in my wallet of you,
you, you, you, you. 

I leave my footprints in the sand, 
change of plans,
make a new one,
take my hand.
we're young, we're live,
chasin' the memories,
not enough time.

So i keep a picture in my wallet of you,
you, you, you, you.

Yeah, from behind dark shades
watch in the skies, man.
Like the world in the future in my hands
what more can a young man ask for?
Good mates and stamps in a passport,
light joints on a lonely beach,
with a beer and a feed while my hometown sleeps.

its as real as it gets
i cant fake a thing
i moved on but still start to take it in
i swear don't care where im at
i'll always have time for a laugh with the lads
i keep memoreis cloes to my cash so im never too, too focused on that.

and look, i heard pictures a thousand words but i guess that shit aint about a verse, 
so i made a album of photo's and album of music and cant figure which comes first
