I'm Rare I'm Rare
check the snap back
I put us all on the map ya atlas
drop that drop that low low
and make that ass clap
I got the world on my shoulders no back pack

(Tay Krew) verse 1:

Im that new kid on the block
with my hand on my crotch
and Ive been racing to the money cause the moneys at the top
got that new whip in the lot cause I've been signing on them dots
And I'm addicted to this life... ill die before i stop
cause me verses all the rest is something that you cant compare
I've been killing y'all with talent that you never knew was there
You hate now that I'm a star but wasn't when i was a square
I swear
a real nigga is something that so rare
cause fame brings money and money brings friends
I just hope i haven't changed by the time it all ends
I've been
on the grind getting mine all the time
i work harder then the rest so im never left behind
remember when you doubted
told me i should quit and I actually thought about it
no power unless i allow it
but now I'm doing shows getting paid like the pros
and i ant even gotta say it I'm sure that the fans know

(Blox) verse 2:

I'm different... you ain't as rare as me
fly as the air she gave the best of her memory
brain psychosis, romance telepathy
I'm a like extra expected to be like ecstasy
what up West High yeah
check my performance now
bitches get shut down to late to be a hoe now
married to the music only string is a Que stick
only ring is the money on my cell bitch
selfish
I ain't a savior
I ain't a caption planet
Captain of the pirate gang put your hand by your eye damn it
yeah i demand it
but respect all of my fan base
these rappers ain't hot they fell off worser than Myspace
who you to judge
who you to think you iller
you half ass'ed all summer and bull shitted all winter
I've been on the grind sicker some say I'ma go getter
my goal is the gold
but for you to remember me forever

(Tay Krew) verse 3:

I perfected my craft this life is only for the skilled
you better know what game you playing before you step on the field
take my time with all these women
never let my feelings build
cause i heard a broken heart takes a long time to heal
come to find out
niggas really hate to see you shine
thought that y'all would of respected a young nigga on his grind
but respect in my citys something that i gotta find
i mean look at what ive done in just a short amount of time
18 getting money but you already know
what we do when we alone
ya man ain't gotta know
cause i handle my high
work through my lows
old friends turn against you
but that's just how fame goes
