The-Overly-Dramatic-Truth:El-P
(feat. Daryl Palumbo, Camu Tao)

[Verse 1:]
I became for you when you would ask, telepath
Your to young to ask out loud, I'm to old and I know that
I can talk like you've not heard, I know weapons, you think words
I expose you to these terms, you still chose to roll on her
Have to work but I'm so fast, your so open, I'm so crass
I'm to weak to hold that back, you still thinking tree will last
Can't imagine of my past, I just can't explain all that
I wish I could trade your place, so romantic full of faith
I must spare, I must learn, I refuse to be your first
First to put you in your place, first to make you speed your pace
I'm a man now, good or bad, your a girl still, good for you
Don't think this don't make me sad, this is something I must do

[Hook:]
Keep your own time, leave me be, I'm tryin to spare you
Tryin to be? melodic, man on fire,? long gone, all desire
Fuck you raw now, it's my fault
Fuck you raw dog, I can't stop
Should've listened, should've left
I can't stop unless you jet
It's so simple, open head, I will knit my savage threat
Help me help you, walk away, leave this on amazing grace
You don't know from pure disgrace, you still think I'm here to save
I'm not even really here, I can't give what I can't take

[Verse 2:]
What a ride, what a slide under the door, what a score
You think I'm a genius, I know I'm a whore
What a time, what a climb in for our lives, whats in store
You seen lit forever, all I see is war
I will pull your hair back, fuck you on the floor
Pour myself into the act, pour myself, oohoo I'm bad
Cause I know these magnets end, but telling you the truth is sad
You deserve the ignorance and bliss that I still wish I had
Don't you let me keep you here, don't ignore my greatest fear
I need you to not need mem you need not believe just flee
I will put myself inside you, find some way to run and hide you
I can't be responsible, do as I say, not as I do

[Hook:]
Keep your own time, leave me be, I'm tryin to spare you
Tryin to be? melodic, man on fire,? long gone, all desire
Fuck you raw now, it's my fault
Fuck you raw dog, I can't stop
Should've listened, should've left
I can't stop unless you jet
It's so simple, open head, I will knit my savage threat
Help me help you, walk away, leave this on amazing grace
You don't know from pure disgrace, you still think I'm here to save
I'm not even really here, I can't give what I can't take

This is not my ego talkin, I know I'm no perfect raw
And I do love the way you lay there, I do like the way we talk
Maybe I'm just condescending, maybe this thing isn't wrong
Maybe you should lay right there, put your hands up in the air

[Hook:]
Keep your own time, leave me be, I'm tryin to spare you
Tryin to be? melodic, man on fire,? long gone, all desire
Fuck you raw now, it's my fault
Fuck you raw dog, I can't stop
Should've listened, should've left
I can't stop unless you jet
It's so simple, open head, I will knit my savage threat
Help me help you, walk away, leave this on amazing grace
You don't know from pure disgrace, you still think I'm here to save
I was never even really here, I can't give what I can't take

[Fades out:]
You still think I'm here to save
