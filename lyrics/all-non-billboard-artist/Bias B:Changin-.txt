Changin-:Bias B
[** feat. Muph:]


[Bias B:]
Change my focus, visions of a brighter future
When all seems hopeless, choose to make a new manoeuvre
Time to improve the person who I'm getting used ta
Used to be a drug abuser, be a user
Felt like a loser, but who's to say?
I moved away from the former self and into the new
I stay searching, but never know where happiness is lurking
Working towards my goal, but from the path I'm swerving
Mind changing like seasons
The mind chasing a reason to continue down this path
when half me wants to be leaving, and making change
Repeating the same things day after day the way I'm seeing
this world through the eyes of an exhausted kid
Aborting the negative thoughts and tryna get my shit sorted
And so I'm searching deep inside of my heart
Taking pride with the art of writing, trying to ignite a spark

[Muph:]
Changing my focus, time to make new goals
Strangely devoted to jumping through the loopholes
Majorly bloated because I grew my soul
Hater views take hold, no more cruise control
Blues unfold, then the wind gust picks me up
and I'm up for the positive transitions, I've got
beautiful visions though I'm missing the past
And there may be collisions where my path enters the dark
The centre of my heart needs to reveal
and feel that same part, cold as steel
I rolled with the wheels serrated, edge sharp
Hold the meal, it didn't appeal, pass the cask
I was stuck, drinking in the park
Searching for the leaf, relief and a brand new start
It's hard but it's far from impossible
Evolving, moulding myself to become unstoppable

[Bias B:]
Change my focus, stop and pull my socks up
Thinking this life that I've got sucks cause I haven't got much
I'm part of the mainframe but feel like an off cut
When life seems hard, search for the soft touch
There's not enough, just make and do, I've made it through
the first twenty-eight years, always facing new hurdles
Sometimes I feel I run around in circles
Get myself back on track, out of this mental whirlpool
Mind changing gears, I let my conscience steer
my every thought towards the future and ignore my fears
I try to stay focused as each day approaches
Cause everything's changing, that's the thing I've noticed
Through these eyes of frustration, the situation is
things that change this strain on my brain, I need replacement
And I'm looking deep inside of my mind
Taking time with the art of writing, trying to recite these lines

Gotta change myself
I've gotta change my life
Wanna change my thoughts
Wanna change my sights
I can't change the world
I can't change the past
But I can change my future
Just don't know where to start
Change myself
I've gotta change my life
Wanna change my thoughts
Wanna change my sights
I can't change the world
I can't change the past
But I can change my future
Just don't know where to start
