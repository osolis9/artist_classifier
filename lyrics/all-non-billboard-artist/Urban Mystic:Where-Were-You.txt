Where-Were-You:Urban Mystic
Yeah check this out
I am gonna ask you question
Where were you on that night
See I remember (Sugar)
I know where I was at
Hah lets reminisce about it

(Where were you)
When u first heard biggie or Pac
And you knew you were blest with the best of hip-hop
(where were you)
When u first drove a brand new Benz
Wood grain with all polished off rims
(where were you)
When your team came back with the ring
With your crew rolling through you could do anything
(where were you)
On the night that the love of your love got a room making love while the feeling inside
(where were you)

Close your eyes
And try to think back of the happiest days of your life
When you felt so alive
Just sit and reminisce there for awhile
For that time how it flies (flies)
Look up in the places and places have changed
And the things you once recognize d
Seem different in the twinkling of the eye

When u first heard biggie or Pac
And you knew you were blest with the best of hip-hop
(where were you)
When u first drove a brand new Benz
Wood grain off the wall with all polished off rims
(where were you)
When your team came back with the ring
With your crew rolling through you could do anything
(where were you)
On the night that the love of your love got a room making love while the feeling inside

Where were you
Tell me
Do you remember cuz I remember?
Where were you (you)

A fresh pair of Tims
Your very first charm on the chain
How you just couldn't just wait till the weekend began
Hook up with you friends and do it all again

Back when your first love was true
You had her back she had yours
Nobody dare disrespected cuz all of them knew
To feel that way again there isn't thing that you wouldn't do

When Jay put the needle to the record
Series 5 make it live with the message
And MJ had to be the jacket
Mine was plastic (plastic) (ghetto)

Where were you when Shaq left the Magic
Season later meet with Kobe at the Lakers
When you first got your 2-way pager
Tell me where were you

(where were you)
When u first heard biggie or Pac

When your team came back with the ring
With your crew rolling through you could do anything

On the night that the love of your love got a room (yeah)
