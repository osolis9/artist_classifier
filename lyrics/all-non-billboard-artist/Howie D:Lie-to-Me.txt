Lie-to-Me:Howie D
A moonlit wave, the color blue
Stole my strength Stole my Youth
All Around me, All Around me
Hey...
Water came and washed away
All my life in just one day

All around me, all around me
Hey... Hey...

Nobody told me we were too young
Nobody told me we couldn't love
Nobody warned me somebody's comin'
She is a flood
Nobody told me this wouldn't last
Her waves came and swept me back
Oh why, why,
Won't somebody lie to me?
Lie to Me

A seeking page floats below
The sad remains
of all we wrote

All around me, all around me
Hey... Hey, yeah

Nobody told me we were too young
Nobody told me we couldn't love
Nobody warned me somebody's comin'
She is a flood
Nobody told me this wouldn't last
Her waves came and swept me back
Oh why, why,
Won't somebody lie to me?
Won't somebody Lie to Me?

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I'm facin it alone
You're memory's like stone
Washing over me, Washing over me, Washing over me
I'll sink or I'll stay
It's with you or at bay
Could somebody please, just lie to me, yeah

Nobody told me we were too young
Nobody told me we couldn't love
Nobody warned me somebody's comin'
She is a flood
Nobody told me this wouldn't last
Her waves came and swept me back
Oh why, why,
Won't somebody lie to me?
Won't somebody lie to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Nobody told me this wouldn't last
Her waves came and swept me back
Oh why, why,
Won't somebody lie to me?
