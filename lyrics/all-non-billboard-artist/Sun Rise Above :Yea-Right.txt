Yea-Right:Sun Rise Above 
They'll defend your right to live til the day that you're born
But right after that, your right to life is gone
Ain't got a right to food or right to a job
Or right to a place to live 'cause the right is a fraud

Fuck the right 'cause they really don't like us
Strike us with terrorism, there's millions there in prison
Killing is their position, for profit 'cause nothing tops it
They'll steam roll ya lean on ya till they pop a socket
Then drop a toxic rocket on top of your block and knock it
Over, there's no talking it over, Glock in the holster
Jocking it closer than the heroes that you've got on your poster
You're supposed to vote a ballot invalid callously coax ya
The most you can expect is a job to collect a check
But the one's that getting richer are sticking you for the rest
Yes, this is how it goes for the workers they're out to jerk ya
Perpetrating, claiming saving when they're more like a satan
Hating women, trying to chain them to kitchens, pitching religion
Living in modern conditions yet dripping in superstition
True division with the rich and the poor, listen there's more
This edition is listed under the heading of sedition

They'll defend your right to live til the day that you're born
But right after that, your right to life is gone
Ain't got a right to food or right to a job
Or right to a place to live 'cause the right is a fraud
