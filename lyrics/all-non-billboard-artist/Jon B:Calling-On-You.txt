Calling-On-You:Jon B
Callin' on, calling' on you
I be callin' on, calling on you

Baby, I've been a crazy, crazy, crazy man
Leaving you all alone
Ain't talked for the past a week
And something I know you don't understand

Well lady, lately I've been stressin'
I think I need a remedy, I'm needing you close to me
And you're sounding like you really miss your man
Oh so here I am

Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I'll ease your mind
That's why I'm calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It's hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

I keep calling on you in the afternoon
You could be at work I'll sneak you out the back
Say you have an emergency, gotta tend to me
Baby you know that I don't know how to act

Sometimes you are a special thing
Always make my stresses go away
Even though I ain't called you baby
Think it's time to me that we communicate
Oh say, say baby baby

Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I'll ease your mind
That's why I'm calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It's hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I'll ease your mind
That's why I'm calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It's hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

Oh callin' on, callin' on baby
I wanna callin' on you baby
Sure I can call on you baby
