King-Black-Jesus:Black Jesus
So Imma say no for everything bad, inner peace,
nobody fucking with me, with my enemies,
less energy, from the black gang killer,
have a call on your phone, you fuck with hooligans,
foolish gang, douchebag, pink Manson with hummings words,
talking gibberish, i sing it like a bird,
and the birds fly, send a message then the birds die,
white crows, dark soul, black eyed,
you can thank me later, thank for nothing,
thank me for changing, thank for changing anything,
thank for changing anything into something,
unless that anything is everything,
so money is everything, you give cash i give ya change,
believe ya killer still throwin dollar, damn a lil strange,
hold up hold up, this man throwing verse on me to versus me?
learn from ya mistake boy, that make ya a man,

ak ak ak boy, dont give a fuck about your lil shit boy,
foreign car on our truck boy, fast 6 on top of hit boy,
you playing boy, no game boy, fuck game on lil troy,
Guess on our ass, Coach my head, LV party you tryna joy,
Fuck it, short leg MF tryna kick my ass while Im down,
Fuck you like I fuck Miki, karma get your ass till dawn,
Dreaming on stage with Joe, collab with SonaOne,
Stomp on Craprice, no one got yo back, that fun,
Come to you for money, no digger, typical everyone,
back to back in your song, bitches never got it done,
slay your rap, imma play your trap, bae,
i broke your back, bae, spinal cord, you got no nae nae,
