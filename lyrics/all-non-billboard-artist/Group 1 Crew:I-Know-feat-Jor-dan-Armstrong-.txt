I be on that, never gotta think about the on ramp
All I gotta do is put my cap back
And just bump that like it's on, man
I'm like Jordan, and it's all net
Errtime I get up on the mic, swish
I ain't even gotta try ta fight this
I'm like facebook 'cause you like this

And I might get crazy, lovin every minute he saved me
Never think about what I'd do without 'cause I never doubt
That he knew what he did, what he did when he made me
I'm street tested, God made
Knew I had a gift from the first grade
I got mad hate, tell me where you at... I don't see ya, partna

I know that you're with me (see me ridin')
I ain't worried 'bout nothin, ain't worried 'bout nothin
I know that you're with me (see me ridin')
I ain't worried 'bout nothin, ain't worried 'bout nothin

You can catch me on that Melrose, wasteland, thrift stow
Why pay mo when you can go, get a little come up, Macklemo
And I'm not ashamed to rock nice clothes, got nice shoes, them J Fours
And they watchin me a little too close
Like they hopin I would just die broke
And they really think that I'm too flashy
What, homie, that been me
Bought a crib for my mom, all cash, see what
Don't tellem that's rap, see
They say we brag a lot 'cause we cocky
Rolex, so they watch me
But I don't care what I got, see
Only care 'bout the one who got me

I know that you're with me (see me ridin')

They tellin me, homie, you need to slow down
But I ain't the type that will follow a crowd
I tellem I live in the fast lane
So, baby, catch up or you slowin me down
I ain't got time for the ones
Saying that I ain't the one
Who can be bigger than haters, who hatin my run
I only follow the one, son
I'm in these streets like I'll never give up
Hustle so hard, this the life that I love
No one can stop what's already been written
I'm fitten to answer the question, what's up, I am
Never gonna be the one that wonders what I'm here for
Been a long year, but it's only getting better
When I let the world know what the truth be
If you hang better hang loosely
Can't nobody move me, uh uh
Yeah, life like a movie, uh huh
I just follow the script my director has writte
'Cause he knows the ending so, baby, what's up

I know that you're with me (see me ridin')
I ain't worried 'bout nothin, ain't worried 'bout nothin
I know that you're with me (see me ridin')
I ain't worried 'bout nothin, ain't worried 'bout nothin
