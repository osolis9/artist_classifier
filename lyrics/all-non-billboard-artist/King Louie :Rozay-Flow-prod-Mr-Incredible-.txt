My old bitch was bad, my new bitch she badder
My mercedes fast, but it could be faster
Just got me a rocket, I don't work for NASA
My life is a movie, catch me on the plasma
Around with 2 pumps, and one for my asthma
They know I'm the king, these bitches calling me master
Just let it ring, when she call up don't answer
You should get your bez up, I ball like I got cancer

I got a bitch she a dancer, with a push panorama
I call my good rides Oprah 'cause their bitch full of fantoms
300 hundred for dinner man, got that 50k in them
Call machine guns toys, 'cause we be playing with 'em
See my lil nigga's mobbin' he and me said get 'em
East side land lord DC ride with 'em
Hit licks then split 'em throw benz and get him
Stupid racks they be on me and these niggas be phony
And these bitches be fucking and I don't give 'em nothing
Bust some dick and some gum and she might not come
Hella loud in my swisher I get more cheese than pitchers
Got a bitch in Miami and her donk is on 6's
Don't worry about for niggas shout out my nigga Vicious
My lil nigga's essentious blowing shots like they kisses

Hey man somebody just called a body
Big hit benjamines and my bitch a hottie
