My-Story:Sean McGee
Look me in my eyes in try to feel my pain
Do you know how it feels to be left out in the rain
Each and every day there's someone judging me
Worry about my life and how I live in these streets.
Every day I wake up
Got a hundred different haters
Trying to get this paper
Stacks look like elevators (elevators)
But no one really wants to hear my story
That's why I'm all alone 'cause no one
Here for me

Look me in my eyes in try to feel my pain
Do you know how it feels to be left out in the rain
Each and every day there's someone judging me
Worry 'bout my life and how I live in these streets

Look me in my eyes in try to feel my pain
Do you know how it feels to be left out in the rain
Each and every day there's someone judging me
Worry 'bout my life and how I live in these streets.I got no place to go
I'm living on a hope
And no one really know
What the hell is going on
How I feel inside
Feelings I try 2 hide
My daddy don't know
My momma don't care
It don't matter if I'm here
It don't matter if I'm dead
So what I'm suppose to do in this
Cold cruel world
Look me in my eyes in try to fell the pain
Do you know how it feels to be left out in the rain
Each and every day there's someone judging me
Worry 'bout my life and how I live in these streets

Look me in my eyes in try to fell the pain
Do you know how it feels to be left out in the rain
Each and every day there's someone judging me
Worry 'bout my life and how I live in these streets.Every day I wake up
Got a hundred different haters
Trying to get this paper
Stacks look like elevators (elevators)
But no one really wants to hear my story
That's why I'm all alone 'cause no one
Here for me

Woah woah oohhhh
