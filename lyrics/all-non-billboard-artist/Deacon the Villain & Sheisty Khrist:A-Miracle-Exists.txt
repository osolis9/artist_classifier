A-Miracle-Exists:Deacon the Villain & Sheisty Khrist
Corus

I hear music in the sky
I have never felt so high
could heaven be like this?

you making me forget about money
making me forget about pain
when I'm in your milk and honey
I forget about everything

so don't hold back
stay on track
when we let loose
when we react

girl I could be your adam
split atoms under the leaves
biting on your apple bottom
little mama you could be my eve

in paradise
with a pair of dice
let it roll
pay that price
halleluh
that's for lilfe
halleluh
that's for life

Through all of the rain
we touch the control
it's such a beautiful place and we need to go
ain't that the truth

Don't worry about the morning after
there's no disaster greater than letting moments pass ya
when in rapture
I'd hate for you to be thinking backwards
back when you had the opportunity to have some laughs

Repeat
