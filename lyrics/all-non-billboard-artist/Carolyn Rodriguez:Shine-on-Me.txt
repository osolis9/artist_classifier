Shine-on-Me:Carolyn Rodriguez
So Frustrated
Walls Close Ending On Me
Feels Like The World Is On Freeze
So Cold & Feeling Empty
All These Friends
That Turning Into Foes
And The Real Ones God Got Only Knows
When The Sun Will Finally Shine On Me
Shine On Me

I'm In These Fucken Walls
Music Gone - No Applause
So Where Is Everybody At?
That Said They Got Me Dog
I'm Sittin' On My Desk
Contemplated Bout It All
Does Anybody Even Think About Me Anymore?
Last Year Even My Best Friend
Fell Off The Team
He Said "Despensa G I Gotta Do My Own Thing"
And I Ain't Tryn' To Be Foul
But I Just Gotta Fool
Cause If Not I'm A Be Fucked
And Stuck Just Like You
Just Like Glue
Can't Move Or Tie My Own Shoe
Now What's That About Homie
That's What Gangstas Do
Now Ain't It True?
Real G's Need Love Too
I Watch The Love Fade Away Like A Oldie Tune
You Owe Me Fool
Don't Remember When I Wrote To You?
And Baby Girl's Getting Tired
She Be Lonely Too
Its About Time From The Heart
That I Spoke To You
You Probably Laugh It Off
Like I Told A Joke Or 2

So Frustrated
Walls Close Ending On Me
Feels Like The World Is On Freeze
So Cold & Feeling Empty
All These Friends
That Turning Into Foes
And The Real Ones God Got Only Knows
When The Sun Will Finally Shine On Me
Shine On Me

See Everything I Ever Loved Is Gone
A Kid Never Went To Prom
Tell Me Why I'm Suppose To Do Right?
When All I Knew Was Wrong
Before It Was Just Goodbye
Now It Turned To So Long
I'm Sittin' & Commence To Plottin'
Business In These Stone Walls
Another Sad Slow Song
You Could Say I Told Yall
So Where Am I Suppose To Go From Here?
Cause I Don't Really Know Dog
Parole The Family
They Must've All Been Mad At Me
Cause I Ain't Heard From 'Em In Years
And Baby Just Fell Off The Team
I Puff Some Hella Weed
Where Everything's A Felony
Seductive Evil Siders
Bien Celoso In These Jealous Streets
I Snap, Crackle, Pop
This 38 A Shell A Piece
Leave Ya In Drippin'
Full Of Blood
Until You Fell Asleep
I'm O.G
That Gutter Street & Dueces
Punching Up On Anybody
That's With That Bullshit
Be Stabbed Up Full Of Bruises
Write About In My Music
And I'm Ruthless
Cause My Boy D Salas Just Produced This

I Been Frustrated
Getting Faded Night & Day
Feels Like There's Nothing Left To Do
But Kneel & Pray
My Body's Here But My Mind So Far Away
Sometimes It's Like There's No Escape
