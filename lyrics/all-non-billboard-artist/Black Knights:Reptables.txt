Reptables:Black Knights
(feat. John Frusciante)

[Hook: Crisis]
The so called best we call them out
Black Knights go hard, don’t stall them out
Make cowards close they mouths until we gone
Talking like they had a can of man
Knock them down like a batteram
For thinking that they’re bad to the bone
Because losing ain’t an option
And failure is unacceptable
Treat hip hop just like the block boy
We Reptables

[Verse 1: Rugged Monk]
I don’t talk in Pig Latin
I don’t talk in tongues
I ain’t confessing to no priest
I ain’t talking to the ones
So you trying to play me close
Like you’re trying to find my weak spot
God, my community-YEAH-it run in progress
But we got our ups and downs
One pen, one page
What do, what do I write down
I will embarrassedly embarrass you
In front, in front of all them fans you thought that cherished you
My terrorist crew is the Black Knights
Crisis and Rugged Monk, rest in peace Doc Doom
To whom it may concern
Double crossed the Rugged you will get returned
Signed, sealed, delivered
Stamp on that
Trickfingers is in the building

[Hook: Crisis]
The so called best we call them out
Black Knights go hard, don’t stall them out
Make cowards close they mouths until we gone
Talking like they had a can of man
Knock them down like a batteram
For thinking that they’re bad to the bone
Because losing ain’t an option and failure is unacceptable
Treat hip hop just like the block boy
We Reptables

[Verse 2: John Frusciante]
At wits end, you stared into my eyes with all my problems gone
I wanna say that all I negate is fine
The sound rebounds and resets tissue
Auf Wiedersehen
You step into my life and what the people say
In their confusion
Always full of pride
Resung my song is gone now people

[Verse 3: Crisis]
MCs I'm known to chastise, memorize, crucify
Black Knights known for tripping like running with your shoes untied
They can't deny what we provide
Turn ciphers to Vietnam
Niggas better keep it calm
Bitches say that we the bomb
The west say that we the ones
To take them to that next shit
Our presence leave them breathless
Once they witness perfection
Get muted by the undisputed
Hog tied then executed
Sharpshooter next to do it
Flow fluent, bless the music
Niggas best respect the movement
Pay Hamish don't make me lose it
You behind us don't confuse it
Keep it honest niggas losers
And we winners causing trimmers
Bring forth a new beginning
Keep it real while you pretending
Leave your team out of commission
For wishing you was what you not
Fronting like you calling shots
Soon as my words come out
They transform like auto bots
They don't want to shadow box
Pressure like a ton dropped
Move crowds like gun shots
Murk you off then bottle pop

[Hook: Crisis]
The so called best we call them out
Black Knights go hard, don’t stall them out
Make cowards close they mouths until we gone
Talking like they had a can of man
Knock them down like a batteram
For thinking that they’re bad to the bone
Because losing ain’t an option and failure is unacceptable
Treat hip hop just like the block boy
We Reptables

[Outro: Rugged Monk]
Black Knights, Black Knights
Rugged rugged rugged
What what what what
So why you trying to play me close
Crisis and Rugged Monk
