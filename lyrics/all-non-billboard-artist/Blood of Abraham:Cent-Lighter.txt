Cent-Lighter:Blood of Abraham
You're shallow like a puddle, the deep ones need to huddle
You bitch-ass individuals can call your girls and cuddle
The times are gettin' serious, critical and furious
Heads are flyin' everywhere but I remain oblivious

Through it all, I got a wall in front of me, above me, below me
You're actin' like you know me but you don't and you never will
Experience the thrill of what it's like to be alive
Not real you are contrived

I'm tryin' to tell you, somethin' but all you know is nothin'
Breakin' down MC's just like a sport similar to huntin'
First I see you grazin', I lock on with my eye
Your life expectancy becomes identical with a fly

Your destiny is sealed, sonny, it was written long ago
MC gets shot on stage while his mother watch the show
My beats are brewed fresh daily from the comforts of my home
Just like the mornin' paper I'm on time like metronomes

Season of the spider, everyone's a fighter
I could burn your house with a 99 cent lighter
Lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter
I am a simple soul

My style ain't obvious, mysterious and low
Wets leave you wet due to miscellaneous flows
I'm now transcendental, over instrumentals
It's not accidental when I'm freakin' wit'cha mental

The rap phenomenon and gravitational breaker
Gobble circuits and cities, my whole committee will take
Apart your whole foundation 3 degrees of separation
Head body and limbs all placed in separate nations

Ain't nothin' common about this 'cause it ain't thinkable
Ain't no prints visible when I display lyrical
'Cause it's all in the way I serenade
I feast on booty niggaz who flayed

'Cause the back of all layin' individuals not up to par
My technique will sweep in and rock the Casbah
It's like that sonny, I rock like stone
Your oral synthetic and fake like silicon

Season of the spider, everyone's a fighter
I could burn your house with a 99 cent lighter
Lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter
I am a simple soul

Yo, I hear someone's comin', he's bringin' you a clue
The dopest things in life are guaranteed to be taboo
The trees are talkin' to me now and tellin' me to turn the page
Forget about the old and what could end the brand new age

'Cause the rules do not apply and not too much is fair
You either got the cash or you're entangled in the snare
Called the world, wide web in the season of the spider
Complex and combustible just like a dirt cheap lighter

From Mariana Trench up to the tops of Everest
The Blood is international, headquarters in the West
Before you come to capture me I book like Deuteronomy
I wake up in the mornin' way before the reveille

And then I grab the microphone, sing a song of sorrow
Got some dope-ass books if you want to you could borrow
You better bring 'em back, my property don't disrespect
You conversate with me you conversate with the adept

Season of the spider, everyone's a fighter
I could burn your house with a 99 cent lighter
Lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter
I am a simple soul, I, I, I am a simple soul
And as a soldier I take things simply

Season of the spider, everyone's a fighter
I could burn your house with a 99 cent lighter
Lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter
I am a simple soul
