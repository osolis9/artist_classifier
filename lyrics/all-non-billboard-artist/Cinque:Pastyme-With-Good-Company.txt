Pastyme-With-Good-Company:Cinque
Pastime with good company
I love and shall, until I die.
Grudge who lust, but none deny,
So God be pleased, thus live will I.
For my pastance, hunt, sing and dance,
My heart is set;
On goodly sport, for my comfort,
Who shall me let?

Youth must have some dalliance,
Of good or ill√© some pastance,
Company, methinks the best,
All thoughts and fancy to digest.
For idleness, is chief mistress,
Of vices all.
Then who can say, but mirth and play,

Is best of all?

Company with honesty,
Is virtue vices to flee;
Company is good and ill,
But every man hath his free will.
The best ensue, the worst eschew,
My mind shall be;
Virtue to use, vice to refuse,
Shall I use me.
