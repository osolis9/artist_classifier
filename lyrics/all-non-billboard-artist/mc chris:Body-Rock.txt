Body-Rock:mc chris
It's a hit

mc chris is in the house (Say what, say what)
mc chris is in the house (Say what)
mc chris is in the house (Say what)
mc chris is in the house (One two three)
I Say come on everybody grab a body like it's putty
Name is mc chris and yo I ain't no fuddy duddy
When it comes to funk I'm just a fuckin' sperm
Like Redd Foxx I duck like mc to herb
I can get down like and elevator with it's cable cut
I'll fuck you up like Dynomutt word up
I like Huckleberry Hound I get my ass outta town
Like Clint outta dodge when the shit goes down
Like mc to Chaucer when the prices go up
Like the gutter I go there when I'm about to throw up
Hold up cut it stop wait a minute
Did someone hear my rap none of yo bidness
It's about the body rock the sure shot the hip hop
The party in the basement with the pimple nosed disc jock
The dips the chips the chains the whips
Name is mc chris the body rock bullshit

It's time to rock your body
There's a party in the house
x3

Party's in the house cause I'm too loud for outside
Make your bouce while your doing nitrouis oxide
Make out with your lady 'neath the moon on a hayride
I say party's in the house and it's jam packed tight
Make your body bounce while you sip bud light
Make out with your lady if she says alright 'aight

Distribution of the mc revolution
The latest evolution of the fusion
Refusin' malt liquor and scratch'n'sniff stickers
We're all finger lickers and we're satisfied like Snickers
Name is mc chris and I've been known to pop rocks
I could get high even while I'm in detox
Your Reebok's are dated your birthdays belated
Your Guess jeans are faded and your ass is constipated
Elevatin's what you are when you hear my groove
Syncopated to the beat on your feet while you move
Don't lose just win I won't accept a draw
Name is mc chris I'll eat you up like Jabberjaw

It's time to rock your body
There's a party in the house
x3

Party's in the house cause we're too loud for the outside
Make your bounce while your doing nitrouis oxide
Make out with your lady 'neath the moon on the hayride
Party's in the house cause it's been packed tight
Make your body bounce while you sip bud light
Make out with your lady if she says alright 'aight

Without a flaw I go down south like Hee-Haw
Got your head bobbin' like and old seesaw
Don't worry about a cover cause your on the list
Name is mc chris the body rock bullshit
So do the march like General Sherman
Do the strut like Uma Thurman
Do the Jerk like Pee Wee Herman
alright
