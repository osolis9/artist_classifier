Avians:Cyne
Olly Olly Oxen Free I be me
Move to the top of the world and yell please
Live in a dream let a caged bird sing
You
Can't
Stop
Me
Polaroid of fire
I am a tiger
Mixed with lion so please call me lyger
Bigger stronger
Yes Cyndi Lauper
Hair so big so yes sir I'm awesome
Blossom was nice but Six was the sexy
Topanga I need ya
Winnie Cooper bless me
Now we all grown up so now what
When you see a brother don't act stuck up!
Crazy amazing, still life's a painting
Nucleus, proton, a Voltron baby
Save me
Somebody call a Robocop
Gun in the Stanky leg did the Moonwalk
Who's the Boss, Tony Danza or Rick Ross
Fresh to death too cool for hot sauce
Who's the Boss Tony Danza or Rick Ross
Fresh to death too cool for hot sauce

Gandhi saw me, said "fuck ya army"
Sound the alarm the bullets will crash parties

So cool
So new
Take you back to the new school

Like Marty McFly had the fly Nike boots
I needs to go Back to the Future 2
Skip to my Lou so what we got to lose
Gotta make it back to the dark side of the moon

Lights flashing
What's happening
Rerun sung the anthem while laughing
Alas no class I crash on the casting
Couch
Jumped up when I heard a shout
It wasâ€¦

Took the glove from Dr. Strangelove
Now I make fist every time that I run
200 meters
Saturday Night Fever
400 degrees go fetch the preacher
Or Juvenile you don't know he on fire?
17 inch Momo's, Black Magic on the tires
Tell him the news I got a case of the blues--
Blue Moon that is. orange slices too
Murungu
Don't be scared we won't eat you
Dance in the sun with a Zambezi brew
Damned if you do
But
Damned if you don't
Just
Dance to the note to the Cape of Good Hope
Ivory Coast just raised up the ghost
Now we float on a boat is this a bad joke?
Got me locked down like kilos of coke
Looked down on the chains to see one is broke sooo.
