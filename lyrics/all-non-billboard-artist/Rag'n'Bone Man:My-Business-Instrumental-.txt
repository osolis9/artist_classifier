My-Business-Instrumental-:Rag'n'Bone Man
My business is my business
My crime is my own,
And this stage is mine
You do not know me so,
These ain't your hands to hold,
This ain't your spliff to smoke,
Don't talk about it now,
This is my microphone

(1)
Fuse ain't as long as it used to be
Words caught deeper than they ever did
Talkin stupid ain't my thing,
Without the drugs or the gin
Nice fellow, kinda mellow
Not without sin,
Why you talkin so loud in my head?
Is it something you wanted to hear?
I don't owe you conversation,
Maybe a smile
