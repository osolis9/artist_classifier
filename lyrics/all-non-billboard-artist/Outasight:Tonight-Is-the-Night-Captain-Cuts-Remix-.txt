Tonight-Is-the-Night-Captain-Cuts-Remix-:Outasight
I've been feeling real good
Came a long way from misunderstood
Far away from the days where I wouldn't wanna go home
'Cause I was afraid of the truth

See I was scared to admit
That failing was in the back of my head
Comes a point when lying no longer works
So you have to stand up for how you want to live

Tonight is the night is the night
That we're losing control
Tonight is the night is the night
We set it off

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

And I don't know better
But as far as I came it felt like forever
Seconds turn to hours, days turn to months
Another year pass by but don't feel like much

So if I got one chance
Motherfucker, imma make y'all dance
Imma have as much fun as I can
And figure out the rest when I etch out a plan

Tonight is the night is the night
That we're losing control
Tonight is the night is the night
We set it off

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm feelin' better than I ever thought,
It's possible but now I know.
I'm feelin' better than I ever did,
Impossible don't exist.

Impossible don't exist...

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everybody go
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Wooh wooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Tonight is the night is the night that we're losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off
Tonight is the night is the night that we're losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off
