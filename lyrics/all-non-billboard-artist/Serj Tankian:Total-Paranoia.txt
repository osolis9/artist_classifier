Total-Paranoia:Serj Tankian
Stop by your nightmare
On a dark road today
Such a wind through his white hair
Such a grin on in his face
His eyes where like distance and he bore into mine
They shown and they glisten like they drive me blind
Then he stood there before me and he cried out in pain
You think you can ignore me, you think you'll get away
Ready or not, it's like total paranoia
Anything you say he can't twist his way
It's really too much, it's like total paranoia
Anyway you go he is sure to know
He said, "Stop please and listen, can we try to be friends?"
Why is it always so twisted but he cried out again
You can stand to remember, you can stand to forget
You won't lift the finger for the storm of regret
Ready or not, it's like total paranoia
You know how to pray but he won't go away
It's really too much, it's like total paranoia
Close your eyes he'll be there all night
Close your eyes he'll be there all night
He'll be there all night
He'll be there all night
He'll be there all night
