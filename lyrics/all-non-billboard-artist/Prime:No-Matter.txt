No-Matter:Prime
I'm trapped in the mind state gettin' fly like magic rugs
Doin' and sellin' drugs and praisin' the thugs
I was programmed this way, so it ain't my fault
Too late to turn back, I might change an assault

A whole lot to get into, with little to do
Hit girls right the first time, so it's deja vu
Paid the price my whole life, my attitude's a receipt
Easily learnin' life's ill's that are so hard to teach

When I was crazy young, I had tons of fun
Nowadays life's a bitch or a son of one
Maybe to get this money, I just really don't have the knack
Maybe I'm on borrowed time that I can't pay back

Or maybe I'm caught up in some Elm Street dream
And to get the hell out I must wake up by any means
But how can a war be won, if no one had a fort
Drinkin' flammable solution, returnin' to this thought

No matter how loud I pray, God don't hear a sound
That's why I put my joint to the sky, let off a round
'Cause can't no other man feel this black man's
But another with no dough, goin' insane

No matter how loud I pray, God don't hear a sound
That's why I put my joint to the sky, let off a round
'Cause can't no other man feel this black man's
But another with no dough, goin' insane

Every man has two lives, so there's two stories
But both of mine are in between right and wrong like purgatory
I express a lot of heart when I write
About these stressful days and these nights cold like ice

It's just like bad dice, you press your luck and you roll
With efforts to make cash and now you in a deeper hole
Oh no, you wake up
Cops all around and now you in some hand cuffs

You need some bail money but your fam wanna front
You think to yourself where your plan slipped up
That's when your girl says she missed the time of the month
That's when you feel funny and strange in your gut

It's just that shit that makes a nigga grab the clip
And just all out flip, my rap flows real
Fuck flavor, I kick real life in your ear
I'm god sent, drinkin' strong Brandy, just stayin' bent

No matter how loud I pray, God don't hear a sound
That's why I put my joint to the sky, let off a round
'Cause can't no other man feel this black man's
But another with no dough, goin' insane

Sometimes I want it all, but I know it can't happen
So I buy pens to support this rap habit
You silly rabbit, see tricks are for kids
I'm not tryin' to do bids and get fish like squids

I'm on some power moves, against the powers that be
I'm in another realm, against the powers that be
Can you dig it? If you do grab that shit
Twist that shit and swig it

And taste the truth and feel the proof
That's comin' live through your speaker
My thoughts are deeper
On the last page like a beeper

Life is like an erection and some ass
It feels real good, but it don't last
So take a bowl and pass 'cause gettin' by ain't a game
In these last Babylonian days

Drinkin' flammable solution with a painful thought
Drinkin' flammable solution with this thought

No matter how loud I pray, God don't hear a sound
That's why I put my joint to the sky, let off a round
'Cause can't no other man feel this black man's
But another with no dough, goin' insane
