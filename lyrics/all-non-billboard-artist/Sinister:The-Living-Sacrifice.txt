The-Living-Sacrifice:Sinister
Redemption, a faceless child though still insane
Displacement, dripping blood will still remain

Existence, trial of the upper hell
Obedience exhuming bodies from the earth

An eye for an eye makes the world blind
The self indulgent, now tangled in gore
Seeking replacement of all that is gone
The violent and the malicious, the battle is won

The world of heaven and hell
Both real and symbolic
You have incited me

Language of strange formation
Speaking in ancient tongue
The self indulgent, now lying in wait
Publish what is forbidden?
Awake or fantasy?
The violent and the malicious, the battle is won

The world of heaven and hell
Both real and symbolic
You have incited me

Feasting on blood what is left of it?
Killing will this be ever done?

The world of heaven and hell
Both real and symbolic
You have incited me

Ascend out of the outer gloom
Strictly directing the birth of regret
As time will fall and others will perish
Generations of conflicts
The truth will set you free

The world of heaven and hell
Both real and symbolic
You have incited me
