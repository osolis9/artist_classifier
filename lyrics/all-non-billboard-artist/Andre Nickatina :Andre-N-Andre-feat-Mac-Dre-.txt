Andre-N-Andre-feat-Mac-Dre-:Andre Nickatina 
Mac Dre--
Backwoods got me congested, ain't rested in 2 days
I'm gettin paid been on niggas head like toupes
I'm a thug 'cause wipe the blood out yo gaze
Cutthoat nigga bitch I scam on 'em fo days
In school days I blew baze got ripped and f**ked up
In new jays on 2 ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that bitch up when I found out she lyin
Who she think I am? Saving Private Ryan?

Andre Nickatina--
I make the town move just by walkin on your block
Take the keys to yo city but I still picked the locks
Buy a car and a glock put the cash in my socks
put the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law the freeways mines
so is yo freak, radios, and alpines
Coke wit a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money everytime
Kennel Cole shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but pisces is the sign

Mac Dre--

I got split personalities I'm bipolar
Ya might see me wit my Italion stallion or my chola
Rap rock n rolla I'm dope as yola
If you dont pimp her, I might like?
I'm ridin in a big boat like Noah
Wit 2 women of each races boy I control her
A ho a ho stable I'm a Mac and a medic
No do ho debt it, thats right I said it

Andre Nickatina--

I treat my dolla bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chill pill freak do what ya will
Heart ticking like a timebomb eatin spicy prawns
Man its the God of Khan check it baby right or wrong
man look but dont stare its the crime rhyme king
wit braids like a juvenile ca na mean?
bruce springsteen in my anchor blue jeans
o yea im in yo city man whats up wit the weed?
man call all the g's and tell em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin nigga what ya need?
hit the corner so narrow in a fly blue camaro
a sparrow dodging arrow but not a double barrel

Mac Dre--

We in a 7 series beema its me and nickatina
ready to sexually harass a bitch like Martin did Geena

a dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
rap singer pimp thatll slap Tina
I mack Nina from black to latina
clean as noxzema quick to pop the nina
got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Will I meet a Tina and Trina? got dick by the bay on the berkeley marina
dont mean to the point the finger but uh (but uh)
she got pancake syrup but uh (but uh)

Andre Nickatina--

man the way i smoke weed is like death of a genius
reappear roll up rise like a phoenix
this is not a remix nino felix
put it in a capsule seal it deal it
how you want it nicky baby? 4 times 5
a quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pot pies
excuse me if Im greedy 'cause I'm caught up in the lust
Ill lie if ya want but Im a tiga you can trust
'cause Im on Fillmoe in a white velour suit
in a blue kangol in my wu-tang boots
wit a back like a cobra cursed by the mail
my manicured nails touch a triple beam scale
baby is a athlete body like a star
ya talkin real bad freak meet me by the car
