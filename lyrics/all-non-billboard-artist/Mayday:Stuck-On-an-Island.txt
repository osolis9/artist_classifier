Stuck-On-an-Island:Mayday
Stuck on an island
(And I'm)
Stuck on an island
(And there's)
No way to find me
(No)
No one to try me
(Though)
And if I die alone
Then you can tell 'em that I never S.O.S.ed
And I ain't never had a fear

Stuck on an island
(And I'm)
Stuck on an island
(And I'm)
Feeling so violent
(From)
Trying survive in 'em
I never tried to run
And you can tell 'em that I never S.O.S.ed
Cause I be staying right here
Staying right here
Staying right

Who would of known
This place would be my home?
No where to fucking go
No way to save my soul
I crash landed all over the band stand
And now all these leaders
Got these spears
Pointed at my cannons
Looking for they gold
Some how they seem to know
But that ain't stopping me
Got more to lose if I just go
Had to put on a show
Make it storm, shock and awe
Make 'em believe Messiah
Til they had no other precious stones
Watch them crowd around a cause
When in fact they bein led down the volcanoes jaws
These mutualistic types can tend to get so involved
That they easily deceive 'em then confuse things with God
Oh Lord
Soon this island will be mine
From every shore-line to every mountain-side
Let them run, let them hide
Let them travel in disguise

Cause when its finally the time
They wish they never defied
For now I'm

Stuck on an island
(And I'm)
Stuck on an island
(And there's)
No way to find me
(No)
No one to try me
(Though)
And if I die alone
Then you can tell 'em that I never S.O.S.ed
And I ain't never had a fear

I'm walking down the shore, bonfire in the sand
Besides this little rock I can see no other land
I've been talking with the shade who's a slave to the sun
Trapped in his cage by the time the days begun
I've been climbing up trees, green leaves yes please
Give me earth, give me dirt, moon-shine, give me weed
This little island's all I need
To resurrect a head, bang-boogie, make 'em bleed
I've been Lord of the Flies
Since the shore minimized
And the water would rise
From us, warming the tide
It's been doomsday and I've been Dr. Murad
Twenty-twelve and the first stops hell, here we go
I used to love the city life, carnivore core
Kicking carbon monoxide, kids car doors
But this ain't no sock hop
And so when the bombs drop
Call me John Locke
I kick it non-stop

Stuck on an island
(And I'm)
Stuck on an island
(And there's)
No way to find me
(No)
No one to try me
(Though)
And if I die alone
Then you can tell 'em that I never S.O.S.ed
And I ain't never had a fear
