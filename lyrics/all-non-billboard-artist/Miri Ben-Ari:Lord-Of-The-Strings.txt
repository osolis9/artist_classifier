Lord-Of-The-Strings:Miri Ben-Ari
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I, J, I wanna write somethin' immaculate
'Cause that's what you are
I would say you're bright, like the little lights in the night
But you're so far, beyond the stars
Me lady you're bad like the water found on Mars

You see when she places the violin
Under her chin and begins
A melody breezes through the atmosphere
Like angel's wind

Her harmony feels right like when angels bend
When she strikes a chord, my Lord
She impacts the earth
Like Mr. Bojangles tappin' in Timbs

With her, no, my flow can't be down, I scribe of fountains
'Cause she makes me feel like I can climb mountains
Like Proto in Sound
Isn't it obvious this ma'am isn't merely a queen
This clearly, this gift is Miri, Lord of the Strings

Play a little song for 'em
To the whole world, Chi-Town
