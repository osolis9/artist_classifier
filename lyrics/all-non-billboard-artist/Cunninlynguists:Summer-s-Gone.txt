Summer-s-Gone:Cunninlynguists
(Natti)
Its bout that time when niggas start sweatin like slavery
Harsh heat make looking down the street all wavery
Ladies that bundle up in winter unwrap and wave at me
Wanna have it made in the shade beneath the canuhpee
Canopy, can it be beautiful? the season
Summer under investigation give niggas reasons
To shorten up they fuse, look violent on the news
More families to sit sobbin silently on the pews
Over stepped on shoes or some other shit that's petty
Guns and sun equals a relationship that's deadly
Hear it in this medley, feel it in this song
Feelings the burn somehow we unlearn our sense of wrong
My concern is why does summer gotta be gone
For straps to stay in the home of us that ought to be grown
No more altercations where bullets gotta be thrown
But that dream is ice cream, meltin off of the cone
Feel me
