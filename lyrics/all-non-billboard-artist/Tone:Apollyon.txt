Apollyon:Tone
Apollyon come up from thy soil. 
Drain my veins and will them with pestillence. 
Mark this soul with the purest evil. 
Distinguish signs of greed mark my body. 
No god can save me. 
Content with darkness, my true good side. 
All my dreams have turned to fucking dust. 
Consume my life. Take me away. Burn my soul.
