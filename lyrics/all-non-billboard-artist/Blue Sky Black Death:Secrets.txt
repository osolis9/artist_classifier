Secrets:Blue Sky Black Death
Show me, oh, how i should
Show me how far you'd go
Keep all our secrets safe and i would do anything
If you, oh, want me to
I will do if you say so
Tell me, oh, what you need 
And I won't say no, oh no

Undone, a shot unheard 
To the depths of my golden sun
If you were to lie to me
Oh, to the death i'd see

Wallow in a trail of absence
Oh, how I long for you
I long for you

Quiet now, oh, we must not tell 
A single soul about this tale
To the grave no one will know
This is ours not to tell, oh oh

Oh no, oh no, oh no...

Show me, oh, how I should
Show me how far you'd go
Keep all our secrets safe and I would do anything
If you, oh, want me to
I will do if you say so
Tell me, oh, what you need 
And I won't say no, oh no

Undone, a shot unheard 
To the depths of my golden sun
If you were to lie to me
Oh, to the death I'd see

Wallow in a trail of absence
Oh, how I long for you
I long for you

Quiet now, oh, we must not tell 
A single soul about this tale
To the grave no one will know
This is ours not to tell, oh oh
