In-Ya-Face:Ebony Eyez
Now this the part where we break it down(uhuh)
Gon' break it down(uhuh uhuh)
Gon' break it down(x3)
Jus break it down
Now pick it up(uhuh)(jus break it down)
Now pick it up(uhuh uhuh)(gon' break it down)
Now pick it up
Jus pick it up
Now pick it up
Gon' pick it up

Im fresh off da block
Fresh off da press yes
Stay fresh wit da dress
Fresh sittin' in da lex-us
Fellas wanna date us
And da heffas wanna fight us
Thats da word that got around
Then my joints as tight as arthritus
And i gotta hit da club
Gotta get some love
Mix it wit alot otha stuff
Now i'm seein' double vision
baby daddys trippin wit there baby mamas starting drama
but there aint no room to fight tonight
its hotter than the suanna

gotta be da track boys
if its makin' that noise
gettin' paper to my pockets bigger than da phat boys
gon' and look around
while i gon' and put it down
while u scopin' around
im on da floor gettin' down

and i gotta give you bits and pieces
anything else is indecent
da club is packed wit heathens
who dont get madder they get even
its gettin' hot in hurrr
tell me how you got in hurrr
see so many fine niggas glad my man not in hurrr

(Chorus) x2
now would you let me put my ass in ya face (in ya face)
(would you let me put my ass in ya face)
if i let you bend me over by the waist (by the waist)
(if i let you bend me over by the waist)

Now im back once again
back in da benz
back wit some friends
stack in them ends
gettin' it crackin' again
i don't need no riddas
middle finga to da bitas
and i shit on more rappers than babies in diapers and cyphas
And you can bet that in set
jet in a vet
oh and dont let me forget
da best you don' met yet
and i aint lyin'
cats be dyin'
tryin' ta get inside my tight jeans
they jus aint sayin' da right thing
no matta how it might seem
(oh)they like da way them ghetto girlz can get there coochie poppin'
might take you out
and wine and dine u even take you shoppin'
now he gon' keep on spendin'
long as you can keep from grinnin'
guraunteed that you be winnin'
this is only the beginin'

world gotta know
dat this girl gotta flow
and im servin' em' yo
Nothin' like theyve heard befo'
thats why i give it to em' cuz i know they want it
and they need it
dont mean to sound concieted
but if you dont eat it leave

(Chorus x2)
now would you let me put my ass in ya face (in ya face)
(would you let me put my ass in ya face)
if i let you bend me over by the waist (by the waist)
(if i let you bend me over by the waist)

Now this the part where we break it down
gon' break it down
gon' break it down
jus break it down
gon' break it down(x3)
jus break it down

Now pick it up
gon' pick it up
now pick it up
jus pick it up
now pick it up
jus pick it up
now pick it up
gon' pick it up

(Chorus x2)
now would you let me put my ass in ya face (in ya face)
(would you let me put my ass in ya face)
if i let you bend me over by the waist (by the waist)
(if i let you bend me over by the waist)
