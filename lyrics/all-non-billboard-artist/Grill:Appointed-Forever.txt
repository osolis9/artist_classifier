Appointed-Forever:Grill
I wrote a song a long time ago about you
She works in the back and she works in the store
and she don't go got that old stuff anymore
She likes to get high and listen to bands
She likes to make love to her kinda man
outlaw women first if their kind
outlaw women got here right on on time
outlaw women don't need any gun
outlaw women their just out for fun
in a way she a lot like me
She don't give a dam about society
might be a little rich girl or she might be poor
She might be a married woman he needs a little more outlaw women first of their kind
outlaw women been riding high since 79
outlaw women don't need any gun
outlaw women were just out for fun
Some call her lady some call her other names
But you won't call her that around me or my gang
