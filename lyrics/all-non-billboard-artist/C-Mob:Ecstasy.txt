Ecstasy:C-Mob
I know I can come across as an asshole but I want you to know that
I wanna try to get to know you, and show you, that my heart's not cold, black
I'm feelin you, you're feelin me, and I know they say that it's best to make em wait
But I wanna experience every part of ya body so now I'm kissin on ya breasts so take the bait
I can deliver the sex to make ya quake, give a fuck about the rest cuz they can hate
If they really wanna take the hate into another level I can make em meet the expiration date
They can learn to get the hell on, a grown man I'm well grown
Let me lay ya on ya stomach I'mma kiss ya from the back and ya neck to ya tailbone
My lips on ya lower lips below ya hips they slowly drip
Hold me quick I'll slowly slip inside ya slit and boldly grip
Inside my fists I'm tuggin hair, girl now that's good lovin there
Her body's rubbin bare get rough and we're huffin and puffin air
You're unaware this love affair could fulfill all ya fantasies
Time to fuck ya mentally make love to my insanity
Cuz ya gotta learn to ease the pain on my mind if ya wanna be my girl
Conversate for a little bit after we're done and introduce ya to my world

I'm on top of you, and you're on top of me
Girl you fuck me properly
Nothing can compare to how you're sexin me
This the definition of ecstasy

I wanna hear you, moan, as you diggin nails into my shoulder blades
We're all alone, makin love to music from the older days
Temptations and Isley Brothers, blind folds to surprise each other
Sex until the morning never boring we're some lively lovers
Can't track time cuz we forget, you're so moist the sheets are wet
If you get tired no need to fret, cuz on my face feel free to sit
I'm lovin the way that ya makin me feel it's the perfect way that you are easin my stress
Takin ya tongue and ya flickin it right on the tip and it tingles ya teasin my flesh
Pleasin the best, at night ya my queen, I'm about to give you ya crown then
Rip all over yo round, end, I'm lovin ya beautiful brown, skin
Please you with my tentra tactics and the bedroom bandit practice
Knock the matress off it's axis girl no other man can match this
Baby you gotta fire frame, take you to a higher plane
Love pure ecstacy and make you scream out my entire name
And when I'm done you'll tell me how I hit it properly
From the back, from the front, from the side, and plus when you're on top of me
