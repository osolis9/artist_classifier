Michael, the lover
Before him, there was no other
In his time, there may be many
When he's gone, there won't be any
I'm talking 'bout Michael, the lover
Michael, the lover
Girls are tender, sad and sweet
But no other boys can compete
'Cause Michael's got a style of his own
And the girls say his rap is strong
That's Michael, the lover
Michael, the lover
Everybody knows him
For his rap is strong
With lots of fame
When the girls see him coming
They tighten up their game
Cause Michael's 'bout
The loveliest boy
And he's got to bring you
Your pride and joy
That's Michael, the lover
Before him, there was no other
In his time, there may be many
When he's gone, there won't be any
Talking 'bout, talking 'bout
Talking 'bout, talking 'bout
Michael, the lover
Michael, the lover
He's a lover
Everybody knows that's Michael
Everybody calls him Michael, the lover
Michael, everybody knows him
I know you know him
The girls all know him
Michael, the lover...
