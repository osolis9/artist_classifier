Music Of The Mind
When it gets too ba-ad,
and I never know which way to turn,
there's a friend I see-ee, oh yeah,
who believes in me.

He is all I have,
oh put your hand away
and bring it out
another day.

If I listen hard, if I listen hard now,
I can hear him sayyy
I know somewhere we can go,
so much better.

Oh the music in my mind,
oh now the music in my mi-i-ind,
I know somewhere we can go,
so-o much better.

Oh the music in my mind!
The music in my mi-i-i-ind yeah.

I can take you there
I can take you there
Oh now
I wanna say that I can take you there
