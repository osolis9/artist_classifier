Airplane:Crucial Conflict
(hook: repeat 2X)
Keep on taking me high, so high
If they say we fly, we fly
(Who dat?) Flict' and Do or Die
(Who dat?) Coming from the Chi

Bring in the bidness, shut em' down cause their raw
Making you feel this, two of the realest crews
Laying the rules, do you wanna get chewed up?
Shut em' down, one round, when we cruise up
Don't pop, one two, combination get a swift violation
Put it on my nation, hit em' high, low, murderistic flow
We can throw down, in the middle we clown

To all my homies locked down, you know I got the clip
I'm a pop 'em and drop 'em with two shot
Just sippin' and dippin', are you slippin' and trippin'?
Motherfucker we don't care who dropped on who block
You gotta ride on, you'd better say what motherfucking side you on
Never know what the Flict' and Do or Die be on
85 MPH

Finna' break all them fakes, in your face, demonstrate
Suckers never knew we ever get together on you tricks
Chop it like dope, take another year, better step back coming like lunatics

A.K the dope with the scope
And any motherfucker run up will get smoked
And any motherfuckers run up will get choked
Coming from the hood and we ain't no joke

(hook)

True representation coming from the Chi, plenty much to deal with
Tell me could you feel this realness, feel the illness
(?) the world on the business, we live for thrillness
We still could steal this, let 'em really get to know the deal in this game
When you push up the price on your name, cause people cause the rain
Trying to get your message, just live off your vein
Keep blowing, flowing, glowing, now your soaring like a airplane
Flying through the sky
Steady keep on pimpin' and we thinking were Do or Die
Keep em' hot and horny and the canist they want a ride
If they say we high, we high

They say your bogus, you got the locusts
Can't hardly keep my focus, mentally I be the dopest nigga
Nigga been sippin' cypher with my six shot rifle
Tonights the night I take flight, I keep it hot like vipers so fly

I'm knowing your thinking were too zoned out, too blowed in the Mo' gone
But your all wrong, all we do is fly
We show floating on, still strollin' on, keep it strokin' on
>From the home of the C-H-I-C-A-G-O
Do or Die and Crucial on the airplane
Represent for the same thang, running that we claim, the bounce bang
Ring slang to the picture, should I wreck shop?
Airplane on the get up, what
You can't stop what you can't get up to touch
You wanna be down, be down where we stay up
Droppin' bombs bout' to blow up
Sure 'nuff it's a hold up on the airways
You're dazed, in the phase, gonna craze, got you crazed
Fly swayed cache, air tight take a flight off hay
On a comeup like airplanes

(hook)

Westside hoodlum with spit shine toys, rhinestone playboy from Illinois
Chi' tiller, raw dealer niller, thuggin' posse like thriller, pop milli's
Push poles like Godzilla, still a villa filler gorilla

Check your mouth cause you know I'm 'bout scriller
Real motherfucker from the Chi, I'm a killer
For realer, gotta set a pound like a pillar
D double O-R-D-IE iller
Crucial Conflict, we be riding high, Do or Die keep your head to the sky
Belo-Zero gotta get me by, keep on getting me high, so high

Hiding in the house, P.D., like a fresh little momma
I'm a (?) like Piranah's, have em' harm you
Screaming, stealth bomber your honor
Yea, Do or Die and this Crucial Conflict's
Trying to accomplish in all this here drama
KILO! What it be like BELO, let em' know our steelo on the D-low

We getting so high worldwide universaly where we go
Really though want the dough niggeroe I
Double A in the air when I fly
B-E-L-O and the Flict' I be gettin' high, gettin' high gettin' high
Gonna take you on an airplane ride
