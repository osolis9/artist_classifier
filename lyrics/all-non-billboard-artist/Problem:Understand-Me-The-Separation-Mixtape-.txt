feat. Wale


[Verse 1:]
Huh, make room for a real nigga when you see him
Fake nigga yeah I got the gem,
Hoe you thirsty get out my dem,
Buzzin lean for the paper, hundred proof no chaser
That's your bitch I'm a take her
You're a banker I need some cookies this mouth
Shit rap don't work, take a tookie aproach
Whole mamas for real, plow plow plow
Ye I got me a lil
Fuck that I'm ready to pop me a pill
Let's turn this motherfucker up up
Turn this fucker up
You looking too long
Boy I fuck you up
Diamond in the rough, blind when I stuck
Married to the grind bout to buy me a tuc
Nigga I'm fresh, nigga I'm next
Gold on my chest, hoes to my left
Bros on my right, this is my life
I'm about to make a movie
Ye I need to call spike

[Hook:]

Smoking I get cake, you understand me?

[Verse 2:]
Pushing down the block watching for the cops
Checking these traps looking for the gwap
Flow so clean I don't need a mop
Make the scene go dumb when the shit drop on
Ye you feel that? You feel that?
Pussy, pussy, pussy kill that I kill that
I seen her eyes now your girl she wanna chill, wanna chill at
Wanna be with a real one
That's by me, by me
I stay molly gwapped in that key big tree
Like a Forrest no Gump, I be throwing in the corner straight slumb
Thought he was a big dog now he acting like a pup
She be funny to me
Everything's about money to me
Turn a rachet to a diva
Molly all in my tequila
Jerry smoking too hatch came hot on the wrong side

[Hook:]
I don't do fake you understand me?

Smoking I get cake, you understand me?
Real nigga all day, you understand me?
It's all day, you understand me?
It's all day, you understand me?
You understand me? You understand me?
It's like this all day
You understand me?

[Verse 3:]
Where the hoes at when I'm in town?
Now where that Prozac? No I been down
Where the hoes at when I'm in town?
Where the hoes at when I'm in town?
Where the hoes at when I'm in town?
Now where that Prozac? No I been down
I'm pretty sure down the red and I was coolin
Chillin, really, my feet is on Pluto, you know
Judo with the tit game, scur that's the wood grain
Been in a couple belts, just I ain't talkin bout a big plane
Niggas skip bail, it's hatin and I see you player
And some rare SDs ain't skating neither
And yo baby momma tryna play the feel
No wonder why she wear the hat and sittin by the Laker player
Staple center 'cause we put up like 40
Italy with the homies, the Shawty want my canole
Back to LA, fly kush mele
Race down, I can make a blood, I can yele
Put it in her mouth, do you?
And everybody know when you boss, you understand me?
