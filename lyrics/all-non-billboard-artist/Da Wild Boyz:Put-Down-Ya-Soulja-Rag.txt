Put-Down-Ya-Soulja-Rag:Da Wild Boyz
Juvenile!!! Step away from the Hummer!!!
Lay down you're solja rag!!! I repeat!
Lay down you're solja rag!!!
You are not a soldier!!!

I'm bout that paper, I'm on top handlin business
You wanted beef, bitch you ain't hurt I was ignorant
You round here stuntin, you runnin off at the mouth
Jumpin off some business, that you ain't know nothin about
This shit is serious, you hear these lyrics that I'm spittin'
You see me comin, I'm get that k lets be gittin
Fire spittin, guts and brains I be hittin
Ain't back for hire, look I retire, we hittin
You spendin time, boy you done put it on my mind
Everytime you show, look you won't be hard to find
I gotta do you, tell them dope heads that I knew ya'
Wild Boyz got you through and we gonna come do ya'

*Chorus*
You ain't no solja boy
(Baby let me get the keys to the rover truck!)
Put down that solja rag

Now what's happenin with you, you dissin a nigga too
Ya tired of livin, you want ya life to be through
You gettin played by ya company, they have ya out there
You think wild boyz got headaches
Bitch you think we really care (ya understand)
You got beef with one of us
Did we do you anything (ya understand)
Do you feel like a queen
When you listenin to the king (ya understand)
Is that ya really ya style of rap
When you rap do ya brag (ya understand)
Did you used to roll with Jimmy
Do that make you a fag (ya understand)
Ya hatin Sporty T, Wild Boyz Remixin the tracks
Ain't it cold how I rap, knockin Juve off the map?
Still gonna wet the Lexus Monday
Soak the Legend Tuesday
Flip the Benz Wendesday
With a K, fuck a uzi
Ya done hooked up with Baby, ya lettin ya titties hang
Do the crowds call ya juve, jimmy call for ya his thang? (ya understand)
Ya got the projects backin, while cash money's mackin
This your style of rap I'm jackin, got wild boyz mackin' (ya understand)

Can ya handle ya business, can you open up ya own (ya understand)
Boy ya head come up missin, when ya leave ya label lone (ya understand)
Are you listenin to the words, that real soljas speak (ya understand)
Do you get paid for them concerts, you do every week (ya understand)
Do ya manager get half, and you five percent (ya understand)
Did baby take his money back, on that fifty that he spent (ya understand)
Is that really ya all hummer, you used to be a bummer (ya understand)
That nigga cut you down, when you tried to make a come up (ya understand)
Boy have you ever ride, open nothin but jive (ya understand)
Never wore Gucci, but swearin you was shive (ya understand)
Do ya drive ya own car, do baby pick ya up (ya understand)
When baby don't come and get ya, you be mad as fuck? (ya understand)
