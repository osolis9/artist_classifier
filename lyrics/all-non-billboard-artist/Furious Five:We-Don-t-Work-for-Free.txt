[Melle Mel]
In the darkness of night, huh
All the stage lights are shinin bright, hey
and we work very hard, to make you stay, RRRAAH
But it ain't no thing y'all
Cause I know that you can hang
We're not too expensive but you got, to, pay, RRRAAH

Some say the money is the root, of all evil
It's not the love, but lust of it, that makes men greedy, oooh
You said, "You wanna go for a ride? You gotta pay the fare"
So stop! You ain't got no money, you ain't got no beat
Hoooooh, say you
Got no satisfaction, won't you come and work for me
And I say to you
Can't you see baby, we don't work for free

You know you gotta live, but shit they give you stuff for free
Man these times are hard heyyy, ah don't nothin come easy-hee-ee-yeah

And my friends all say to you they say
Got no satisfaction, won't you come and work for me
And I say to you
Can't you see baby, we don't work for free

Finance, city life
You gotta work to afford paradise, huh
But if you livin in a glass house
Don't throw no stones, rrrraah!
Slave, trade, don't get laid
You gotta get paid, if you wanna go places
where you never been before
