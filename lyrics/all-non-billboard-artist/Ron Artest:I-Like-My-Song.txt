I-Like-My-Song:Ron Artest
For those who make goin' hard a lifestyle
Never waver
Nothing, gotta get it right now
I'm in the spotlight
When they turn the lights down
Only a champ swings the hardest in the 12th round

I love the 4th quarter
I love the 9th inning
I love Game 7
Bring on the competition
Cause in my heart, can't nobody do it better
Can't slow me down
Won't stop me never

I'm so Cassius Clay
I'm Tyson in 5th round
You don't leave with it
I'm Barry Bonds with mine
I beat the buzzer, baby
My stroke is hole in one
You see the checkered flag
Finish line, here I come
And I ain't gotta brag
I let the trophies do it
Around here, we the best
Now coming home, we do it
I specialize in everything that can't be done
Ain't no more talk about it
Moment of silence for the champions

They say we warriors
They say we did it again
(Hands high for the champions!)
We are victorious
We only in it to win
(Stand up for the champions!)
No surrender, no retreat
We take the battlefield over every time
(Yeah, clap your hands for the champions!)
We came, we saw, we conquered everything in sight

Moment of silence for the champions!
