Admiration:DL Incognito
You aim for the stars but I reach much higher
Talent’s out of this world, they must admire
Something pass new, can’t pass like fliers
What I fire no wires, what I try, no buyers
Make you feel small, like hoppers with messiah
When I fly you off a few lines, like cocaine sias
Saying you the kingpin of cocaine liar
Never been a part of hip hop that I desire
No prior, it’s a queen slave or a love some hate
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Always tryina move the right way
It’s like play a stound, I’m hungry as the rest
Over here there’s no cake
I need a change of pace, probably need some faith
It’s something besides papes, you know what they all say
Have faith in god it’s so many choices
So I done picked 1, most just pick none
My spideo vixens, admired by children
Your daughter looks at you and says I wanna be like them
Son looks at you and says I want a girl like them
Life imitates other little too often

What is it about me that you admire?
Stay grounded like 4 michelin tires
Well welded like 2 scoops of pliers
What is it about me, what is it about me 
What is it about me that you admire
Stay grounded like 4 michelin tires
What is it about me, what is it about me 
When I be in the cut call me incognito
Busy nigga choice that I buck for my people
When I be in the cut call me incognito
Busy nigga choice that I buck for my people
When I be in the cut call me incognito
Busy nigga choice that I buck for my people
When I be in the cut call me incognito
Busy nigga choice that I buck for my people

Not immune of the fool or my life could end soon
Rap ask more like cartoon and true
Sound booth more like I used to...you
Gotta play the cards yell like George clone
Tryina write hits locked up in my room
Asking my dudes, made this a cancoon
When I finally kaboom and all that I consume
Is the best of ...for the tools and the women
And the cars and the linen
We focused on visit on things we never been in
My dreams living in them, tryina remain driven
Without being driven, to me that’s good living
To me that’s good living, no need to beat to me
You want it, you get it, you did it
You committed to a cause, not just because
Time can’t be bought
Everybody moving at the same speed of course
Switch gears, let my foot firm to the floor
In the 7 until my last curtain call
Hell or heaven, the choice is not always yours
Even peace sometimes paired up with war
