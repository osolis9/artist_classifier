The-Broken-Spell:Armageddon
The past in me
The memories are stealing my dreams
The legacy is dividing me and
Shatters my soul

It crawls in me
It burns inside with reasons of guilt
My pounding chest
The curse of deeds is breaking the bones in me

So fast falling
Senses are growing
Black clouds are shattered
My name is spoken

When I rise from my bed as a newborn man
There's no evil dream from now on
Blood on my hands from the dance with the devil
Knowing the secret of my soul
Broken spell, the broken spell
