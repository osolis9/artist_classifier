PYT-Down-With-Me-:PYT
Tell me whose got my back
(mmmmmm tell me)
Tell me whose got my back
(PYT ohhhh)

Why do you keep hating me
All behind my back
Doggin' me
Just tell me why you can't be real with me
Cuz you're smilin' in my face
You talk behind my back
You got a problem
Maybe I can help you try to solve it
Cuz you're steady talkin' all your mess
Got me stressed
And I'm about to get my girls and handle it

What's up with all these people bein' jealous of me
Because I'm in PYT
If you got a problem you can step to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Tell me why you talk about me all the time
I got my girls with me
And I'm about to let you know what we're gonna do

Tell me whose got my back
Cuz this girl's tryna trip
And I ain't havin' that
She smiles in my face
Talk behind my back
So tell me where ya'll at
(why you wanna do this to me)
Where ya'll at
Tell me where ya'll at
So PYT tell me if ya down with me
Got my girls with me
So where ya'll at
I know ya got my back back

Why do you keep stressing me
When I'm just tryna do my j-o-b
And I'm hjust tryna have fun
But your steady in my face
You're always in the way
Ya got a problem
Maybe I can help you try to solve it
Baby what you wanna do
You know it ain't cool
And I'm about to get my girls and handle it, oh

What's up with all these people bein' jealous of me
Because I'm in PYT
If you got a problem you can step to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Tell me why you talk about me all the time
And tell me why you trippin' on me

I don't want no trouble
I'm just tryna be me (just tryna be me)
Does it make you feel good when you talk about me (talk about me)
You can say what you wanna say
You can do what you wanna do
It really don't matter
Cuz I got my girls with me, ohhh

Tell me whose got my back (ohhhh tell me)
Cuz this girl's tryna trip
And I ain't havin' that
She smiles in my face (smiles in my face talk behind my back)
