In the wrong place bout to get mean mugged, fuck it
Kill them with the kindness
Hit them with the steam hook
Bet they never expect that
Expect this
Expect the written Musinex in it errr
Pull the bad shit out you doubt you
Ever come back with a frown
Break the ice with a smile
Make you chill the fuck out
Make you realize this is our town
Friends and neighbours seem strange
Avoid the new plague
Vanilla and chocolate are the only two flavs
Nothing in the fridge that you even want to save
Leave the doggy bag and sneak out the back way
Don't stop there might as well build fortress
Look at side line with a couple torches
Couple next door seem so unfortunate
Check their trash make sure they're poor
Don't be outdone when less is less
Liven in the big city where success is stress
But they have masseuses and you are reclusive
With nooses but no friend but to kick out the stool

Robots sex

Pretty chicks listening to obscure music
Hate attention can't refuse it
Contradictions no tradition
Chivalry must be the victim
Never wanna be a Stepford wife
But in the process became the same damn thing
Every girl wanna wear the same damn ring
Bigger than their girlfriends' shame their bling
Meanwhile on the home front tame that king
Mufasa into Simba, you lost your wings
You can't even rawr, your crotch looks like pens
And you got no control so you rockin' Depends
Now your pants are shitty, your wife is pretty
But it doesn't mean shit 'cuz all she does is pity you
And your homeboys struggling to steal some freedom
Lookin' all around the house trying find a reason to leave
And so you clog the toilet with cheez-its
Go to home depot and you find Jesus
Rockin' an orange vest but you still believe him
Asking him for a hug but he just says beat it
Hesus!

Yo if you got a heater in the backseat I know you abuse it
Hate to confuse the truth but that nature is human
We're at the point now where a RoboCop ain't a movie
If you pull a gun on 'em then better holler just shoot me
Two scoops of crazy, loose screws get paid
To make monsters bigger than the last one we prayed for
A brobot so scary you would even crusade for
Even though you're the only one you're really afraid for
Oil from its tin, better drink it it's a sin if you don't you get stoned
Cuz you didn't obey Lord
Fuck that I ain't singing your hymns
You can try to enslave me when I run outta spit
But I won't cuz I got a water pistol so big
Even Jesus gets jealous when I pull that trig
Can't cover up my balls with that small ass fig
Cuz that's the same location as my fuckin' truth berry
While they do their best to keep the fuckin' truth buried
I'ma do my best to shove a shit on any motherfucker
Runnin' up on E-Dubble, tryna blow my low cover
I expose the jokes and their ugly true colours
