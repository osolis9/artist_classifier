Colossal Insight {Colossal, man}
Invites the soul {Inviting of the soapbox}
Sturdy after good food {More sturdy}
Colossal Insight {Colossal!}
Invites the soul {Inviting thy soul}
Sturdy after good food

Gracious Lord my mega Almighty
I know I been slightly
Outta your paths
Feeling the cold draught
Of the bleak winter
Splinters in my soul
I'm out of control
And I know

That I should cut down this drinking
Too many late nights and wayward thinking
Compelling a man to plan to shenanigans
They're boying me out I got to be the man again

Cos I didn't rhyme to get me rich
But I'm a scally
Two twos you'll find a switch
Hurt and pain made me
Nothing came to save me
I walk with disaster
Prefer to be plastered

Time's my master
Don't ask me for Jack Turd
All I own is my balls and my word
Nobody heard of me
Cos I'm a new man
I got this new plan
To get these new grands

Colossal Insight {Colossal, man}
Invites the soul {Inviting of the soapbox}
Sturdy after good food {More sturdy}
Colossal Insight {Colossal!}
Invites the soul {Inviting thy soul}
Sturdy after good food

People call my name
Like it's some kinda game
Like I ain't got no fame
Like I'm just the same type
Shouting out vain lights
Move your lurgy
I'm far too nervy
Observing this world

Who the weirdo
What the how the
Media whores keep shovelling powder
It's nothin' to be proud of but stuff goes on
Perceptions change
Wrong's right and right's wrong

Hoop the hoopla-ing
Devil keep snarling
Buy it buy it sell it sell it
More more more
This could well be my last LP
I've had a good run
I've made a few Gs

I've had a bag of fun
I've smoked a few trees
Now I wanna rest my knobbly knees
All in all I been feeling the pinch
And those bourgeois blacks have been far from convinced

But I don't give a damn about UK rap
I'm a UK black
Making UK tracks
And I got love for everyone of those scenes
And them pigeon-holes were never nothing to hold me
