To-Stay:Breeze
i'm tired of closing
my eyes without u
i want u closer
i don't know what to do
i see it come
i can't turn away
i'll never let u
let u go away

I make my mind up
i'd taste the love i know the game
don't wanna lose ya
don't wanna lose ya
and i never wanna let u go

everything u do commands me to stay
it's the hardest thing i'd ever have to say
cos i know that i feel light years away
everything u do now
everything commands me to stay

you're all that matters
matters to me
you're all i want now
how could i let it be
whatever happens
i'll be in ur eyes
i'll take it bck and
give it all inside

I make my mind up
i'd taste the love i know the game
d'ont wanna lose it
dun wanna lose ya
and i never wanna let u go

everything u do commands me to stay
it's the hardest thing i'd ever have to say
cos i know that i feel light years away
everything u do now
everything commands me to stay
