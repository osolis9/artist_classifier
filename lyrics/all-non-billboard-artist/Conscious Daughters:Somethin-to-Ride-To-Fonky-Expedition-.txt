Somethin-to-Ride-To-Fonky-Expedition-:Conscious Daughters
Im just ridin' slidin' lets take a little trip
CMG and K and first to make a grip
Comin' from straight from out the old so you know that
We got the funky track thats phat
But anyway its my time so let me introduce
Special one first up from the gangsta crew
Known as CCD with a title and a rep
Its quite apparent
Servin' funky shit to keep you motherfuckers starin'
Pump it up mack shit for your ears
Kick it loud and clear
Making hoes dissappear
Hittin' doughnuts in a tre' sideways to the
Next light triple sold thangs and my shits tight
Five beat mobbin through in the town
Duce tone gangsta flake with the top down
Damn this shits hittin hard in the trunk
Got me three wheel switchin' on them bitches on the next block
Headed straight to the top
And as long as my skills pay the bills
I'm a never stop
Kickin that shit you love
Pass the dank and the drank for the Bitch to buzz
Its a ghetto thang so bring the ghetto swang
Hookin' niggas they came when I do my thing
Five real g's mobbin' on a mission
Check it, its the funky expidition that we call
Something to ride to
[Chorus x8]
Expidition, funky expidition
[?]
Come and catch a thrill
With the super skill
Rhyme flowin' daughter the tack
With the neck to keep your speakers blowin
Ridin with a gat in my lap and the finger on a zap

Looking for some niggas in a cadillac
Yeah we on point rollin a point
Special wanna CMG
Blazin up a joint
Keepin a steady pace in a car race
Sidin on a strip with a grip and an 8th in my glove case
Never leavin a trace
Believing the 50's blind
Cause I fucking conscious of these streets of mine
Rollin lit with the tin shed shallow
And ill be back around the block for niggas to drop tomorrow
From east Oak to the B town looking for a freak now
Where a hella scratch to get at
Check it CMG on a mission
To get with some niggas to ride on this funky expidition
[Chorus x15]
Yeah, Conscious Daughters
All up in your trunk
Somethin to ride to
Hey yo K, why don't you step up and that ass know
Front hiss boulevard to bumpy ass trip
Homies steady clownin on the gas-break dip
Its a conscious groove
Making all my daughters move
Rollin through the town with big bass boom'
Lets get bigger on these up the street
Jack for a minute let them take us out to eat
But I concentrate on all my niggas later
I flow to this shit cause Im special and the greater
But its this funky that got me grippin still like this
Come into my show if you and you may kiss
Dont mess with the bomb
I never stress no tension
Come kick it with the daughters as we take you on a funky expidition
[Chorus x8]
