Jewelz-Time:Allen Iverson
For the year 2G the rap game change for one name
Jewelz aim to slain anything on this plane
Remains are found when the best kept secret get heated
You went platinum with a ghost writer
So in the game you won you cheated
My slang bang when you need it
You man enough to pull a gun be man enough to squeeze it
(gunshots) Die if you don't believe it
Anything to do wit millions I'mma be with it
Hats off to the hardcore niggas, fuck the rest
In my guess y'all useless, just talking music
Never mistake me for a fake MC
You got the wrong identity, nigga I'm CT fool
Get murdered in a second in the first degree
Come to me with faggot tendacies
You'll be sleeping where the maggots be
Ain't nothing kinda used to beef actually
But when it's on I raise first automatically
Won't catch me as a victim and a rap casualty
Dynasty Raiders hit VA in the summertime
Ten Bentleys in one line
Gats in each hand, twin 45's in mines
Snipers hitting niggas long distance for a rate
Sons and daughters, one order you'll be floating in water
Bad news home of the Dynasty Raiders
One love to the ol school niggas
They in the jail trying to raise us
Even the ones that tried to blaze us
But couldn't even graze us
See them bitch ass niggas y'all killing don't amaze us
Y'all slobbing I'm spitting wit a mouth full of rage

Everybody stay fly get money kill and fuck bitches
I'm hitting anything in plain view for my riches
VA's finest filling up ditches, when niggas turn to bitches
Die for zero digits; I'mma giant yall midgets
I know killers that kill for a fee
That'll kill your ass for free, believe me
How you wanna die fast or slowly?
Fast as a rolie, slow as a rolie polie
I bought your shit it was weak, trashed it now you owe me
All the hardcore niggas know me
I ain't knocking, I'm just gon' bust up in the motherfucker
Taking anything that's rightfully mines
Lust, AKs, rifles, and nines
Physique crew, thick designs
With jewels that shine all the time
Ain't nothing sweet about this rate of mystique
Got niggas while you eat shit sleep and beat your meat
Die reaching for heat, leave you leaking in the street
Niggas screaming he was a good boy ever since he was born
But fuck it he gone, life must go on niggas don't live that long
But hoes in wigs niggas that think they head strong
Got niggas hollering Jewelz dead wrong on this song
This type of murder don't need no Just forty fucking bars from the mouth of a crook
