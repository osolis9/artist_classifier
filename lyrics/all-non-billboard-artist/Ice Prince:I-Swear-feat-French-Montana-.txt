1 (French Montana)
We got big money
We drive big cars
Anywhere we go
People know who we are
I say baby I'm a star
I don't came up at the bottom
All white doubleler
All my niggas dey be whiler
Style, dance floor, passport, fly work, nice car
Price don't ask for
Crib paid cash for
Shine bright
Came from grand life
Story of my life
Money stagnant now flight
Smoke what I want
Drink what I want
With the fuckers. You expect
I don't give up at the corner
Raise the roof
Raise the roof
Ice prince Montana
We're the troop

Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me I swear
If you no soji
Have no fear
I spend money on the things I wear
Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me I swear

See
We don dey kick first
We no dey carry last
We don dey squeeze breast
Na we dey carry pass
We don dey teach them
Na we dey set class
And dem been talk say
Na my packaging go dead pass

And if you para me
E go do you like gunshot
My haters fire me
And I promise they won't stop
Now they call me Die Hard
I dey hustle till sun drop
Na we dey ball pass
Popping the best ace
I started from the bottom
Call me the next Drake
I'm fucking on your TV
Omo na Sex tape
And if na trouble you dey find
I dey my estate
Dem say I stingy die
I no dey pay attention
I pass the test of game. Amen / hey mehn
Prayer session
Abi na show money
Omo dem go fear me
Shebi na swaggu
Two chains no go near me

Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me I swear

I spend money on the things I wear
Raise the roof
Badder man here
Nobody badder than me I swear
If you no soji
Have no fear

When I dey buy the flat screen
Dem don dey write beef for my mind
That's the last thing

Cause I dey carry corpse

Enough pops

And all my records dem big
