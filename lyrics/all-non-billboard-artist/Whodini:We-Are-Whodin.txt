We-Are-Whodin:Whodini
We've got a style of our own on the microphone
And when it comes to rocking we stand alone
I'm the rapper Jalil and I'm ready to rock
And once I get started I'm hard to stop

I've got the magical touch to make you shake your butt
And Grandmaster Dee is the king of the cuts
So party people in the house make no mistake
Jalil and Ecstasy are inside the place
And

I am the man with a thousand rhymes
Couldn't say all of them in one weeks time
So I say some here, say some there

That's why people rhyme because I'm back in heat
Plus nobody knows my rhymes except me
We're the originator, not the imitator
No one rock better, no one rock greater

Now we're one for all, all for one
Yo first class ticket to havin' fun
We're going to give you what we got and baby, that's plenty
Because never have so few rocked so many

Hotter than fire, too young to retire
With a special gift to take you one step higher
We present you the American Dream
Protected and respected on the disco scene

Climbing that latter we're taking the crown
Because you just can't keep a good man down
We deserved the part from the very start
And everything we do is straight from our heart

We're the Pied Pipers of the 1980s

As you all well know we got the gusto
I'm telling you the crew is magnifico
