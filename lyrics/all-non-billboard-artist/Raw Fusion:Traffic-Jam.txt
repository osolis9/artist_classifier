Traffic-Jam:Raw Fusion
Can't you tell me what you're hiding
Behind your eyes
I think I know you
Where you come from

Same place as me
Now I feel a long way
And I met you
Seems like yesterday
That's okay

Things are changing can't you see
? the time you? from me

Do you wanna a picture
of where you've been
You can show me
I will understand
I will be your friend

I know there's been some heartbreak
At your door
Have you felt it
I've been there before
I've been there before

Things are changing can't you see
? the time you? from me

[SOLO]

Things are changing can't you see
? the time you? from me
