Go-It-Alone:Beck
I'm comin' over, see me down at the station
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jinglin' a wish coin that I stole from a fountain
That was drownin' all the cares in the world

When I get older, climbin' up
On the back porch fence just to see the dogs runnin'
With a ring and a question and my shiverin'
Voice is singin' through a crack in the window

Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na

Down on the corner see me standin'
On a makeshift home, with a dust storm comin'
In a long black shadow, pull a hammer
From a coal mine down where your daddy was workin'

Comb my hair back, strike a match
On the bathroom wall where my number was written
Drivin' on the sidewalk, lookin' back
At the sky, it's burnin' in the rear view mirror

Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

I'm comin' over, see you down at the station
By the lane with my hands in my pocket
Jinglin' a wish coin that I stole from a fountain
That was drownin' all the cares in the world

When I get older, climbin' up
On the back fence pointin' to the dogs standin' firm
With a ring and a question, dime-a-dozen
In a voice that was singin' underneath the window

Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na n
a, I better go it alone

Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na na

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
