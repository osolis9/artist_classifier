Sick-As-Me:JR Writer
However did this track, tell him prepare a hearse
This ain’t for the average rapper that will wear a skirt
Soon as I hear it I can show you they ain’t hard to kill
You learn the lyrics then you know I spit them bars for real

They ain’t sick as me, they ain’t, they ain’t sick as me
They ain’t sick as me, they ain’t, they ain’t sick as me
Do your history, lyrically I been the G
They ain’t sick as me, they ain’t, they ain’t sick as me

And I turn into the menace with the hard punches
Them niggas thought that I was finished? Far from it
Your bitches know it’s been a total fact, my flow is lit
Lamar was done with crack until he got a hold of this
I’m from the cold strip, always brick, my code is zip
Hellest niggas on the move, tryna make them motion sick
From the never tell ‘em never, never ever, ever…
Heavy cheddar better, I might pull up like they see me
Serena with a cold, bunch of buggers in my tennis
I push it to the limit, you push it as a gimmick
Probably push around the Plymouth, keep it pushing, this is business
I’m on a cheddar chase, gonna let it escalate
You be the reason why the cops run out of yellow tape
Headed straight to the set, you know we set it straight
I take offense then I’m sending you to heaven’s gates

This a victor, I laugh, tell ‘em get with me
Take his temperature and laugh, they ain’t sick as me
I go ham, beat smoking, call it hickory
Your bitch with me, she wet and I ain’t joking, slippery
History, new, new, Js on, true blue, I’m too fly, too woo
Flow crazy, coocoo
Can’t compare a rocket launcher to a tutu
I’m just too great, you’re two eight, too fool
Get with me, I’m a felon, you a misdemeanor
Saying you as sick as me, slow down on the liquor, B
Brag on, I’mma get till the cash gone
Feeling like LeBron, shooting sixty with the mask on
In your eye like a camel with the flash on
20K around my neck, I got your stash on
Tell ‘em get the tape, they don’t get enough
Well, ain’t a writer in the place who as sick as us
