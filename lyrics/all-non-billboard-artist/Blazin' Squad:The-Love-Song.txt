The-Love-Song:Blazin' Squad
Of all the clubs in all the
towns you had to walk in
mine, of all of the girls in all the
clubs you had to look so fine,
of all the sets on all the decks you
had to scream rewind, I'm so
glad that I found you girl now
lady its your time.

(Freek)
I've got this girl and she's got
hold of me, I think I love her
don't want to be free, try to
tell her but why cant she see
that I'm made for her and that
she's made for me, I try to call
her she doesn't reply, all these
questions I want to know why,
all these reasons just please
justify all these feelings inside
I know I can not hide.

(Rocky B)
When they lock me up in a
station, you wait till I got
probation, paid bail with no
hesitation, we fought but no
vexation, 'dis tings not all
penetration, long time but
no agitation, wouldn't think
I'd be in this situation, me
and you perfect formation.

(Melo-D)
Now I never wanna see you
cry, always wanna see you
smile, never gonna let you
down, always gonna be
around, girl you make my
world go round, come on
baby you be mine, never seen
you look so fine, come on
baby we got time.

(Krazy, Flava and Melo-D)
I know we belong together,
maybe you could be my lover,
I know we could last forever,
come on baby let me show ya.

(Krazy and Flava)
I love you, what you gonna
say what you gonna do,
I love you, I wanna be there
I wanna hold you, I love you,
I wanna see you smile I wanna
kiss you, I love you, its been
your time since I met you.

(Freek)
My hearts broken and its
coz of you, comtemplating
don't know what to do,
situation I cannot pass
through, and I won't change
my mind as i'm so resolute,
all this waiting is getting me
down, love of life it is you
I have found, my heads
spinning it goes round and
round so please let me tell ya
just don't make a sound.

(Reepa)
Girl its your time understand,
do you want me to be your
man, do you remember how
this began, together forever
was the plan, as time went on
and time over ran, we grew
stronger we went hand in
hand, through all the past but
still we stand, take it further let our love expand.

(Spike-E)
Girl I knew it from the star,
never gonna be apart,
do you have a Blazin' heart,
gonna save the last dance,
never gonna be far,
do you remember fast car,
I remember when you
laughed, do you have to
take the path.

(Repeat)

(Kenzie)
Girl you mean so much to me,
I know we are just ment to
be, things like this are factual,
cause this love I got is natural.

(Strider)
So girl why you blank me
every time I see ya, but ya still
wear the ice gold tings that
I brought ya, on my phone
missed calls from your
number, but wait the story
gets deeper, never answer
calls when I ring ya, always get
the same old text saying
Strider I love ya, tell the truth
and stop bein' a hater,
then maybe girl i'll believe ya.

(Repeat)

(Rocky B)
Of all the clubs in all the towns

of all the sets on all the decks

I'm so glad that I found you
girl now lady it's your time.
