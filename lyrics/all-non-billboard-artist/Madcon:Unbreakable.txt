Unbreakable:Madcon
[Hook: Tshawe]
Don't judge my way
Can't take the name
I try to be unbreakable
Don't judge my name
Can't walk away
I just try to be unbreakable

[Verse 1: Yosef]
Pushing myself to the limit, I'm trying to be the greatest
The world is at my feet, I'm just peeling off the layers
But daddy on some ''get a 9 to 5 cause it's the safest'', but
My mama told me to prepare cause we gone make it, yup
My spot is vacant
It's mine for the taking so I ride
If a dragon come alive I'mma slay it
I apply to them haters on the side, what they saying?
The size of the sun like a Goliath versus David
I know no fear, I'm a rebel on my own cost
The cost of what I do to be the greatest, that's my own loss
I'm oh so near, it's draining, but I go forth
They telling me the only way is up so I go North
The dreams of a boy, spirit of a giant
Mind of a hustler, thoughts of [?] 'em
The faith of a nation, embodiment of Zion
Walk with the motherfucking heart of a lion

[Verse 2: Yosef]
Yeah, so now I won't regard
And if I have possessions, I will sacrifice them all
And fuck if I'mma ball, the journey is my calling
My only purpose here is to be king so I'm all in (go)
I'm blind, but I'm 20/20 when I walk the line
I'm alive where so many fellas died
I rise, I'm bigger than the size that he sent me
For eyes that he said would always pray for mighty mines, tempt me
Uh, I'm growing, my spirit's overweight
My will is something you can't overrate, I'm great
Be on whatever what this world has made
But I'm tired so I'm sitting on the Empire State
With the dreams of a boy, spirit of a giant
Mind of a hustler, thoughts of [?] 'em
The faith of a nation, embodiment of Zion
I walk with the motherfucking heart of a lion

[Bridge]
Some gotta give, go
Giving it my all, 'bout to know what I'm in for
I've been a soldier in heart, neighbor, since day one
Paying my dues for the cars and it's been hard
And always, always give it my all
And always, always rise when I fall
It's okay, I won't break
Cause the lord knows that I'm
