M-I-A-M-I-:First Platoon
[Verse One]
Niggaz be sleepin on da M.I.A.M.I.
Don't even test my bottom grounds dangerous towns
Only reserve our tru representers
like my niggaz feel free to enter
Dont sleep cuz my streets won't time you,
shit'll just hitcha wit no warnin,
keep snorin we'll keep formin
hits to make these bitch niggaz think twice before yawnin
on da M.I.A.M.I., niggaz must wanna die in my area code 305
Shit be to live, to hot outside, fuck the shades
fake crews, then snooze, then wind up in the everglades
Get your first aids right away
To get rid of the battle scars that my sreets made
Niggaz backs cowards shit and try to act brave
Dont let the hooves smack the plats up out your corn braids
Ride away, nowadays crews get bruised for tryna prove shit
And comin round my dangerous towns thinkin they bullshit
Lookin all hot, aint even booted
Dont even try to squash the beef now, we dun suround your whole unit
Its a trip how quik these times change from the gauge
Now they got shit stains all in their Hanes
But whos to blame while you slept in the wrong lanes
And got fucked like them dirty bitches up in Biscayne, you knahmsayin?
[Chorus: First Platoon]

M.I.A.M.I. it's do or die
Yo you won't survive up in my streets (305)
M.I.A.M.I. nowhere to hide
Yo you won't survive up in my streets it's suicide
M.I.A.M.I. it's do or die
Yo you won't survive up in my streets (305)
M.I.A.M.I. nowhere to hide
Yo you won't survive up in my streets it's suicide
[Verse Two]
From the Keys to Orlando I got niggaz ready to blast
Don't ask who the fuck I choose stuff when you a statue
You low on ammo, but these streets is full of heat
Raisin sharp teeth right through your beef, bone appetite
Son you're too sweet, so you take shots like diabetics
The spotlight, flash a p set you photogenic
You are protected, but these streets is runnin force
Bullets all like over cross, and they saw an iron horse
Tryna show off, not in my town you gettin hauled off
In an ambulance gauged up to stop the blood loss
You life force passed the weekend, we caught you sleepin
So thats the reason why machines is now doin your breathin
It's huntin season in the M.I.A.M.I.
stay inside temperatures hot (305)
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Livin in the M.I.A.M.I. don't try to test mine
You get clapped with tech nines I'm out to get mine
So fuck the bright lights and big city
Aint nuttin pretty, the nine milli spit silly in the magic city
Cuz nighttime M.I.Action is gunclappin
Shots blastin with gats up in yo back and your life flashing
Lay shooken in your ass when you try to run some
But got stun by the assasins gun
Niggaz sleepin in the Dirty Southeast
They get they back blown out leaves the crack mouth theives
Then they bout theives, police gettin all ready see sight
For power sheets, hoodlums that run streets
The beast back the big teeth to make your body cease
Like decease, now you rest in peace
On the concrete streets where bodys lay, gotti plays
Swing around my way you float in Biscayne Bay
M.I.A.'s a jungle, survival is a struggle
You try to beat the streets and end up with bloody knuckles
Cowardly hearts with fake thugs that try to mouth
Yet they don't send nobody home in a box, in the.
[Chorus]
