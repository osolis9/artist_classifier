Cause-I-m-a-Playa:Project Pat
I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa
Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'
Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'

I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa
Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'
Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'

I'm just out here slangin' CDs nigga like rock for rockers
Still rollin' hypnotize, we quick to knock off yo' blocker
Blastin' nothin' but choppers, nigga we non-stoppers
Whippin' up this cream, real mean like Betty Crocker

The guts icy white tin, leather is what I'm lik-in'
Pull up chrome rims, didn't holla, she must be dykin'
Like she didn't see the colors change, colors on my paint job
Just like all the colors on my ice in my wrist watch

Pimps scarred, nothin' but some conversation for some dough
Slangin' these words out my mouth like I'm sellin' snow
Tellin' no lies, compromise, only cheese wise
If ya try to cross, real killers then you must die

I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa
Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'
Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'

I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa
Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'
Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'

Mackaroni Pretty Tony Snow keep it poppin'
Movin' to the Internet, keep that pussy droppin'
Mob it up, slop it up, see the ball chop it up
Whip it up, sit down on that meat I'm fit' to push it up

If that game was over I'd get some work and cook it up
Wanna show let's rook it up, you want a beat I'll hook it up
We run the streets I seen a part up in the shit I took it up
She wanted me to hit her pussy I'ma go off in her butt

What you gon' do, when that thang go to fightin'?
I'ma lay ya deep off in them hoes, them hoes be boppin'
Tellin' me to stop but bitch, I ain't fit' to stop it
Ya pussy is a pit bull bitch, gon' and lock it

Fuckin' 'round wit' me I knock ya thang up outta socket
Ya ho wanna look at me, ya bitch is outta pocket
Flyin' in the Bentley gettin' it sucked just like a rocket
Pimp C bitch I got a zoo off in my closet

I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa
Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'
Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'

I keep my cup raised up my nigga 'cause I'm a playa
Nigga 'cause I'm a playa, nigga 'cause I'm a playa
My dollars stay stackin' and nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'
Nigga 'cause I'll be mackin', nigga 'cause I'll be mackin'

Cruisin' Chelsea Avenue, in the hood it's a sunny day
Junts out, walkin' miniskirts, let them bunnies play
Money stay in a nigga's pocket wrapped in rubber bands
Seven hundred ones wit' 'bout seventy Benjamins

Understand couple hollow jackets in the barrel
Make a wild nigga wanna walk a straight and narrow
My dogs strapped on point, God we like the pharaoh
My hundred shots, comin' out the mouth of the calico

Yeah' know, mayne a nigga do's what he gon' do
I'm lookin' for some beef but the kind at a barbecue
Comin' through, flickin' old school, Box Chevy thang
Ridin' twenty two's on you fools, let the system bang

I keep my cup raised up
