Rolling-in-the-Deep-X-Factor-performance-:Misha B
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
The scars of your love remind me of us
Leave me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(We could have had it all)
Rolling in the deep
(Rolling in the deep)
Your had my heart inside of your hand
(Your had my heart inside of your hand)
And you played it, played it, played it
Strach...

Wow Wow Why Why

All tits on a world stand up
Dawa my queen's If you with me
Put your hands up up up
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rollin rollin rollin in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
Your had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, played it, played it
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rollin rollin rollin in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep)
And you played it, played it, played it to the beat
