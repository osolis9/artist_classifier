It's early in the morning and I'm feeling kind of dumb
I'm tryin' real hard but I'm having no fun
I'm looking all around and everything looks the same
It's like being the smartest kid in class and having no brain

Sharon? s right beside me
Yeah, I feel it too and if you weren? t my little brother I'll take it out on you
And d-rock and moves just lost their fat mad flow
It's just a matter of time before my brains all broke

My brains all broken but I'm feelin' alright
I feel like I'm chokin' but I'm feelin' alright
I'm goin' down fast but I'm feelin' alright
I'm not gonna last but I'm feelin' alright, feelin' alright

Bad days are givin' me the creeps
And when I have them all I wanna do is freak
And sometimes I don't feel really strong
Enough to deal with bad days 'cause they last too long

We've been thinking hard and figuring out what to make
Of all this stupid shit that makes you not think straight
So should we just quit? No, it's not cool to run
Well, you know, I think she's right, let's show 'em how it's done

'Cause it's not just a matter of straight up, holding your ground
It's all about your crew and the vibe you put down
So if we're all here, what's this about a bad day?
We're not going to take it sitting down, no way

My brains all broken but I'm feelin' alright
I feel like I'm chokin' but I'm feelin' alright
I'm goin' down fast but I'm feelin' alright
I'm not gonna last but I'm feelin' alright, feelin' alright

Bad days are givin' me the creeps
And when I have them all I wanna do is freak
And sometimes I don't feel really strong
Enough to deal with bad days 'cause they last too long
