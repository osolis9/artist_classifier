In-Tha-Air-Freestyle:Lil Snupe
[Intro:]
Lil Snupe
Yea
Same life's a fucked up shit,
Happen in my hood every day
Only the strong survive outchea
Look

[Verse 1:]
I finally became a grown man
Now my old man, prayin for my pops
Hope he end up being a strong man
I didn't have him so I had to get my own plans
Now I'm with Meek, I started getting my own grands
But my mama still struggling on the low
Kinda got me thinking, should I go pick up the dough?
And plus I got connection, they ready for me to score
But is that the life I want? Real shit, hell no
Man I'm tryin to get this rap money, fuck trap money
I want that Rolls Royce, fuck Llac money
But at the same time I gotta double back money
And it ain't nothing like the weed and the crack money
Man this shit is wrong but it feel right
I'm really outchea tryin to get this shit every night
These niggas already know that I've been earned my stripes
And shout out to Meek Mill, that nigga really changed my life

[Interlude:]
I can feel it in the air
Man, I'm far from a Harvard student
I just had the balls to do it

[Verse 2:]
Look, I'm on the throne like a king
Ridin through the Miami streets in a Phantom, this shit kinda feelin like a dream
Lookin at my niggas like, look at what we came
Look the shit we did, now we finally in the game
Yea, I started from the bottom, now we here
I said we started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Ain't no fuckin waitin on you niggas
We doin our own thing, we ain't hatin on you niggas
Just been playin A since day one, A since day one
And we got them guns and we a spray since day one
Ain't never changed, ain't never been no pussy
Always been a legend even when I was a rookie
Now all of you pussy ass niggas playin hooky but I still a kill one of you niggas if you push me
Hardest in the game and all you niggas gotta face it
I'm 2 Pac Shakur reincarnated

[Interlude:]
I can feel it in the air
I'm far from a Harvard student
I just had the balls to do it

[Verse 3:]
Look, me and my nigga used to fuck the same hoes, rock the same clothes
Now I got him on stage with me when I'm at shows
Everybody say man I ain't seen so many foes
These niggas rider came through here and they smell like drow
We smoking on that loud shit, I say that loud shit
So many white people, they tell us turn it out bitch
'Cause they say man is project nigga, he done finally get in the game
And he straight doin his thing
Yea I do this shit for my life, do this shit for my life
All them times when I was wrong say it turned out right
'Cause now I'm in that lime light and I shine right
And yo bitch keep my dick up under my right
Every time I'm in that studio
I make people pull they fuckin hair like they Coolio
'Cause they know I set it off like Cleo
My mixtape drop, I'm on the motherfuckin corner like Lebo, I'm gone
