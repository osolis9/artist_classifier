Trapped:Project Deadman
I was cold and alone and the whole world slipped away
I realized that I'm hollow, an empty shell
I heard things in Heaven, but many things in Hell
I'm so oblivious to life on the outside
My soul is a prison and my mind is the confines
There's no escape, no one to desecrate
Heart and soul segregate while inner demons congregate

There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Everybody's terrified when the darkness comes
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Everybody's terrified when the darkness comes
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done

I see mindless souls with blank stares
Reflecting from mirrors but nothing compares
Nothing will brace you, nothing prepares
For all the pain that might be out there
Life is but a dream, no it's a nightmare
Voices that scream and I cannot bare
Desensitize me till I do not care
Pulling out my soul they rip and they tear!

There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Everybody's terrified when the darkness comes
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Everybody's terrified when the darkness comes
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done

I'm trapped in Hell, can't wake from this dream
Hair standing up, see my breath as I scream
Tears roll down my face in the stream
I pray for repentance the peace be redeemed
And I know this can't replace all the hate inside me
I would take my life but would that set me free?
Go away and just please let me be!
Eternity, I cannot rest in peace

There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Everybody's terrified when the darkness comes
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Everybody's terrified when the darkness comes
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done
Everybody's terrified when the darkness comes
Close your eyes and rest in peace when it's all done
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
There's no escape, there's nowhere to run
