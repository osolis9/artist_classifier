When thew door blows in
Do you know who's coming
The wolf in sheepskin
Lock that window, hide within.

When the door blows in
Do you know who's coming
The wolf in sheepskin
Lock that window, hide within.

He'll come and seek you out
The blood on your house
Moonlit eyes deep in diguise
A friend claiming to be one of you.
