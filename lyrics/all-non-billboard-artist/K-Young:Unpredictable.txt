Unpredictable:K-Young
It seems like the same reasons I fell in love
Are the same reasons I can’t stand you now
We used to be inseparable, but people change, like the seasons
You’re unpredictable, and it’s getting pretty cold
I don’t know if I should keep the clothes 
When you take off your clothes
I, I loose it, loose it, loose it, loose it
I, I loose it, loose it, loose it, loose it
You’re just, so unpredictable

First it was lust, then we got a test
And you never worried about my past
But who wouldn’t have known that we would make it here
After a night, no, whoa
I couldn’t have known, that you would have this kind of hold on me,
Your eyes have a glow on like anything before, you’re so original

It seems like the same reasons I fell in love
Are the same reasons I can’t stand you now

When you take off your clothes
I, I loose it, loose it, loose it, loose it
I, I loose it, loose it, loose it, loose it
You’re just, so unpredictable

Can I touch you girl? Can I count on you
Can I be the one, to put it down on you
So light the candles baby, cause your body is a canvas
Let me paint it for you! Yeah
I know what you want, so let me undress you
Girl stop the talk, spare me your lecture
And get a second change, to make a first impression
And I can love you better
Ain’t it ironic baby girl
