Crowd-Pleasa:El Da Sensei
This land is mine, God gave this land to me
This brave and ancient land to me
And when the...
pop
uh
hot shit
pop shit
uh yeah
c'mon
one, two, oh, oh, oh
Wooo
Yeah
mm

Now when the pen hits the pad
things start happening
major freak of nature
all pro for splattering
my chattering is patterned
disease is what I greed
in excess of trees
a lavish home is all I need
Oh
prolific gent
is here to present
my testament at all closed-circuit events
Respect the essence and build on my landfill
I'm so ill like a film time to kill real
To my duties in-laws
Refresh all y'all
with the greatest of songs that can never go wrong
Back and forth realizing
what you been missin in lyrical exercising
It's no surprising that I'm bringing the goods
Swinging the wood like . host?
Prepare for a new host

I'm transmittin live with the hardcore style
x2

focus daily
my platform's stacked with choice invoice
strapped to the vocal that most consider moist

duncan hines rhymes
brownie points for the incline
slice your spinners
and embarrass you in tournaments
don't forget when I step on the scene
the butcherous, glorious
lethal in fact
styles come in stacks of ten
captain of the ship
buckaroo banzai
master of the sword like Li Mu Bai
in it for the cash, and the flash, and the gusto

take a minute to reflect as I take it from the top

I'm headed for the Triple Crown
World renowned
All purpose for the sprint
breakin shit up into fragments
The unflappable, hard like granite
granted with the gift that'll spread across the planet
true dat

advertise myself, but never dramatize

I'm well-spoken like speakers at charities
Narratives that'll give
(woo)
Car bombs and whole beats that explode
