Trapped-On-Earth:Savage Brothers & Lord Lhus
They believed that they were free but in reality they were trapped by their own selfish and greedy desires. American society was not going forward; it was taking people backwards. They were becoming isolated beings driven by primitive animal forces.

Trapped on Earth, yeah that's our predicament
Ask what it's worth, now shit if your position is the path to burn
Listen to us initiative
Blast to burn only if it's living dividends

Trapped on Earth, yeah that's our predicament

Yo Im dangerous, man your battle station, it's cold war
Stand behind bricks like coke lords
Stories passed down from the ghettoist folklore
And if you ain't on top yet then smoke more
Presidential glitch, who the fuck did we vote for?
The man with the hundred brick stash in the boat floor
Bush made a war in Iraq now shit's crazy
Known put a shell in your face like Dick Cheney
The Ghetto Dick Tracey, I done seen me a lot of shit
Trapped on Earth under reign of a communist
Waiting for the Planet X to bring the apocalypse
Sick of these whack rappers getting monotonous
Move through your city like the damage of tidal wave
Gave the hammer to the man and told him to pound away
We can build empires, move with the cavalry
Get knocked the fuck out, see more stars than outerspace

I done seen a lot of shit since the days of my birth
From living on this planet, we call it trapped on Earth
Backbone verse is what I give you destined to distribute
Tribute to hip hop, the real shit always continues
Son I keep it real without a record deal, we can build
Parlay on the track take a trip to Dr. iLL's
Reminisce about back in the day we wasn't stressing
We ran the streets, choking off trees, the cipher blessing
See my life is a lesson, each day's another pop quiz
Watch this, they found my cousin dead inside his whip
Why the good die young? Why they murder Big L?
Why I walk the streets, no peace, know living Hell?
Put my uncles in jail, wrong decisions got him sitting in detention
This life we living got us screaming out, "Fuck the system."
Peace to The Snowgoons, peace to the fam
Bloodline, ain't no stopping me now
I'm coming out, it's my time

Uh, we're coming to the end of our days
And the way shit's going we ain't far from our graves
Yo this really ain't adding up
Sometimes I just want to bag it up
Life is ill son, I've had enough
Kids killing kids, people kill their families
People starving in the streets, that's the reality
Now you got that family that's all about vanity
Crazy kids in college don't want em to work hourly
For that same salary we should act cowardly
Send another child to war then leave casualties
The rich get rich, the poor keep on missing
Cause they cut education to further the prison system
See we trapped on earth, I've been trapped since birth
All you fake motherfuckers take your mask off first
So I can look you in the eyes before I take you to church
Put you right back in the earth, casket and dirt
