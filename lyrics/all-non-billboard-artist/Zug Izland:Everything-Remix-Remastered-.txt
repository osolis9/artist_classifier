Everything-Remix-Remastered-:Zug Izland
You've got your blind indecisions
of all the things they say
This is your life this time
Live it how you may

Give one man powers to kill
and one man hands to heal
Left one man suffering
All I want is everything

All I want is
All I want is
All I want is
Everything

They got the door wide open
Won't you walk on in
We're going for a freak ride
won't you take a spin

Ok, this will be the last chance
to now make it right
If someone tries to stop 'em
stand your ground and fight

Give one man powers to kill
and one man hands to heal
Left one man suffering
All I want is everything

All I want is
All I want is
All I want is
Everything

Everything everything
Everything everything
Everything everything
Everything everything

I want, everything
Everything, everything

Give one man powers to kill
And one man hands to heal
Give one man everything
Still others left suffering

Now the thrill of living
stay on the right path
When Death is calling
you can't take it all back
can't take it all back
can't take it all back

Give one man powers to kill
and one man hands to heal
Left one man suffering
All I want is everything

Give one man powers to kill
and one man hands to heal
Left one man suffering
All I want is everything

I want
I want
I want is everything!
I want
I want
I want is everything!
