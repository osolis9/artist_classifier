Miles-Away:Kasino
Don't open your eyes
The world you're in is much sweeter
Don't let the light
Betray the things you're seeing
The world will crash in soon enough
The day will fade your colours
And though you're close enough to touch
You're miles away
Hold on to fairy tales
And fly to special places
Always incredible
The sights, the sounds, the faces
The world will crash in soon enough
The day will fade your colours
And though you're close enough to touch
You're miles away
And I would join you if I could
If I could find a way, I Would
But some things aren't for sharing
And when you smile I wonder why
And wish that I could be Inside your head right now
The world comes crashing soon enough
The day will fade your colours
And though you're close enough to touch
You're miles away
