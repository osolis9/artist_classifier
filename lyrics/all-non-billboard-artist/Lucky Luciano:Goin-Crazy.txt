Goin-Crazy:Lucky Luciano
I'm going krazy for you (yeah heyy)
I'm going out of ma mind just thinking about you
Another day of ma life baby without you
I'm going krazy I'm going krazy

Yea I'm with her but I'm thinking about you
Can't get you off ma mind baby what am I gonna do
Had it all but now it's gone
Feelin so alone wanna pick up the phone & tell you come back home
Still smell your ed hardey perfume on ma sheets
It's so hard for a rapper not to cheat
The women and the liqour had me blinded
I'd give it all up 4 ya I promise

Act like it don't phase me but I'm going krazy don't wanna
Spend another day without ma lady huuh
I miss you girl and the money ain't nothing I'll give you da world

I'm going out of ma mind just thinking about you
Another day of ma life baby without you
I'm going krazy I'm going krazy

She was with me through it all when I was broke when I ball
Now I'm waiting by the telephone for her to call
Had a star on ma team but I messed that up
I know I did you wrong just way to much
Let me get ma life together and I'll be right there
Hope your still waiting for me I know it ain't fair
Ring on your fingre your name on ma arm
She wanted me to change but I could'ntso
She gone
See the only girl that know me all the responding*
I miss the way you kiss and the way you hold me
Wake up in a big house all alone now
I don't want the fame just give me ma girl

I'm going out of ma mind just thinking about you
Another day of ma life baby without you
I'm going krazy I'm going krazy

I know they don't love me they just know lucky
You would dine with me before I got the money
That's why I need you for ma mamacita
To c me going out ma mind kuz I can't see ya
Never know what you got till it's gone so if you got a good women then don't
Do her wrong
Man I should of kept her when I had her nahh
I hope somebody don't grab her

I'm going out of ma mind just thinking about you
Another day of ma life baby without you
I'm going krazy I'm going krazy
