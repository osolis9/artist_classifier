Misery-Bonus-Track:ATL
A couple white lines in the night, we drive a silver-flood machine
Daddy had me a surprise, a trip to London and Paris
Open my pocket, bunch of bills, no pretty woman could resist
I could bet it on you even the biggest amount, feel like in Vegas tonight
Wake up in a suite, nothing like going up the beach
In a Jacuzzi whit the drinks, fill whit martini Ma Cherries
don't care what's happet to us, we can afford it whit some bucks
They say we'll soon be in bankrupt, we're up to Misery
Got a really big check for my really big mount
I'll spend it just to have Frankie on my song, Yeah
We're super rich kids laughing all night long
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah come play with us
Am I wasted already?
Can't tell if I'm going crazy
Oh my God, I can barley hold my breath
When you say that we're going up to Misery
Wake up in a suite, nothing like going up the beach
In a Jacuzzi whit the drinks, fill whit martini Ma Cherries
Don't care what's happet to us, we can afford it whit some bucks
They say we'll soon be in bankrupt, we're up to Misery
