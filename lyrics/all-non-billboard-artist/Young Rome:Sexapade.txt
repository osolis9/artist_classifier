Sexapade:Young Rome
Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade
Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade

Baby you beautiful you dress so provocative
But why the hell you gotta be so damn talkative
Your stories too long, your skirt is short
Your home girls makin' me dizzy smokin' them new ports

Now I been drinkin', me and Marques by the bar
And I hope the henny ain't makin' you look like superstar
'Cuz I ain't tryna wake up flippin' and mad
Wit a broad who resembles Donovan McNad

My homey black told me you was a dime plus
You smelled so good that you cleared his sinus
Lips so full keep my helmet shined up
Girl lets go somewhere nobody can find us

Cool what's your name again? Jeremy, Jerrod, Jerome
All I know my last name is Jones
Girl believe me when I'm through with you
I guarantee you'll forget your name too, ooh

Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade
Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade

Your body's vicious, delicious momi blowin' me kisses
Fly misses [Incomprehensible] and jellyfishes
Girl I'm drunk and I see you high
And I ain't tryna drive and catch a DUI, uh ah

Back seat of my jeep, lets swing a episode
Hold up let the CD change and load
I'm 'bout to let you have it to Lenny Kravitz girl
Lets pretend this escalade seat is a craftmatic

I'm like a jack rabbit, hope you ain't asthmatic
Baby just drop your thong like a bad habit
We gonna have this ally smoking like a cookout
The big homey Vern got us covered, he the look out

Got my truck rockin' like monkeys fightin' in it
Use your [Incomprehensible] like pro tool's and I'll shag in it
And after the back shots its time to go back in to V.I.P
Actin' as nothing happened, holla

Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade
Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade

Yo, yo I know you wanna hit it, get up in it and kill it
So you can run back and tell yo homies how we did it
My booty firm and chunky, I ride it like a donkey
Skeet skeet stop frontin' boy you know you want me

You wanna turn me out, turn me on, turn me over
Turn me into a freak and get me started like a motor
You know I can't stop let me get on top
My booty wiggle like jello on the real watch

Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade
Come jump in my escalade, I'm so drunk I forgot my name
All I wanna do is get laid, come join me in my sexapade
