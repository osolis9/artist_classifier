Put-It-Up:Paulie Rhyme
Put it up if you feeling the vibe,
Put it up whether day or night,
Put it up if you loving your life,
Whether a fist or peace sign,
Put it up, Put it up
The rat race make you feel like you running in place,
You take haste make you feel like it's all a mistake,
So you vacate, when you should really be them planting roots,
Seeds looking for you, like trying grow without food,
Be a father to your son, because you only get one chance,
Eyes on the prize, cause our future is they hands,
Need to man up, give these queens some assistance,
Act a King, and spend a minute with your kinfolk,
Ain't all about paper, it's more about time
Spend a little, so you really know what's on they mind,
Conversation like education, give them a voice,
Lethem know right from wrong, so our people have a choice,
One hand washes the other; both wash the face,
Teach them to be a prince, don't condemn to last place,
Mind terrible waste, but a little is hope useful,
World will never change, if we don't help the youth grow…
Put it up if you feeling the vibe,
Put it up whether day or night,
Put it up if you loving your life,
Whether a fist or peace sign,
Put it up, Put it up
Now it can be tough be one on one,
But if you committed, then make them feel it,
Sometimes love is best when they hear it,
And I ain't telling you how to run your house,
But if you live with her then you might want to take her out,
The grass will always seem greener,
Bright lights, skin tights, is cool for club peoples,
And it's even cool to kick it in,
But after the fun, who's the one that's always listening,
Who probably got you them clothes that you strutting in,
Who going be rubbing on your face when you stumble in,
Who is down is from the jump, the middle, the end,
If it's all the same person, that's the one to worry about then,
Before they let you go, you better Lethem know,
Cook a meal, run her bath, just let it show,
Who really mean the most, who really is the one?
Cause if you don't, somebody will get it done…
Put it up if you feeling the vibe,
Put it up whether day or night,
Put it up if you loving your life,
Whether a fist or peace sign,
Put it up, Put it up
