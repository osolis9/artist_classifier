All-In-the-Game:Prime Minister
All in the game, All in the game
All in the game, Lift yo hands in the air
All in the game, All in the game
All in the game, Lift yo hands in the air
One, two, three, I'm calling for my brothers come and pray with me
Because we all in the same thing, Because we all in the same game
No time to pursue a discord among the brethren, no matter what coloring
We all been cleansed from the life of sin
now time to let that holy ghost come on in
Now just man have falled 7 times
but just because he fall don't mean the brothers blind
Because once he arise he stand taller than the baller man
I think I can, I think I can
I think I can because of the blood that was shed for me
I know I can, greater is he who live is me
Uh yes I can, I know I can, I can if I wanna
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
It really saddens my heart to see a brother bound,
And instead of help them understand we wanna tear em down,
What the problem with the body, too much jealousy?
We've been called to do a work to set the lost free
But instead we hurt each other through the words we say
Instead of seeking the Lord, falling on our knees to pray
We've got the power of life and death through the tongue,
it's a shame to see a baby in a body with they head hung
Cause you can kill them spiritually through your accusations
Did you examine yourself first, what yo occupation?
You a minister, not a judge with a mallet
Let he without sin throw the stone, cast a ballot
How can we save souls when in the church we got confusion
God didn't offer that man, it's just a spiritual illusion
We supposed to be blood brothers, blood washed by the Son
Wanna judge better read Galatians 6 and 1
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
Making noise with my boys, Illinois ain't no joke
Get the anointing, start whooping some folks
Hit em hard with with slinging the gospel rap,
Didn't know your arm is too short to box with God
You done tried everything, thought the hoods would bow
I'd heard in the yard your a Muslim now
Who's the light? Who's the truth? Who's the way?
Who's the only living God that got out of the grave?
But my saved, believe me, ain't no words to rhyme
From earth to heavens, holy spirit in the middle
I can't stand to see my friends in hell
chasing these false type of Gods, and these trends they fail
Can you tell a real fire and feel it when it's hot
It's coming through to burn you up everything you got
From blocks to crack rocks, blocks n knots, the spots
and jack slots from bottom and back tops
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), Lift yo hands in the air (we ca do that yeah)
All in the game (we ca do that yeah), All in the game (we ca do that yeah)
