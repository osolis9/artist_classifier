All this Shmoney in my pocket cause I'm lit

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebbel]
Man, all this Shmoney in my pocket, bitch I'm lit
And Gun Squad, G-U-N, we the shit
All my niggas G-S-9, boy that's it
And free my hots cause I'm a hot with the shits
Now let me tell you who is not with the shits
The other side cause they ain't ride ever since
I'm G-U-N, bitch, I'mma ride with a gun
I'm G-U-N, bitch, I'mma die with a gun
Bro, all this Shmoney in my pocket, watch me blow it
I do my dance on the bean, bitch, I'm rolling
All this Shmoney in my pocket, watch me blow it
She bust a dance on my dick and bust it open

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Bitch, I'm the trap god, I'm still trapping hard
I'm still talking 'bout them chickens in the wall
You don't Shmoney dance then you don't Shmoney talk
I call my Shmurdas, tell my Shmurdas set it off
And when my Shmurdas set it off they leaving chalk
Bitch, we the hottest thing coming out New York
I walk up in the party, I just came to ball
I do my Shmoney dance, now she on my balls
Now you boys ain't 'bout that Shmoney, you need to stop it
I call my Shmurdas, have 'em popping at your noggin
I said you boys ain't 'bout that Shmoney, you need to stop it
I call my squad and have you popping at your noggin
Squad!
