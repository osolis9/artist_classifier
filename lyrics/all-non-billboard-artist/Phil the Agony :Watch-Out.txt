Watch-Out:Phil the Agony 
Oh no, here's another banger,
We got it popping from London to Atlanta.

I'm picture perfect, babe, go and get a camera,
My presence got me feeling like sand, and it got me sad.

Oh, no, fresh out of Uganda,
But I can have a girl wondering where her pants are.
Give her a rose and have her feeding like Amber
Then go back to my place for Ribbonanza.
Alphabet lifestyle from M to the E,
The girl used to call me sugar, cup is still empty.
And the name starts with E, so I gotta be overseas,
Catch me somewhere on the B E A to the C H, double S, I'm the G.

Oh no, here's another banger,
We got it popping from London to Atlanta.
I'm picture perfect, babe, go and get a camera,
My presence got me feeling like sand, and it got me sad.

Oh, no, I'm lying to let them know
Cause I'm going in the best, I'm like LA's goal.
Yeah, they roll, bro', like before they end the show
Cause we gonna eat together like staples in a central foam.
I'm on money like there isn't one to tell me no.
You guys got amnesia, cause you never know.
Why you feel bad, cause you gotta let us all
And they steal gas like they stole from Texaco.

(Hook)
Oh no, here's another banger,
We got it popping from London to Atlanta.
I'm picture perfect, babe, go and get a camera,
My presence got me feeling like sand, and it got me sad.

Oh, no, this track can be a charter,
I'm for this UK news can come to make things harder.
Most of these girls are getting smarter,
They told me no, cause that be â€˜maybe'
Hm, is that your final answer?
Maybe I'll leave, but I'll be back to find you after,
Who's the bully, who's picking on somebody's partner?
Well die, I can hear this tracking honor, I'm young money, call me mister Carter.

(Hook)
Oh no, here's another banger,
We got it popping from London to Atlanta.
I'm picture perfect, babe, go and get a camera,
My presence got me feeling like sand, and it got me sad.
