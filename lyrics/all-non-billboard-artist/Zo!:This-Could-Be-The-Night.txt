This-Could-Be-The-Night:Zo!
Ask any girl in this lonely world
Ask any girl, she'll say
Make it last forever
I'm holding out my hand
I finally understand

So turn out the lights
(Oh yeah)
We'll make it last
Forever

I've been down the streets of desire
Sometimes I was so uninspired
You found what was
Locked up inside of me

This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights
I've always been the one

Lovin' on the run
That's when you came undone, oh girl
Why do you wait for me?
Out on the borderline between the hurtin' lies
And the true emotions
That make it last forever

This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights
I've always been the one

I've been down the streets of desire
Sometimes I was so uninspired
You found what was
Locked up inside of me

This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights
I've always been the one

This could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
Oh, to end all nights
I've always been the one

To end all nights
