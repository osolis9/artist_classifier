I Remember You
Your Love Is Ooh
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby

(verse)
I contemplate, as we lay
Caught up in your web of pleasure
Let me get my thoughts together
Concentrate, stimulate
Ecstacy cannot be measured
I finally found my treasure

(chorus)
When I think about the love we make
I can't find the word to say, your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
When I think about the the love we make
I run out of breath and I start to shake
your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby

(verse)
Take the sun
Take the moon
All I ever need is you
You make my dreams come true
Through the storm, nice and warm
Girl you know just what to do
You know just what to do

(b-sec)
I'm just an ordinary man
I don't understand
Why the way that I feel gets so hard for me
To explain
Am I dreamin'?

(chorus)
When I think about the love we make
I can't find the word to say, your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby
When I think about the love we make
I run out of breath and I start to shake
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh baby

(bridge)
And my heart is beating, sore from being
Loved so beyond my needs
All I know is I want the world to know
Your love is ooh
Your love is ooh
Your love is... ooh

Ooh, Ooh, Ooh (continue w/ ad lib and fade)
