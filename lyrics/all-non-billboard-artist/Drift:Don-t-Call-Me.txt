Don-t-Call-Me:Drift
[Molly]
Just walk to this
Don't be afraid
People walk to this

Just walk to this
Don't be afraid n*gga
Walk to this

Just walk to this
Don't be afraid
Bitches walk to this

[Drift]
Yo I wish I never met this girl
(what you say?)
Said god has blessed you girl
You very special girl
Yeah right girl you talk too much
(what you say?)
I said I'm lost in lust
You got the softest touch
Its too bad your head is hard as a brick
(what you say?)
Said your my heart I admit
When we apart I get sick
I'm only sick cause you aint chewin no gum
(what you say?)
I said you're beautiful hun
You got you're cuticles done
Shit shoulda fixed that raggedy weave
(what you say?)
No man's as happy as me
Since I'm a daddy to be
Even though I know that this baby aint mine
(what you say?)
I said my lady is fine
She got the crazy behind
But your sister ass is fatter then yours
(what you say?)
I said the cash in the drawer
Mami bring a sandwich back from the store
Before I'm tappin your jaw
(what you say?)
Your love is crackin for sure
I'm comin back for some more
She said

[chorus: (Drift) & Molly]
Soon as I get home I'll give you a call boo
(Don't call me, I'ma call you)
I'ma take you out to dinner and maybe the mall too
(Mami don't call me, please I'ma call you)
Maybe later we can chill my crew and your crew
(Don't call me, I'ma call you)
I'll be waitin by the phone till the call come through
(Just don't call me, I'ma call you)

[Molly]
Ayo I wish I never met this dude
(what you say?)
God has blessed you dude
You very special too
Yeah right boy you lost your touch
(what you say?)
I said I'm lost in lust
With such an awesome thug
It's just too bad your dough aint long as your dick
(what you say?)
When we just runnin the stick
I empty all of this clip
I woulda never thought that you was a punk
(what you say?)
I said it's you that I want
Them otha losers is chumps
Now won't you run and smoke a bag of some glue
(what you say?)
I said my man is the truth
And that I'm glad I pursued
I damn near passed out seein your face
(what you say?)
Them n*ggas feind for a taste
They wanna be in your place
This n*ggas stupid thinkin he gettin some brain
(what you say?)
I said I lose it
Everytime they mention your name
You just don't know I'd rather be with your man
(what you say?)
I'm lookin forward to tonight
Hope you aint makin no plans
He said

[chorus: (Molly) & Drift]
Soon as I get home I'll give you a call boo
(Baby don't call me, I'ma call you)
I'ma take you out to dinner and maybe the mall too
(Baby don't call me, I'ma call you)
Maybe later we can chill my crew and ya'll crew
(Don't call me, I'ma call you)
I'll be waitin by the phone till the call come through
(Just don't call me, I'ma call you)

[Drift]
Yo see Drift has balled before
And I'ma ball some more
Girl I got what I needed
What I'ma call you for
See ma believe me
I'm doin you breezy
Next time you see me
Will probably be TV
If you wearin a bra and panties
Then lady you overdressed
Loosen up some
Drop your pants and show your breasts
Soon as the fun is over
I'm leavin her all depressed
Like don't call..
Nah forget it you know the rest

[chorus: (Drift) & Molly]
Soon as I get home I'ma give you a call boo
(Mami don't call me, I'ma call you)
I'ma take you out to dinner and maybe the mall too
(Mami don't call me, please I'ma call you)
Maybe later we can chill my crew and your crew
(Don't call me, I'ma call you)
I'll be waitin by the phone till the call come through
(Just don't call me, I'ma call you)

[Drift]
Just walk to this
Get on the floor baby
Baby walk to this
Don't be afraid
People walk to this
Walk to this
Get on the floor
People walk to this
Baby walk to this
Don't be afraid
People walk to this
