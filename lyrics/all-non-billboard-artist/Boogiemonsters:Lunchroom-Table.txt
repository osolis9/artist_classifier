Aiyo, save me, save me a seat, yo
Yo, ain't no skippin in line
Ain't no skippin in line!
You can't skip in the line
Get off me, man!
Mr. Hightower, Mr. Hightower...
Yo, where my man M-o at?
Yo yo!
Yo, what's up, yo?
Come over this way, yo
Hit that beat for me one time, you know how we do

Uh, Black Hole Sun, Vortex
Six million ways to die, I choose none
Vortex got demons on the run
Vortex out to slay Satan before the day is done
Vortex, I'm like brave Grandmasters of kung-fu flicks
Movin words of perfection in every direction
Convection heats up the microphone I freeze
When I bust Jehova bring breeze to a gust
Thrust my rhyme through the woofers and the tweeters of your speakers
Sound is below zero
The mic's two tons in my hand on the ground
I lift it to my brain, no strain, let it snow brimstone when I rain
I'm vertical, move it in nautical miles of styles
Volatile vocal ( ? ) bionics moving physical bodies with third eye
Grandmaster of intellectual power, how much can a black hole devour
All that's in the world with my gravity
7 point in my brain, poke this through your chest cavity
Rhymes get complicated when they activated
The devil hestitated, in battle got designated, now I made it
To the top of Mount Zion, holy Mount Zion
( ? ) they banter, soldiers of ( ? )
I be generatin on my energy like gamma
Just wanna kick a rhyme like my grandma
Let that lyric through your dome
Travelling through your veins and your brain
I'm Jah cyclone
So as I conject a microphone dissector
Bring it back, wheel it up, selector
Ha-ha, ha-ha
Yeah
