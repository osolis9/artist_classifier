Some niggas blood and some niggas crip
Some niggas thugs and some niggas is bitch, what?
Some niggas ain't got nothin', some niggas rich, you heard?
Some niggas die frontin' and some livin' this shit, for real

Ayo, we play for keeps, start from day one
Hot we blaze the heat, 360 ways to eat
Razorblades you need
I'm gettin' somethin', if not then I'm hittin' somethin'

Definitely, especially if my rims is touchin'
Out for mine, for your shines
I blow you out your mind, you can throw a 1000 signs
I'm only concerned about the dollar signs

Stackin' my cheese
Stashin' my crack in back of my feet
State to state, nationally, actually, factually
I fracture every member of your faculty

Send your cavalry
I got and 1's that match with me, city capture me
I have them niggas scared to act with me
Throw your man off the Tapp-an-zee

Other members of your clan runnin'
Where the traffic be
Hollerin' and he bustin' big guns
And comin' after me

I'm willin', real live shit, ain't no acting B
It's not a game, we ain't playin'
Dunn we prayin'
Won't stop till everyone layin' on the pavement

Every nigga you came with
Is gettin' painted
We specialize in wet-in guys
Technical lies, Smith-n-Wessunalise

I seen the best of them die
Especially Test and I, put the tek to ya eye
So you can see death
Take a deep breath and say goodbye, why?

Streets is too real, thugs nowadays is too ill
Fuck a hundred thou I need a few mil
Even if it means you kill
You restin' in peace I rest in blue steel

I'm even wet-in police and navy-blue seals
How crazy you feel?
Militant Click, ten in the whip
I know Bohemians wit plenty of chips

Pull this off and we'll be rich
Filthy as top, bill the milkiest
In the hamptons
I know the mansions, where they live

They on some rims shit
Hindu niggas reading Sanskrit
I wanna man by every exit so they can't split
Rush the crib, all we see is candles lit

Yo they got gold cows
Gold owls on some chain shit
Tied them up, red dot 'em up
Fuck the ransom shit

Hit the safe, brick city case, back to the whip
Then we lace, back to BK
All beneath, relaxed in the PJ's
Splittin' mathematics on the weekday

Sound of pee traces
Dust the side of briefcases
Quiet money, eat by my chef
Like Free Masons, pay me
