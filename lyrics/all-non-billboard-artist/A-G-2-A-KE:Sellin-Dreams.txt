Sellin-Dreams:A-G-2-A-KE
Woke up early, to my mama screaming get up
Die young, I'm out here hustling to better us
(boy you better get your ass up) I'm up, (go to school) man skip school
She's a fool I use to think, I'll take that five and go get dank
Right before I sneak a drank, I'll be out the do'
And left mom's a nice fat bank roll, in the dresser drawer
Shhh, let me count my do'
One... two... fo', like she didn't know
Was young and silly though, cause she knew what I use to do
Through the hood I'd clown putting it down, stealing motherfuckers sound
Smoking quarter pounds with my niggas
And bitches that can keep it wild when I'm around, what's up what
What is this shit, I'm getting older now I know what thangs suppose to be
The old B 28, and you done slid me 25 point 3
(naw man, I was just trying to see what was on your ki)
And see my cubes fool, don't belong to you they belong to me
So miss me with that bullshit, and give me the full shit
Hell I know my scale'll tell, the same story that your scale tell
But I'm about my mail, you know G nigga
Just because your train of thought, derailed figure you'd go

Selling dreams coming clean, diamond infested bezeltynes
That gleam, everytime light beams you fiends for that Rolex I just seen
Dreams, having a Lexus coach edition
Like I got a team means, I don't need your help to help me dream
