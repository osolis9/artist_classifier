Do-It-Like-This-:Black Eyed Peas
Hey, I bet you can't, bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't do it like this

1, 2, 3 to the 4
Coming to your hood like a sky missile
Fergie, rock the beat down to the gristle
I spit it clean just like Listerine

I'm so official
That's why I'm rocking this, rocking this whistle
I'm in the disco, pretty lady nipples
When I DJ, I turn the base off the tickle

The girls with the big, big booties
I'm straight chilling, cooling out with cuties
21 and over ain't messing with juvies
Girls always talking about, I ain't no groupie

I ain't stupid, I know what the truth be
You was up chilling with Yeezy last week
You nasty, admit you nasty
Trying to act classy, ask for a glass, please

Grab a glass and get what?
Ask for some bubble so I can get 'em all wet
I said I don't want trouble but she said wanna get busy
'Cause she dizzy so I said let's jet

We did it and we did it
And we did it like this
Did it and we did it
And we did it like this

Did it and we did it
And we did it like this
Did it and we did it
And we did it like this

I said, bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like that
Bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like that
Bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like that
Bet you can't, bet you can't

Do-do-do it like me, so fresh, so clean
This beat's crazy, this beat's obscene
This shit's laced with shit so mean, mean, mean
You're not mean

This beat's cracked out, means ya'll fiends
This shit's hot, nigga, letting off steam
This is like a movie action scene
Ring, ring, ring like a machine

This shit's money, nigga, this shit's green
This shit's is terrifying Halloween
This shit's gimme your qu-qu-queen
That means I'm the what, what king

Bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't, yo, yo, yo, yo

Rock the house, bro, rock the dancer
I want pilates, someone gimme belly dancer
Who got the answer for the dancer
Nobody know but I got music to announce ya

Blo-blocker, mama call me papa
I stay on toppa, quick chicks like Chaka
Zulu, I'm the shit, you the copper
Who are you, I'mma future hip-hopper

Mega nigga, this nigga, nigga
Why hold the gun if you cant pull the trigger?
Why say you can do it when you can't deliver?
Why a drink vodka if ya got a weak liver?
Ha, ha, ha, ha

I'mma lover, not a fighter
Love down a dike turn her to a dick liker, ha, ha, ha, ha
I'm the big chief rocker
Shootin' up your block like blocker, blocker

Bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't rock it like this
Bet you can't, bet you can't do it like that
Yo, try it, tr-tr-try it

Can't rock it like this

I'm the new mic matic, black acrobatic
Alien about to invade galactic
Ladies fly maxim off a my asset
Filipino comin' to the U.S, smash it

Laser, flash it, big ghetto blastic
Vodka, water, time for some action
Check it out now, the funk's so brother
And right about now, you now I'm on that other

Shit but you can't rock it like me though
Niggas say I'm dope, white girls say I'm Neat-o
I rock reforms, ain't with no needle
Music revolution like underground beetles

Yeah, you can't rock it like us, bitch
You need to shut the up

I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
Start the ignition, let's blow it up like nitro glycerin
It's the new definition of club demolition
Check the new composition
Bless ya down with killer ammunition

I got a proposition, stop, listen
'Cause this beat bang's a banger, like a macho submission
I got a intuition, tonight's gonna a good, good exhibition
Hope you don't have no heart condition
Think you could rock it like this? You wishin'

You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this

You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
