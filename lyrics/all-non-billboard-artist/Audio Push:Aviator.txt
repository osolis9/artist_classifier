Aviator:Audio Push
[** feat. Brandy:]


[Brandy:]
I'm flya then a motha sucka*
Like an Aviator (2x)
You know you can't touch me
'Cause I'm somehwere in the clouds
I'll be lookin' up or
I'll be lookin down
Flya then a motha sucka
Like an Aviator (2x)

[Price:]
Whatcha doin? Press pause
We might can share time
I got so much keys
That maybe we can share mine
Catch me up in the air
I'm starein widda nice dime
I'm in the clouds
So now they call me Price-Airlines
Now you can try and tell me
Who can hold these streets
Or name a badda rapper
Who can hold these beats
I keep rasisin the bar
While yo flow decrease
'Cause where I'm viewin from
Is passed the nose bleed seats

[Brani:]
I'm flya then a motha sucka
Like an Aviator (2x)
You know you can't touch me
'Cause I'm somewhere in the clouds
I'll be lookin' up or
I'll be lookin down
Flya then a motha sucka
Like an Aviator (2x)

[Oktane:]
Now lemme lemme lemme tell
Hello to all y'all
We flyin' ova here
And you look so small
Girl I'm so fly
I'm never gon' fall
I'm busy or booked
Whenever these girls call
Yeah, all the girls
They tryna ride with me

You can glide with me
I'm up in the clouds
So come and fly with me
We can go high
Fill the sky with me
Hit me 'cause I'm fly
