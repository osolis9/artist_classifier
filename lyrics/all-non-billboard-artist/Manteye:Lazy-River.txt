Lazy-River:Manteye
Well There Were Shady Trees Here Where I Was Born
The Rivers Still There But The Trees Are Gone
Like Everything Else I Guess Nothing Ever Stays The Same
And People Come Here From Miles Around
To Pitch There Tents Near The Midway Grounds
And Listen To Rock And Roll
In The Pouring Rain

And It Could Never Feel Like Some Foreign Land
So I'll Come Back Here When I Can

Because I'm Still Here Stuck On Lazy River Again
Oh Yes I'm Still Here Stuck On Lazy River Again

Now The Old Man That Used To Live Next To Me
Had A Faithful Dog And A Colour T.V.
That We Would Watch As He Spoke Of The Good Ol' Days
He Said I've Been Around This Big Old World
Still Stand At Attention When The Flags Unfurled
When I Was A Boy Son Things Had To Be That Way
And What Brought Me Back Here I Don't Know
I Guess There's No Place That I Can Go

Because I'm Still Here Stuck On Lazy River Again
Oh Yes I'm Still Here Stuck On Lazy River Again
You Bet I'm Still Here Stuck On Lazy River
Rock And Roll Is Still Here
Stuck On Lazy River
The Old Man Is Still Here
Stuck On Lazy River
And It's A Lonely Place Yea
