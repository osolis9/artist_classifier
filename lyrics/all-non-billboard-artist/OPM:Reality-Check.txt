Reality Check
Reality check from Southern California 

With brothas smokin' on there 
damn we rollin 
Hadnin' the mic 
till we decide about the safe life 

California where I raised till this very day 
hell to pay for the ways of the blaze 
Everyday, a hundred miles an hour 
?
Cause my soul's been devoured 
Never looked up above 
and push came to shove 
As it usually does 
keepin' with these thugs

Doin' all of these drugs with no means of direction
Infection
But here's my objection
Rejection
by your whole congregation 
With no empathy for my situation 
no place in society thats my reality
Angry dont know whos the enemy 
I'm in deep 
Underneath the streets 
it's hard to creep from city to city 
with all these hitters and the heat 
Killin' me, stealin from me 
Makes no sense to me 
So I keep it tight with the homies in the family 

Here's a reality check from the streets of California 
Keep your eyes wide open to what's really goin' on, yo 
Things ain't always what they seem 
Things ain't always what they seem

Here's a reality check from the streets of California 
Keep your eyes wide open to what's really goin' on, yo 
Things ain't always what they seem 
Things ain't always what they seem

We're all smokin 
Tryin' 
Broken homes 
Chokin' locos 
for pesos 
Slingin' dope by the case-os 
Smokin' cocos
laced with dope and opium
Cities for niggaz causin' fuckin' pandemonium 
?? cottonmouth ??

Bustin' tracks from Kid Kreation 
me and the artists who performed the hardest collaberations 
Born and raised in the golden state 
?
servin' up some dinner 
For southern county serial
imperial 
superial lyrical 
?? Opium den
Evolution of man
for your political polution 
There's no solution for these county criminal minds 
Just subliminal rhymes 
Hypnotizing mankind 

Here's a reality check from the streets of California 
Keep your eyes wide open to what's really goin' on yo 
Things ain't always what they seem 
Things ain't always what they seem

Heres a reality check from the streets of Califonia

See California the major growth industry 
are private security and penitentiary 
risin from the ?
Post-war economies
that's why the pigs got my homies down on their knees
Lined up against the walls 
so the community can see 
that the po po wont go away 
So please, now
Open up your eyes and realize 
The land of sunny skies 
disguised as paradise 
is a lie 

Here's a reality check from the streets of California 
Keep your eyes wide open to what's really goin' on yo 
Things ain't always what they seem 
Things ain't always what they seem

Here's a reality check from the streets of California 
Keep your eyes wide open to what's really goin' on yo 
Things ain't always what they seem 
Things ain't always what they seem
