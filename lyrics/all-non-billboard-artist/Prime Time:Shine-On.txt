Shine-On:Prime Time
Daybreak kicks me back in line
Can't shake the dreams, won't leave the lie
Don't want to lose the thrill

Choose if you want, this part of town
Is where the rich don't hang around
I want to get away: get me out

Time to love
Time to share
Time to hope

Lifting the stone right off my grave
I'm going back same time, same place
Ain't gonna lose the price

Back eye to eye, the moment's there
The choice to shoot is once to rare
This time I'll stand my ground
Count me out!!!

Time to love
Time to share
Time to hope

Time to feel
Time to care
Time to try the other way

Shine on me
Shine on me

Time to love
Time to share
Time to hope

Time to feel
Time to care
Time to try the other way

Shine on me
