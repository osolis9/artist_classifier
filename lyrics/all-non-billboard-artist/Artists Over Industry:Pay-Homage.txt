Pay-Homage:Artists Over Industry
Yo, Momma said knock you out and rock the bells
Puffin' chronic and growing up in juvenile hell
It's the science of a man, who can I trust
Visions of Gandhi, all we got is us
Forgive my sins, my backs up against a wall
I whirlwind through cities and learn to take a fall
Silent weapons used for quiet wars
Dressed to kill with a pair of liquid sores
I'll become a trust master half man half amazing
Back the fuck up it's the mad faced invasion
Build your skills learn the code of the streets
The streets are real, our reality is six feet deep
It's survival of the fittest from the cradle to the grave
The temperature's rising so I drink away the pain
The basic instructions before leaving earth?
I resurrected REAL hip hop with this verse

I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest
I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest

Yo, yo, all eyes on us - "The Lost Generation"
The world goes round, electric relaxation
Can it be that it was all so simple
Used to love rocking over that "Cream" instrumental
Another wasted night with nothin' to do
I thought the taste of life meant, I've nothin to prove
Got slapped by reality, confronted by truth
Realized I was the way I was because of my youth
And as for hip hop? I only fucked with a few
Old school shit like Gangstarr and Jay Ru
Organized, Confusion, Common, Afu
KRS, Artifacts, Roots, just to name a few
All had an influence on the emcee I became
Violent by design, it's just one of those days
My pops tried to explain pleasure and pain
I knew from this point forward I would never be the same

I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest
I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest

I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest
I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest

Yo, Between a rock and a hard place - I'm still at it
It was written from the wrong side of the track, I'm steelmatic
And I'm hopin' one day it'll all make sense
Can I borrow a dollar? Nope here's fifty cent
Everything remains raw, do it to death
WOOHAA! We got you all in check
I'm focused daily and I never lose touch
The choice is yours, its not right if its not rough (Bring the pain)
Bring the pain, I get my thing in action
Fear not of man, got the heart of an assassin
There's no escaping this, the revenge of the prophets
Stakes is high, things fall apart, you can't stop it
Truepocalypse now, and I'm ready to die
Trading war stories as I journey through the darkside
On a... world tour with a mic in my hand
Life goes on, ONLY god can judge this man

I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest
I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest

I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest
I wanna take this time out, to pay homage
To those who came before me, and I promise
To keep the nonsense, free from my concepts
And stay honest
