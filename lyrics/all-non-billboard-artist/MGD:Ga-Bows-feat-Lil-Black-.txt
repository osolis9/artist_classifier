Ga-Bows-feat-Lil-Black-:MGD
Now take a ride with me on the south side of Atlanta
Boy you hear them guns, now Godby Road is where they coming from
Unknown bustas is popping up on the scene
Now that's a hazard, cause we clear deep in the plaza
Newcomers wanna roll, you giving them 80 percent of your shit
Or get your motherfucking wig split
Them bustas who wanna roll through, hey they be the ones
That throwin the gat tat, or the click click
Or the rat tat or the tat tat
We be riding like that be twenty-one off the hook
Now boy you gone stuck
Cause these niggas on the street ain't scared, they gone buck
We don't give a fuck about you or your foe
Cause you on the wrong street, for that we cut throats
We the realities and nightmares that make y'all panic
And that big ass iceberg that sank the Titanic
So if you don't understand, then I suggest it to foes
Here come a bunch of motherfuckers throwing Georgia bows

Here come them dirty south cats throwing Georgia bows
With them ATL gangstas screaming Godby Road
Here come them dirty south cats throwing Georgia bows
With them ATL gangstas screaming Washington Road
Here come them dirty south cats throwing Georgia bows
With them ATL gangstas screaming Simpson Road
Here come them dirty south cats throwing Georgia bows
With them ATL gangstas screaning Cameron? Road

My gold in the fo-do be nigga SVO
That's them niggas on that Godby Road throwing Georgia bows
I flip the script, so many people, they getting kilt
Cops getting built, but shawty I'm gone slip
I hit the club, I'm at the bar, I spend a dub
Your girl leaving with me, so I ain't got no love for that bia
Who's? color, put her eye
She thought I was tricking, I stuffed a bow in her mouth

Black and skeetin money, green ride on seventeen
Every nigga we pass got they mug, look at me
But I just drive by, stay out the middle of the driveby
Everytime they see MGD, they say he just drive by
Here we go on a fifth again
Got your mind bent like on a fifth of gin
Feeling good, take it like a good girl for when
At the bar spend a grand sack of benjamins
I ain't dropping them, bust they funky clothes
Straight to the ground like funky toes
Stay away from all them fucking hoes
Get them off me with Georgia bows

We hitting the club tonight, y'all know how it goes
Wanna say I'm a thug nigga, throwing them Georgia bows
And it won't stop, no time for second guessing
Getting close to them broads that shaking them body dresses
What a find boy, be twenty-one off the hook
So split the L shawty, roll the green and let it cook
All my folks at the bar raise a glass
Take it to my head straight spinning from DJ thugs
But I'm still spitting game at the crows
Can't walk a straight line with a blindfold
And i'll bet you won't walk on them toes
G Road in the house and oh yeah I'm walkin with them
Them broads you with keep choosing so we gone get em
Put 'em on a plate like flake, ya damn right
We ain't using nothing but rubbers and an OJ knife
Now all my thugs keep bouncing and stay on the flo'
And I ain't got to say shit, y'all niggas know what to throw
