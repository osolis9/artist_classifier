Impressed:Bei Maejor
I'm tryn'a be for real alright*

I'm just so impressed wit' yo booty and yo breast
I'ma have to take you home tonight
Forget about your friends
Shorty jump up in this Benz
Baby we gon' get it on tonight

Yeah, unh
She got it poppin' (poppin')
Lip lip lip glossin' (glossin')
Runnin' the show
Lil' mama bossin'
Me-Me-Met her in Boston
Diamonds she flossin'
Ki-Ki-Killin' the scene
Clo-Clo-Closin' the coffin
Heard she moved to Miami
Now she cheer for the Dolphins
I know them niggas impressed
'Cause you don't see her kind often
She ain't one for the talkin'
She just wa-want them dollars
I pulled up that drop
And now her friends tryna holler
I told'um

I'm just so impressed wit' yo booty and yo breast
I'ma have to take you home tonight
Forget about your friends
Shorty jump up in this Benz
Baby we gon' get it on tonight

Love how she do it (do it)
Shorty get to it
I was up on the stage
She was feelin' my music
Rock my hat like I'm Jewish
Kick that b-tch to the back
I like my pics upside down
I like my chicks with them racks
I like to slow down the song
Right in the middle of that
I like to slow dance with girls
What you gon' wit' all that?
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm impressed wit' yo style
I'm impressed wit' yo figure
Knew you from back in the day
It look like you done got thicker
Man I thank God for that food
Ya ma-ma-mama was feedin' ya
It went straight to them hips
And a couple other regions
But I ain't trippin' at all
Like them love handles and all
3 1 3 2 4 2 triple 7 5 when you call
I'ma tell you

I'm just so impressed wit' yo booty and yo breast
I'ma have to take you home tonight
Forget about your friends
Shorty jump up in this Benz
Baby we gon' get it on tonight
