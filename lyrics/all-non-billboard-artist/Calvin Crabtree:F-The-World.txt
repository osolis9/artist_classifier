F-The-World:Calvin Crabtree
Lost mind broke heart am I a shell of a man?*
This was not my plan it was planned on me
Setup to fail but yet I rise above
He flame on a quest for the fortune and fame
No blame except for my self never realized it
Now I'm in the game trying to open people eyes
Not surprised they was hating they knew I'd make it
The lord set a path to release me please believe me
People they wanting to be or shit talking
Either way I'm part of the sean names
Calvin Crabtree but call me Freddy Kruger
Cause I'm the man of ya dreams not drifting
Always on point ready to ride just give me the signal
Taking them out even if they busting from every direction
Keep the heat on me ain't got to tell me I'm crazy
I realize it when I drink alone and think back
It gets me down dose it embed more rage
Shit I'm wild from society's standeards
Yet I look for and ask but they have no answers
I guess I just become a man huh

So who don't you just go ahead and drop it I'm like no other
When I come threw busting mide of a militant leader
Gifted to spit so I preach who else gonna reach
Rap come and go lessons stay learned
O I'm gonna stay down still balling still smiling
An simulate chilling or rolling
Can't' simulate it it's real still I'm in the flesh
Possessed guided by spirits or thought from the top
Of his head either way it's the best no contest
Catch Crabtree drinking that brew spitting that game
Stay doing his own thing commercial character buster
Is what half these fools is had to set it straight
In the beginning they said rap was a trend
Now the real MC lost I'm fin to follow
In they shadows so look for me I'm living the life
All the ladies tell me I sound so nice
On a come up can stop it you might heard this shit
And it sound familiar but it's something new
Busting threw all ya crew sounding lame
No true talent all punch lines and trying to diss
No one got it like this
You swift footed go ahead and tire out
I make the fire come out
