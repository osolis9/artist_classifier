The-Road-Killer:Sandman
Leather jacket on my shoulders speeding at the road
I will never stop and I never should
Cause I'm a deadly war machine my motors are running loud

Death is near, it's breathing on your back
Roads are flaming under my tires
The whole world behind me is turning black

I am The Road Killer
And I'm riding over the seven seas
I am The Road Killer
And I'm the worst there will ever be

I'm speeding like a highspeed train
driving through the limits of madness
Angels are falling into ocean, because I'm spreading the sadness
My journey is endless I will never sleep again
Raging thunder is on my side, can you feel the pain?

Live to die, you shall never come back, just cry
Run away I'll catch ya, and now you'll die

I am The Road Killer
And I'm riding over the seven seas
I am The Road Killer
And I'm the worst there will ever be

I am The Road Killer
And I'm riding over the seven seas
I am The Road Killer
And I'm the worst there will ever be

I am The Road Killer
And I'm riding over the seven seas
I am The Road Killer
And I'm the worst there will ever be
