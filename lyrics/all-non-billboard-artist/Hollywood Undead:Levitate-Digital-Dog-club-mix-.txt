[J-Dog]
Can´t stop I need some help.
Fuck you, I´m by myself
Is it a true or lie?
It´s what you can´t deny.
´Cause it´s the whay you think
Mix with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way you are
Flowed up to there, close to God
You know that hiding ain´t gonna keep you safe
Because the tears on your face
they leak and leave a trace
So just when you think the true love´s begun
It goes off at any second just like a loaded gun
[Chorus - Danny]
You know, I can take you straight to heaven if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate! You know
[J3T]
Can´t stop the feeling,
high as a celling
I got the money who´s fuckin´dealin´
I feel the heat like the barrel of a gun
I forgot the last time I saw the sun
I´ve got a disease
It´s digging deeper in me
It´s like my mind is leaving,
But my heart keeps beating
So I´ll paint the walls, drip from the nose
But where it goes, nobody really knows
Hit the bottle and she´s starting to follow
I fall asleep there ain´t no tomorrow
Guns are far, nobody can save me
Who needs you when I´ve got my baby
My baby is beautiful she loves me true
But if she dies i hope i die too!
[Chorus - Danny]
You know, I can take you straight to heaven if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate! You know
[Charlie Scene]
I put down another sack of them
then it´s straight back to the flask again
I can´t help stop what´s happening
One the wrong track, yeah, I´m back again
Up shit creek and I´m paddling
blacked out room and I´m travelin´
Good ideas I´m liking them
I´m too fucked up now I´m babbling
Wondering how to fix these damages
All these goddamn damages
Covering myself with bandages
From all these goddamn damages
Wondering how to fix all these damages
All these goddamn damages
Covering myself with bandages
From all these goddamn damages
[Chorus - Danny]
You know, I can take you straight to heaven if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate if you let me
You know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate
I can make your body levitate, le-levitate! You know
You know
