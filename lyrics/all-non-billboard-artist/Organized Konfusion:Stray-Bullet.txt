Stray-Bullet:Organized Konfusion
Let the trigger finger put the pressure to the mechanism
Which gives a response, for the automatic
Clip to release projectiles in single file
Forcing me to ignite then travel through the barrel

Headed for the light at the end of a tunnel
With no specific target in sight
Slow the flow like H2O water
Visualize, the scene of a homicide, a slaughter

No remorse for the course I take
When you pull it, the result's a stray bullet
Niggaz who knew hit the ground runnin' and stay down
Except for the kids who played on the playground

'Cause for some little girl, she'll never see more than six years of life
Trifling, when she fell from the seesaw
But umm wait, my course isn't over
Fled out of the other side of her head towards a red Range Rover

Then I ricochet fast past a brother's ass, oh damn
What that nigga say, "Aw fuck it", next target's Margaret's face
And I struck it, now it's a flood of blood in circumference to her face
And an abundance of brains all over the street

Shame, how we had to meet, dashin', buckin'
Greet by fuckin' family, they follow behind me in a orderly fashion
Bashin' through flesh, I'm wild crashin' through the doors
Of projects hallways to deflect off of the tile

I'm coming for you, little girl, once inside, I shatter your world
Swirl, no more dreams no hopes when I spray
You better pray, to the Pope or the Vatican
Before I go rat-tat-a-tat again

I'm mad again, brother, somebody's mother will be sad again
But, whose blue skies will turn gray
From the attack, of the Mac-11, I'm a stray bullet

Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Nobody seen shit, nobody heard it

Gun balls of fire, I'm traveling at higher speeds
To proceed to penetrate flesh, hitting the splint
After splitting the chest of a Queens fiend
Age of pagers shredded to pieces from the Glock 9

And it's hollow tips, it releases the polices in back of the ambulance
Blood loss as I shift across your chest
Arrest, rupture, I mess up ya, slasher
Shall I bust ya liver, faster, blood pours

Now it's up to the master, boom, as I crash open the doors
Thank me for spraying the operating room
The body still consumes me, doc had to remove me
Mmm Lord, why do they use me?

I'm takin' individual for keeps Hobbes
So peep the cops, in the ghetto bustin' shots for props
And when I hit, shit, soon you forgets-me-not
Cops tried to explain to his pops what I done

I flip up the hollow tipper and I'm not the one
And as a human I'm the surprising one
Prince Po, I flow the ripper, either way
You never, ever know how I'm coming

Metamorphasizing, rising in turbulence
Condensed into a bullet, pull it, now I'm making moves
With no sympathizing, uh, so take a hit nigga, sprint
Onto the scenario, I'm at a party with O

A lot of honies parlay and the DJ's playin' the Fudge Pudge flow
Five niggaz come up in the club for a rub
Yo, O peep it, oh shit, O duck
(Oh shit! Oh shit!)

Another hit, another struck, here comes Mr. Stray Bullet
Five, the tip, getting my jollies from the screams of the ripped
In your chest, then I flip, nip your liver, blood flowin' like a river
Money starts to shiver then I give a delivery of burns

Bruises fake shoes is your renaissance
No response your moms is out cold
Figure I'm bigger takin' your heart nigga at twenty years old
Stray bullet
