Braided-Hair-feat-Giant-Leap-and-Neneh-Cherry-:Speech
Yeah, we was talking earlier and I was telling you
Talking 'bout life, I feel like, life is like braided hair
'Cause it's sorta like twist you know
You know 'bout braided hair like twist
You know three strands twist together
Ultimately you get to where you wanna get to

From the same dirt from the heels of my ancestors
There's naked road and the fields where the pain festered
I wonder where the hold came from
In the deeps of my heart make me yearn for the drum

It's the same place where the cross is burned
The same place where the loss was earned
It's the place where the floss was yearned
Gold teeth and bling ice on the ring baby sure

We've all got things that are hanging about
Things that make us cool, things that make us whack
Things that make us mad, things we wish we never had done
But they're just the things that make us real
Not the maps to guide where we go from here
The road twists and braids our hair until we all get there

I like that I don't know some mysteries
Ancient things and beginnings
Excited about the day when I don't have to hear all the theories
My scalp needs some grease

It's the same place where the crosses burned
The same place where the loss was earned
The only way we all can learn
Is if we have these braids with the twist and turns so

We've all got things that are hanging about
Things that make us cool, things that make us whack
Things that make us mad, things we wish we never had done
But they're just the things that make us real
Not the maps to guide where we go from here
The road twists and braids our hair until we all get there

Walking in the race of life, looking for my own space
Not always wanting to but I have to
Sometimes feeling like I've bitten off much more than I could chew
But the wind goes though my hair lifts me up with ease not a crease
Hair full of grease no weave embracing me
It's you I see, I am you and you are me I see yeah

[Foreign content]
I am you and you are me I see, yeah

We might survive as brothers, yeah, or perish here as fools
Go place your bets don't bet too soon
Yeah, you might find me in another feels like someone you once knew
You know that face yeah we all do

We might survive as brothers, yeah, or perish here as fools
Go place your bets don't bet too soon
Yeah, you might find me in another feels like someone you once knew
You know that face yeah we all do

We might survive as brothers, yeah, or perish here as fools
Go place your bets don't bet too soon
Yeah, you might find me in another feels like someone you once knew
You know that face yeah we all do
