Wonder:Naughty Boy
feat. Emeli Sand√©


I can beat the night, I'm not afraid of thunder,
I am full of light, I am full of wonder.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I ain't falling under,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I am full of wonder.

Though I feed my deach
The World's upon our shoulders.
No way we gon' break, 'cause WE are full of wonder.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We ain't falling under,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We were full of wonder.

(X2)
This light, this light is contagious
Go, go tell your neighbours
Just REACH out, and pass it on uuh yeah yeah
This LIGHT is contagious,
Go, go tell your neighbours
Just REACH out and pass it on, uuh yeah yeah.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We ain't falling under,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We were full of wonder.

When everything feels wrong,
And darkness falls upon on you
Just try sing along, this is a message
From Copa Cabana.
If your heart turns blue, I want you to remember
This song is for you
And you are full of wonder.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We ain't falling under,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We were full of wonder.
