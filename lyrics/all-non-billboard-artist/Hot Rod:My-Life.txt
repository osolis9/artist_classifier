My-Life:Hot Rod
Yeah, yeah, this one right here
Yeah, yeah is for all the people loving life
We only got one life, one love
My life is what I'm living, fast cars, VIP
Good times, plenty women,
that's how life's supposed to be
Haters, gaggers close to me,
Excise me security, take them where they supposed to be
Hey oh, let's take a trip to Rome
And after we can go around the globe
Oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah
And we can get home, get some... and get blown
Stay high, stay fly, good times, this is my life!
Pre-I'm living free, can't hold me down
If I need champagne, it's popping now
Your life is so light in the tropic sea
If they're angels tell 'em it's
My life, my life, my life hey oh, hey oh
My life hey oh, hey oh!
Cause I love you, cause I love you
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh

These haters mad at us cause we're VIP status
.Bottles of Patron, now we're in the zone
Now everybody get your ass on the dancefloor
Hey oh, let's take a trip to Rome
And after we can go around the globe
Oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah
And we can get home, get some... and get blown
Stay high, stay fly, good times, this is my life!
Pre-I'm living free, can't hold me down
If I need champagne, it's popping now
Your life is so light in the tropic sea
If they're angels tell 'em it's
