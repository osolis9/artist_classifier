Do-It-Right:Cymphonique
Got that Audemar on my wrist
I got that card ready to swipe
I'm sayin you would probably trip
If you see what my backyard look like
See I'm sayin' If it exist
Then I done probably had it twice
You can ask anybody that know me
And they gon say I'm bout that life
See I promise you that this ain't nothing new
When I pull up in a whip they like ooo
Turn nothin to some change and a hater to a fan
I ain't frontin uh uh this just what I do
See I can't even lie my future looking so bright
All that hatin all that frontin that's that stuff I don't like
But If you ain't got no haters you doing something right
Said If you ain't got no haters you ain't doing something right
So when you do it do it right
Said If you ain't got no haters you ain't doing something right
So when you do it do it right
Said If you ain't got no haters you ain't doing something right

When we step out on the scene
It be all eyes on us
See the look on they faces
They ain't doing like us
Shout out to my haters, y'all my motivators
Yeah I may be young but I'm swimming in this paper
Ballin' like the lakers I can see trough all you fakers
You ain't keepin' 100 then you can't eat at this table

See I promise you that this ain't nothing new
When I pull up in the a whip they like ooo
Turn nothing to some change and a hater to a fan
I ain't frontin uh uh this just what I do
See I can't even lie my future looking so bright
All that hatin all that frontin that's that stuff I don't like
But If you ain't got no haters you doing something right
Said If you ain't got no haters you ain't doing something right
So when you do it do it right
Said If you ain't got no haters you ain't doing something right
So when you do it do it right
Said If you ain't got no haters you ain't doing something right
