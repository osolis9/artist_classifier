u cant see me
if it all ended tomarrow
(chorus)
what would u do if it all ended tomarrow
time runin out aint no more u can borrow
so paths wich one u gonna follow
what would u do if it all ended tomarow

what would u do if it all ended tomarrow
time runin out aint no more u can borrow
so paths wich one u gonna follow
what would u do what would u do 

uhh this is how it go down 
i had the black pound sound 
so it dont make sound
about a hundred fifty outta town
aint no buddy around 
im in the back seat breakin it down
my love has been a fast street dawg
latley i found hard breast
plz turn the radio down
but god bless 
now they talkin about layin me down
now they all about shuvles 
and the way to the ground
what now reachin all the way
to they head thing
waitin patiently 
to do the 6-foot same thing now
so i take a second look at my life
i made to many mistakes 
that i just couda made right
should of been more vocased
did i take things lite
when im gone 
this is what yall say i was like
and navrigent foul 
no not the badest or cruel
just a big fish
caught up in the shallowest pool
not a big name playa
that fact is true
never wouldve mist shit
without the catchy new
he got likey he got fame
in two weeks aint nobody
gonna remeber his name
fuck it im ready to go
i made recards made monitary
off with the flow
more inportantly though
i proved everyone wrong
its less of what u say when im gone
what would u do if it all ended tomarrow
time runin out aint no more u can borrow
so paths wich one u gonna follow
what would u do if it all ended tomarow

what would u do if it all ended tomarrow
time runin out aint no more u can borrow
so paths wich one u gonna follow
what would u do what would u do
i want yall to fell awarmess
the truth in my words
ive been quite for to long
the truth should be herd
it was a while back
10:20 in the morn
cat showed up on my lawn
in a rugged unifrom
unexpected theres a knock on my door
i met this fool in the club
ive seen him before
open to greet him
but the second he sees me
his eyes buckle
his voices are sleezy
but its cool
i aint even catchin at first
check his shoulder
homeies rockin a perse
now i notice summins tricky
but im all ready sittin down
homie pipes up 
u should hear what hes spittin now
says i been sleepin with his wifey
and he aint the kinda guy
to take that shit nicely
i made a move and he told me homie wait
reached in his perse pulled a crome38
he asked me if im ready to die
said he was gonna
blow mah brains all ova the sky
said he was leavin the country
headin straight with the passports
cocked the hammer
im thinkin my last thoughts
in a bad way
nuthin can save this
i close my eyes hopin its pain less
just watin for the sound
ready to swallow to
but homie havin trouble
with his follow thru
im american i avoid the char ground
homies confused
he just wanna be talked down
his wife been sleepin in town
and he knew it
pick me out of the crowd
but couldnt do it
he squashed it
as hes walkin away
i realized life is short
so im malkin at them
now its full speed ahead
and rest when im dead
and i could give a fuck
of what the next man said
i live how i wanna live
buy what i wanna buy
do what i wanna do
try what i wanna try
fear nuthin take chances
not afraid to fail
always makin advances
so when i ride on the grimreeper highway
no regrets bitch i did it my way
uhh yea uhh yea
what would u do if it all ended tomarrow
time runin out aint no more u can borrow
so paths wich one u gonna follow
what would u do if it all ended tomarow

what would u do if it all ended tomarrow
time runin out aint no more u can borrow
so paths wich one u gonna follow
what would u do what would u do
