Black-White:Sarai
Questions in mind will I be accepted or not
If not that's fine won't let it hold me down
The mold I'm breakin out stereotypes
Like she can't rip the mic she's white
Get it right come to a show
Come to a session at the studio watch me flow
Watch the record sales watch me blow
Watch me get em all sayin oohh look at her go
It ain't like that at first till I drop that first verse
Then cats eyes pop out like they brain gon burst
Get up in the club bout to rip a show up
They don't even know what im there for
Girls be like I can't believe she showed up
What's she doin here who let her in
Don't she see she don't belong yo she don't fit in
I don't fit in anywhere but everywhere at the same time
'cause all different types of people vibe off the same rhyme

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me whats visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lye beyond the phyical

People like you aren't supposed to do what you do
People like me what the f*** people like you
That prejudge and can't get beyond the color lines
Corrupt children and they children's minds spread through bloodlines
Hatred is not an instinct
Get some education for ya ass and then tell me what ya think
Learn from those I come in contact watch for attack
Keep my guard up down for combat
Can't back away 'cause they don't see it my way
Or they not used to people like me comin they way
Only hate 'cause people fear the unknown


But fear drive me to take a chance and be bold
Try to knock me down gotta stay on my toes
Prevail winner of the game 'cause they think I'm gon fold
More than you see more than skin and bones
More than blood more than flesh im soul

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me whats visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lye beyond the phyical

Yeah it gets rough being the minority's tough
Yeah there's been times I felt like I had enough
Bout to give up but I held strong
Felt like lettin' go of my dreams but I held on
I can't let anyone stand in my way
Everyone got they opinion I don't care what they say
Out of NY moved to the LI-TH-ONIA down to Ga
Me and my roommate stand out in the complex
Aint no thing I relate through rhyme contest
Earn my respect through rhymes
Rhymes help me get through times
When ignorant people creep under my skin and get to mines
I don't understand they mind state
Talk about both sides of the board dog they make me irate
Need to pick up a book and work they intellect
And let respect gain respect

Instead of black and white could it be me and you
Look inside my soul tell me whats visible
Don't put me with the rest I'm an individual
Sometimes the best things lye beyond the phyical
