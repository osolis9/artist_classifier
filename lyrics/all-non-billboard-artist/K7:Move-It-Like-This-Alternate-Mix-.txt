Baby that's a what I like
  (Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
  (Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like

In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets
And walked up to this girl

He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And her looks, that a night he liked to twirl
And he says

"I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oh, give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?
And we can move it like this"

Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like

And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long, long time ago
He fell in love but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife

And he sings to her nightly, he says
"Lydia, oh, Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya
Lydia, I miss your rose tattoo
There's some things I can't forget
Oh, honey, why did I dis ya? You can learn a lot from Lydia
I gotta move it like this"

Baby that's a what I like
  (Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
  (Hold me, squeeze me)
Baby that's a what I like

Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says, "How far do you want to go?"
He says, "How far is to Moreau?"
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard

Silence, then you hear
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, make sweet love to me
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, give me ecstasy
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, make sweet love to me
Give me all those things I miss
But start it off with a kiss
And move a little something like this

And now ya move it like this
  (Baby that's a what I like)
Start it off with a kiss
Then move a little something like this
  (Baby that's a what I like)

And now ya move it like this
  (Baby that's a what I like)
Start it off with a kiss, and now ya move it like
  (Baby that's a what I like)

Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
The moral of the story goes like this
Baby that's a what I like

Life brings you surprises
(Life brings you surprises)
Sometimes problems arise, yea
(Sometimes problems arise)
Life brings you surprises
(Life brings you surprises)

Sometimes you don't realize
Til it's right before your eyes and you say
I love to love you, baby
Can't live without ya, baby
Your life, it drives me crazy
If I only get one wish, number one on my list
To move a little something like this

Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Baby that's a what I like
Oh, baby that's a what I like
