Hands-Reach:Cadence
See it in the faces around you
See it in their empty eyes
Everybody's lookin for somethin
Like they've been left behind
But if we really love the broken
Then we would run to meet their need
Forget about our worries of comfort
And be a comfort to the weak

Chorus:
When hands reach and feet go
His light will break through the shadows
Repeat love so
We're like an echo
We're like an echo

It's not about us, you see
It's more than a spiritual feeling
It's a power we've been given
To echo what we've received
And so when our fire meets the city
And when our songs are more than singing
It'll be the greatest revival
This town has ever seen
We've ever seen

Chorus

Bridge:
Feel the weight of a thousand heartbreaks
See the need for a Savior's grace
Be the hands of a God who loves and saves
