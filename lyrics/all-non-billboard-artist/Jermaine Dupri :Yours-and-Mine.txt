Yours-and-Mine:Jermaine Dupri 
The world is yours and mine, break this up, none of that stuff
The world is yours and mine, yeah, work to hard, way to much
The world is yours and mine, whatever you want, can't stop us
The world is yours and mine, me and you, the world is yours and mine

I remember when we first hooked up we were only 17
Cut-off shirts and jeans was your only way seen
What I had didn't matter, it was all about us
All day on the phone and the stuff we discussed

I used to come over when your mom was gone
We didn't know what we were doing but we got our freak on
One thing led to another, I introduced you
To my mother like, "Ma, this my girl"
That was when it started getting real

Feeling kept getting caught, gifts
Started being bought and everybody knew the deal
We used to hang out, kiss, argue and all that
Hang up the phone and call right back

I got to know you like the back of my hand
And, you got to show me how a girl can love a man
And we took a small thing to a new land
And when I said I loved you I wanted you to understand it's real

The world is yours and mine, break this up, none of that stuff
The world is yours and mine, yeah, work to hard, way to much
The world is yours and mine, whatever you want, can't stop us
The world is yours and mine, me and you, the world is yours and mine

The only thing we got everyone said that you were going to change
But when 2-1 came, you were still in the game
'92s new version of Bonny and Clyde
No matter what it was we were side-by-side

You know the type you see getting it in a
Photo booth, matching shirts, flea market, photo shoots
Everything I saw cute, shit, you had to have it
What's the fly life if a nigga can't share it?

Every new dollar made I put it on you
Everything around your collar, braid, put it on you
At car dealership, shit, nigga bought two
And when I went away I got yo name tattoo

Hey yo, I'm trying to put the bling bling on yo hand
'Cause ah, you showed me how a girl can love a man
And, ah, we took a small thing to a new land and
When I said I loved you I wanted you to understand, it's real

The world is yours and mine, break this up, none of that stuff
The world is yours and mine, yeah, work to hard, way to much
The world is yours and mine, whatever you want, can't stop us
The world is yours and mine, me and you, the world is yours and mine

Yo, all of my nigga's that know what I'm saying
Look yo girl and in the eyes and say

Girl your so off the chain
You took the freighter straight out the game
Now I know what a good thing feels like
I know, I gotta have you in my life

Got me feeling messed up inside
You make a nigga just wanna do right
Me and you is like Dre and Snoop Dogg
As long as we together, we can have it all

Ha, you know what I'm talking about
When you love a man, sing to him, man
It ain't shit, man, know what I'm saying ball on
Now ride it out
