How-Do-I-Say:Usher
How do I say?
A foreign beauty so exotic
When she smiled at me
She took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a Goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say?

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful?
When I can't take my eyes off you
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you
My baby how do I say? How do I say?
How do I say?

The room was filled with a sweet aroma
When she danced her hips moved oh, so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so united
In the language that I never will forget

I hear her calling
Spinnin' around in the crowd 'cause she found me
And when she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that I want her, I want her
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
In my life, I've never felt like this
I've never had a lost for words
One kiss from her has got me feelin'

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful?
When I can't take my eyes off you
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer Bonita, how do I say? How do I say?

How do I say hello?
And I really wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful?
When I can't take my eyes off you
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you
How do I say? How do I say?

Baby lets engage in a deep conversation
In the body language we speak
Won't need any translation
I see a physical pleasure
As we explore
Together this universal language of love
My love, my love, my love
My love, my love, my love
Can you tell me how do I put it into words?

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful?
When I can't take my eyes off you
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer Bonita, how do I say? How do I say?

How do I say hello?

I wanna use the right words to impress you [Incomprehensible]
How do I say? How do I say?

How do I say hello?
I just wanna talk to you
Oh baby
How do I say you're beautiful?
When I can't take my eyes off you

I wanna use the right words to impress you
