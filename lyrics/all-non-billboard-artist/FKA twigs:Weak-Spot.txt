Weak-Spot:FKA twigs
[Intro]
I heard he's got a weak spot for you
He's gonna come
Gonna come running right
I heard he's got a weak spot for you
He's gonna come
Gonna run, coming right back

[Verse 1]
I saw you try to hide, to hide
He's gonna come running right back
I saw his inside through his eyes
The vision was circling black

[Hook 1]
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha

[Verse 2]
Know you wanna, gonna get him
Get him
I know you wanna, gonna get him
Slowly, you wanna pull him right
He's got you feelin' like you're found
Deep down
Rolling on your back, pussycat
He's mine, swine
I dare you, do me like that

[Hook 2]
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha
Ha-a, ha-a, ha-a, ha-a
Ha-a, ha-a, ha-a
Ha-a, ha-a, ha-a
Ha-a, ha-a

[Outro]
I heard he's got a weak spot for you
