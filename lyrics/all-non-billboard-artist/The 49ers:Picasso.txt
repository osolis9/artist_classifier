Picasso:The 49ers
Jas Mace

I'm an artist with the ink think of me as Picasso
Painting pictures with these words then I got to go
Because they probably won't respect it until I exit
It's a damn shame they don't see the writing on the wall while it existed
They missed it, critiqued it, wrote it off like it's toxic
But now they want to box it
And ship it out with great rates, and duplicate
Don't know if it's original or fake, so wake up
Because it's the real deal, surreal like
Salvador Dali my baby and escorted to the door
Elevator to the 4th floor
And welcome to my musical museum I'm your host for the evening
I'm Jas Mace I surfed the Great Wave
And hi-fived my fans because it's cooler in the shade
In this place we mixed rhymes with absinth
Until we're absent minded, blinded by the memories

It's a work of art, a masterpiece
Amazing with the techniques just to say the least
Great use of expression on a Hip-Hop beat
Could you sign your name on it just to make it complete
It's a work of art, a masterpiece
Amazing with the technique just to say the least
So remember me, and those that came before me
Don't wait until it's too late to recognize the great

Marchitect

Handle brushes with death like Edward Monk
Make them scream like the painting with the extra funk
That I masterpiece because yes I got the hot
Beats, and write words like I'm Basquiat
On my canvas it's analyzed on every single campus
I'm an artist, making pictures like Marcel Camus
But don't get it twisted, I'm quick to get brolic
And throw some shit together like the great Jackson Pollock
For more corners than a cubist
Connect the dots like impressionist, now I'm on some new shit
My new technique is vivid with new hues
But how I put it down left you thinking with no clues
How I blend up the palette you can tell I'm not new to rhymes
Why you going in circles like you're the Guggenheim
They unveil my works and start fainting
And now they hang around my crib like a painting

It's a work of art, a masterpiece
Amazing with the techniques just to say the least
Great use of expression on a Hip-Hop beat
Could you sign your name on it just to make it complete
It's a work of art, a masterpiece
Amazing with the technique just to say the least
So remember me, and those that came before me
Don't wait until it's too late to recognize the great
