Back-to-Basics-Radio-Edit-:Shapeshifters
Oh, so long together forgot how you made me feel
Tired of each other we drifted further afield
But there was nothing out there for me
I realized you're all I needed

Now that I got you caught, I don't know what I did before
You've made my life so special
Everything that I had before you give it to me with much more
That's why I can never let you go, no

Bring it back to basics, you and I-I-I will make it right
Let's get back to basics, bring it back, back to basics

I couldn't remember just what made me fall for you
Searching for others they make me feel all blue
But every time I felt that feeling
I knew it wasn't what I needed

First I nearly got you caught, I felt better than I felt before
You've made my life so special
Everything that I could want you, give it to me every part
That's why I'd never let you go, no

Bring it back to basics, you and I-I-I will make it right
Take it back, erase it, you and I will make it right
Bring it back to basics, you and I-I-I will make it right
Let's get back to basics, bring it back, back to basics

Oh yeah, you better bring it back, yeah
Bring it back to basics, you and I-I-I will make it right
Take it back, erase it, you and I will make it right
Bring it back to basics, you and I-I-I will make it right
Let's get back to basics, bring it back, back to basics
