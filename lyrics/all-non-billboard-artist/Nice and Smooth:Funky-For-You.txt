Funky-For-You:Nice and Smooth
Ladies and gentlemen, let's make it funky

Hey, yo, Dizzy Gillespie plays a sax
Me, myself, I love to max
Redbone booties, I'm out to wax
Stick up kids is out to tax

Spring again, and I'm feelin fine
Pass me an ice cold glass of wine
So I can get mellow, lay back
And let my girl play the cello
Hello, I hate Jello

Let me be me, relax in my tepi
Watch a Hardy Boy mystery
Greg, Nice, I'm Nitro
And I'm hype, so

Don't ever believe that you can deceive me
See many visions of love and splendor
I'm the real thing
Not like a pretender

I rock rhymes over beats on the real tip
Stay real strong and hang on like a vise grip
Use my mind to control all my body parts
Got an early start, plus I'm very smart

Type of man that the girls wanna read about
Indeed I proceed to rock the house without a doubt
Steppin up next, no further adieu
Smooth B is gonna make it real funky for you

I'm gonna make it real funky for you

Smooth B, notorious, glorious, knowledge is infinite
I live in a fortress, I'm so astronomical
Yet on a physical plane
My body's just a shell, in control is my brain

I strain to gain spirituality, so I can finally be in unity
Harmony with the all eye-seeing, supreme being
Knower of histories and mysteries, I'm mystic
Also stylistic not materialistic, simplistic
Humble while others tumble, stumble
Smooth B, not bumble, rumble

No, that's not likely, that's in my old school days like Spike Lee
Smooth B, my rhymes get better with time
I should get an endorsement for creating fresh lines
And as I grow older, lyrics get hyper

'Cause I'm a dominant black pied piper, spreadin' peace and love
Throughout my travels and take time to read and unravel
Day to day problems, and then solve
Them, I can see clearly now as I revolve

Around suckers who perpetrate heroes
But I'm no sandwich, more like a manwich
Or maybe like a meal, which is much more real
Than Clark Kent or the Man of Steel

Teddy Tedd, a Hip Hop ambassador, keepin you on the floor
Givin' you more and more, his cuts, exquisite
What is it?A blizzard
The musical wizard

You should come visit the man in the back
Without further adieu, Teddy Tedd is gonna
Make it real funky for you, I'm gonna
Make it real funky for you

Let's make it funky, Greg Nice, makes it funky
Smooth B, makes it funky, Teddy Tedd
Makes it funky, Special K, makes it funky
DJ Doc, makes it funky
And the Blend, made it funky
