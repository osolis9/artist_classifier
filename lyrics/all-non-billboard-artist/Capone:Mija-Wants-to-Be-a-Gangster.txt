I Met Her Late Back In 88 When Mija Didnt Bang She Had Her Hale
Straight I Know Her Pops Was A Police Maybe Thatz Why She Didnt
Hang Wit The Homiez Maybe A Couple Times Babygirl Kicked It
Gangster Life Style I Think She Digged It
Bunch Of Cholos And Back Yard Jutas
Gettin Down And Dirty Wit The Judas
Throwin Up Placasos On Enemies Street
Mija Pepped It All It Was Some Desest
Brain Washed The Girl Now She Dropped Out Of Class
Hangin Out In The Lane Where The World Moves Fast
Mija Gots A Gun But Don√¢t Know How To Shoot It
Til She Took Her First Cruise On A Drive By Shootin
5 Enemigos On The Corner Smokin She Send Them All To
Heaven No Jokin
