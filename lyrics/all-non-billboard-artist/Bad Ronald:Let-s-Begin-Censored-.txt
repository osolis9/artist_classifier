Let's Begin (Censored)
Thanks to Ffej for these lyrics.

(chorus)
We're gonna light the trees
Tap the keg
Shoot the sh
Now lets begin
We're gonna kick right back
We're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl 
You're gonna love this sound

I feel fine cuz I smoked a lot before
What you stoppin for, keep passin by
Smoke good trees, get a long lasting vibe
I know it might be right, I know it might be wrong
If I'm gonna have a drink it might as well be strong
It's not the beginning and it's not the end
We gonna pass it around, so we can hit it again
Look at me, I live life while I can
Don't get the wrong idea of what I actually am
Like a flash in the pan, so hold on tight
Got your little bud, and everything gone be alright

(Chorus x2)

Now once the beer starts flowin everything gone be fine
I be stuck up in the party, tryin to get mine
Left paw on wine, right margarita shakin
Tryin to concentrate but I'm straight space caking
Like the ???? forgettin what I know
My girl told me to wait, but I had to come and go
Go steady with the flow, palpitation precision
Put my feet to the track, to properly ride the rhythym
Takin and I'm giving, living for today
This karma gonna get you in the long run anyway
And in the short from the sport I was straight Charles Braunson
And you stood out, you was ... Larry's johnson

(Chorus x2)

Everybody's raising drinks to the sky
Mr. DJ, make yourself amplify
Lovely ladies, get up don't be shy
Listen up, as I clarify

Omission, to why I'm spittin
Cause y'all be whinin and bitchin
Holy rollin and dissin
There ain't no hate in my group
We just do what we do
We ain't stoppin we got plenty of trees and enough movie stars

Everybody's raising drinks to the sky
Mr. DJ, make yourself amplify
Lovely ladies, get up don't be shy
Open yours, don't be standin by

(chorus repeat till fade)
