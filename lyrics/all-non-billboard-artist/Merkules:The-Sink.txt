The-Sink:Merkules
Whenever I get stressed out, all I do is drink
Bottle after bottle got me leanin' by the sink
And I ain't about to slow down anytime soon
I drink away the pain, til' i haven't got a clue
Whenever I get stressed out, all I do is drink
Bottle after bottle got me leanin' by the sink
And I ain't about to slow down anytime soon
I drink away the pain, til' i haven't got a clue

First it started out with beer, I would drink it by the box, word
Sippin' on that liquor til' i'm pissin' in my boxers
Then i'd get that after morning anxiety
I'd drink more cause that Captain Morgan's still eye'n me
But that's the shit that I would drink when I was younger
A fuckin' outcast who never listened to his mother
It was a job try'na get me home for suppa'
I was busy stealin' shit to get a lil' drunker
Phones, wallets, whatever I would see at parties
I'd back in an hour screamin' out "Free Bacardi!"
Denis the Menace, the alcoholic version
Tell them chicks chill, I ain't bout' to rob your purses
Cause I changed, now I make enough to pay for that
Here's a free round on me, you get no chase with that
Tequila please no lime just a bit a salt
I'll be fightin' in an hour so don't get involved

Whenever I get stressed out, all I do is drink
Bottle after bottle got me leanin' by the sink
And I ain't about to slow down anytime soon
I drink away the pain, til' i haven't got a clue
Whenever I get stressed out, all I do is drink
Bottle after bottle got me leanin' by the sink
And I ain't about to slow down anytime soon
I drink away the pain, til' i haven't got a clue

You know that feeling that you get on every friday?
When you know you'll be drunk in a couple hours chuggin' Bombay
I love that
I live for moments like those
So i'm on stage drunk at my show with a go pro
The fat rapper with a punk rock mentality
You got a problem with it either fuck off or battle me
I'm pure white trash like truck stops and anarchy
Run you off the road firing gun shots at canopys
But thats only cause im blacked out wasted
Tomorrow I might wake up in a crack house basement
These cats styles basic, they mad outdated
I write a song record it then pass out naked
And when I wake up ill do it again
This booze is my friend
I'm bumpin gin and juice in a Benz
Til I swerve and I crash and I hit a pole
Thank god i'm only two blocks away from the liquor store, word
Whenever I get stressed out, all I do is drink
Bottle after bottle got me leanin' by the sink
And I ain't about to slow down anytime soon
I drink away the pain, til' i haven't got a clue
Whenever I get stressed out, all I do is drink
Bottle after bottle got me leanin' by the sink
And I ain't about to slow down anytime soon
I drink away the pain, til' i haven't got a clue
