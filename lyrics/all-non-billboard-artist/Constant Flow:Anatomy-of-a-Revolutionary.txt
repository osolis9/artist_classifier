Anatomy-of-a-Revolutionary:Constant Flow
Who would have thought back then I'd be blacking, face on the evening news
Not cause no crime but because my kind and enjoying my time at a BBQ
With my loved ones, my cousins, no thuggin', bumping a little bit of R&B;
Some Marvin Gaye, a little bit of Sade but the Jakes they want to fuck with me
So the block is popping and Papi pumping his Spanish music
Only black dude in the hood and I'm pushing my Panther movement
Everybody dancing, grooving, no problems happy moods and
No nasty attitudes and just an average family reunion
Well, out of no where come this pig from hell Jezebel she's a dominatrix
With her cuffs and stick and gun and clip for any confrontation
Type of chick that will blast first, won't have words no conversation
Stormed in with no warrant for my stereo to confiscate it
Fuck that, first they take your drums then they take your freedom
But not in here this Congo Square and every we slave we freed them
She asked for my I'd I said nah B where the fuck your papers at
I said this is my backyard, she said, "Act hard, and I'm gonna make you pay for that"

The blood of Jesus Christ, the head of William Wallace
The heart of Che Guevera, the hands of Victor Jara
The eyes of Martin Luther, visions of Pat Lamumba
The legs of Jessie Owens we marching to the future
March with me march with me
Who cares if they're shooting?
March with me march with me
We got to keep on moving
March with me march with me
And soon you'll see
The evolution of a revolutionary

To the pigs, I'm the felon and the bitch started yelling and she called my mama a fat fuck
In front of my kids, ain't no telling when I kicked this rebellion off, we gonna act up
Better call your back up it's bad luck on my property
You're out of bounds, this is hollowed ground so why you got to fuck with me
So they slapped my mama, grab my father and hit my little sister
Put her on the ground, ripped off her gown, and then they pistol whipped her
This altercation led to an escalation
So I went in my basement came back with guns blazing
Like bo bo bo bo, 50 shots from Sean Bell down to the Po Po
Bo bo bo bo, 41 shots from Dialo's Glock killer -- oh no
Loco Larry Davis, got the whole place barricaded
On the rooftop bout to make my thing sing serenade them while I pop me a Perry Mason
And my wife look hot got a good shot; Sarah Palin, won't go down for interrogation
We was trying to very patient, now we got more variation

We Waco, Texas, the state against us, to politicians we obscene
We in Masada, intifada come and bring in your S.W.A.T team
We're God's dream, nah mean some may say it's prophecy
Like Nehemiah we're freedom fighters, so now we're going to fuck with you
Like Attica, automatic guns and ready for the massacre
No incendiary cause the military might bomb our house just like John Africa's
So tell the news it's gone down, zealous dudes like John Brown
Rebel Army headquarters, Fela Kuti's compound
Special Ops trying to get in my home
On the roof top with their predator drones
But a force field is protecting my zone
So we ain't never gonna their federal loans
You got the Army, Navy, Marines on my cellular phone
We got Arawak African ancestors, we're never alone
We got Oscar Grant, Trayvon, Fred Hampton; every dude you slained
Warrior spirits and the bullets can pierce them in front of my house like a human chain
With shells repelling, Hell's rebellion, we don't need to escape
God's protection spreading all over my section, fuck your police state
