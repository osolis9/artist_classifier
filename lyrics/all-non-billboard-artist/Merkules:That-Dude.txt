That-Dude:Merkules
Stop sweatin' me ya'll know I got the recipe cohesive's on the left of me ready to let it squeeze
Fuck my enemies ain't nobody ahead of me but I'll be with that shit I'll get hit till it's hard to breathe
I'm a menace to society now high in the clouds droppin' brown and I'm mining them down
They on the left of me the right of me they even in front
I'll breathe in its blood I'm even eatin' people for lunch
Full of sleep at the wheel easy after eatin' these drugs
Put the keys in the truck and ghost ride with peeps in the trunk
They stick around an the police show up to clean up the blood
And when they do I just start screaming "well I feed em' with slugs"
My advocates as a parent, parents don't like murk
They know if the daughter hears them they scared that she might twerk
My shit's so fucking cold that I'm carrying ice burgs
And your fairys is like words so just spare me some nice words
Fuck ya'll I'm having fun right now
I'm kinda mad I'm number one right now
I see they're scared of me well I'd be too
They cryin' cause it's obvious that I'm that dude
Fuck ya'll I'm having fun right now
I'm kinda mad I'm number one right now
I see they're scared of me well I'd be too
They cryin' cause it's obvious that I'm that dude
I'm that dude with the tattoes and army scars
Party hard like it's Marty Gross screamin' "hardy har"
I get wasted let's just say I got a beach body
The same diet plan as Iron Man I eat broccoli
Who am I kidding man I dip it in gravy
Sippin' liquor, kissin' bitches in a vintage mercedez
I'm JZ difference is my shit isn't mainstream and I won't colab with Iggy even if Iggy paid me
I keep it underground when I thunderpound and break your skull
I'll punch you dead in the face homey so make the call
You rappers actin' like faggots you tryin' to place the call
I'm rollin' right up in the back and then I take it all
All got is rap and I'm sick of takin' the bottles back
I ain't flossin' stacks I'm working while they all pop their tags
I'd rather rap about my feelings than a product bag
A solid dragon, insomniac but I-I'll for pass
Fuck ya'll I'm having fun right now
I'm kinda mad I'm number one right now
I see they're scared of me well I'd be too
They cryin' cause it's obvious that I'm that dude
Fuck ya'll I'm having fun right now
I'm kinda mad I'm number one right now
I see they're scared of me well I'd be too
They cryin' cause it's obvious that I'm that dude
