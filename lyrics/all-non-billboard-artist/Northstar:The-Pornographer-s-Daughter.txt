The-Pornographer-s-Daughter:Northstar
I can't leave with words like these 
They break the bones that hold up my sleeves 
I've got to tie her so high her breath freezes 
before she speaks, but this bus just won't go far enough 
So I'll strap my face to a homemade bomb and blow the bus stop through the parking lot 
We'll celebrate like we were free 

I know a place where we can both get laced 
Take some time to learn about your face 
about bawling and bell curves 
about strength from inhalers 
and I'll take the fifth and you can just sit 
and I'll watch from a distance while you open it 
This is how I will keep her.in pieces.she's a keeper 

And I'll be holding my breath with the best. 
my breath with the best intentions 

This is not for me, your perfume struggles perfectly 
it wraps around and screams at me, 
"My hero tastes like plastic, he's elastic and now he's dead" [x2] 

My straight faced grin is the first to leave hand in hand with the queen of tragedy 
Why do I hurt just on purpose? 
I guess I lack a purpose. 
So smile like a child sitting in the sea forget about what's in the water 
and just focus in on me I'll be the phantom of the opera 
I'll be the lantern you blow out first. 

And I'll be holding my breath with the best. 
my breath with the best intentions 

This is not for me, your perfume struggles perfectly 
it wraps around and screams at me, 
"My hero tastes like plastic, he's elastic and now he's dead" [x2] 

And I'll be the reason you'll leave this city.(This is not for me)
