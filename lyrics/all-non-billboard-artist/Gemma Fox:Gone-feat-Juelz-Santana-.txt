(Gemma)
Boy, get up out my face, tellin me what to wear, betta go, yes or no, we ain't even gotta go there. Your houndin me, bare

(Chorus)
So u think u got control of me, owning me, without u even knowin me, but i, dnt like da things u showin me, so its time u

(Gemma)
How you tellin me, who you think my friends can be, turn against my family, you wanna keep me to yourself, you mad as
shit, think i'ma put up with this, i'm the kind to love and kiss, your the kind to hit and miss, you think your, a wise
guy, but wise guys, get the bye bye, i see you cryin, dont like da line, ain't no love loss, u betta back off...

(Chorus)

(Juelz)
All you do is listen to ur girlfriends, lil do you kno, all her info, she gettin from a girlfriend, i used to think you
got your ways from your mama, but now i'm startin to see, you get it from your girlfriends, it's like our life is their
entertainment, and you entertainin, like i entertain them, now you wanna put me in a container, dump me like a dumpster,
give me the retainer, say i'm gettin on your damn nerves, now you know how i felt, when you were askin for money to get
your hair permed, but i ain't here to stold da matter, i'm here to be a bigger man and mould da matter, give me your heart
let me mould it back up, dats da least i can do for a thing fourth due!

(chorus - repeat to fade)
