Treat-Ya-Self:Lil Yachty
(Verse 1 – Lil Yachty)
It took way too long to stack it up
But it’s way too quick to spend it, I dropped all my revenges
Give a f**k about these bi**hes, I’m thinking bout the riches
I got mind on the gold, I’m searching for my soul
Goddamn I’m so religious, these ni**as so fictitious
Never switched up on my gang, I had to stay the same
All you ni**as pu**y, all you ni**as ain’t real
What’s the deal? Tryna see how I feel
F**k around, get your block knocked off though
I need my fetti, I need it ASAP like Flacko
F**king her friend and f**king her then switcharoo
Ni**as be hiding like peekaboo
When you get on ni**as act like they been with you
Ni**as breath shorter than interludes
Pull up that Chevy, that shit sit on 22’s
My new bi**h bad, she like Jimmy Choo’s
Can’t love no bi**h, no Lil Boat cannot have a boo
I f**ked that bi**h then I pass her

(Chorus – Key! & Lil Yachty)
Yeah
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Yeah
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Treat yourself, don’t cheat yourself
Don’t you dare mistreat yourself
Don’t cheat yourself, go get that wealth
Go get it, go get it
Don’t you mistreat yourself
Don’t cheat yourself, go get that wealth
Go get it, go get it

(Verse 2 – Key!)
Treat yourself to the finer life
Black girl, white girl, klondike
Left hand, right hand, full of ice
Buy you bi**hes what you like
AK with the knife for you snitches
Man I hope you die
I just want to treat my mama nem to that finer life
I f**ked her….designer my pills
Money on my will, new for my
What have you done for me lately?
I swear these bi**hes is crazy
Wanting me go out my way
Bi**h I just want me some face

(Repeat Chorus)
