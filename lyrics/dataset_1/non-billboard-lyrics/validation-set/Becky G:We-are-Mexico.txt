We-are-Mexico:Becky G
Hard Work
Double time, over time, two jobs
Working till our hands hurt
But we are never let to pay the bills.
Mother
Said always follow your heart
make sure to keep your heart above the water
And I promise that I always will.
I see fifty latinos
Fifty Latinas
That's my crib on a weekend
That's my familia
Talking in Spanglish
En español.
I'm just here to let you know.
If you don't know, now you know
We Are Mexico.
And don't matter where we go.
Viva méxico.
