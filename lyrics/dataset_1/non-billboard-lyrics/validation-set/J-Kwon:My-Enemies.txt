My-Enemies:J-Kwon
They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Ridin' thinkin' I don't know
They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors

I wake up knowin' I'm bout to see 'em all in my face
Like wat up? These muthafuckers all over the place
I'm fed up homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck with all that thinkin' you gonna take my place

So a lotta niggas in this club popin' bub that's phony
Actin' like they got nothin' but love for the homie
Straight two face, they like them niggas at Sony
Now ain't you the mayor? I'm the one and only

For the longest me and my niggas been hittin'
This town like a storm
And now you gotta see me and penny arm to arm
One day you don't get it, keep tryin' nigga
Ya right you ballin', keep lyin' nigga

I know a llot a ballers, half of 'em hatin' me
Bankrupt bitch you must ain't see my moms lately
Be damned if you like me, give a fuck what you rate me
I only know two words the nigga thats payin' me

Now we fin stop talkin' shit about J.D
'Cuz he been doin' this shit since yall was babies
How you goin' try to degrade me?
Yall ain't my friends think I ain't crazy

My enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Ridin' thinkin' I don't know
They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors

They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Ridin' thinkin' I don't know
They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors

I wake up knowin' I'm 'bout to see'em all in my face
Like wat up? These muthafuckers all over the place
I'm fed up homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck with all that thinkin' you gonna take my place

Now I'ma chicka chill till the moment I lose mine
And when I lose mine gun stores gonna lose nines
I thought you knew Kwon keep eight on the waist line
I'm from the Lou, Kwon flip ace to waste time
I spit it for nigga so you don't feel my shit

She a whore I don't like her you can kill my bitch
You wanna war what for I peel this bitch
Body lifted, nothin' with it I don't need this shit
You my enemy dressed in my friends clothes
But when there's a shoot out
You do better than Shaq do with free throws

A bunch of niggas trippin' they got the game wrong
A bunch of niggas feelin' like me who bumpin' the same song
I'm evil, why you thinkin' you gonna take my spot?
Waitin' till my album drop, quit thinkin' you Pac
And you rappin' hardcore and you knowin' you pop
And you sayin' you a realer when you knowin' you not

They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Ridin' thinkin' I don't know
They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors

They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Ridin' thinkin' I don't know
They my enemies dressed in my friends clothes
Smile in my face but pop shit behind doors

I wake up knowin' I'm bout to see 'em all in my face
Like wat up? These muthafuckers all over the place
I'm fed up homie I'm angry and I need me my space
And good luck with all that thinkin' you gonna take my place
They my enemies
