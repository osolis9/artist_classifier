Only lust can save you
from your madness.
You want to take control of the urge
that is burning.
Only love can fill the emptiness of your soul.
You want to replace the sadness that is growing.
Master of this world
you are providing the essence of your wisdom.
Master of this night
you are offering your legion of followers.
Megalomaniac,
you shall be the king.
