Used-to-Be-the-One:David Guetta
[Featuring: Chris Willis & Mone]

(I'm ready, but it, but it, feels that's harder, harder)

He used to be the one that bring you pleasure
He used to be the one that pulled you through
Now his moods are changing like the weather
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
He's taking his frustration out on you
(used to be the one, used to be the one)

Leave him alone, let him go!
Baby it's your right, take back your life
Don't wait, for some other day
Tomorrow might be too late
Only you can stop the pain

He used to be the one that made you happy
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
He used to be the one to plead for you
(used to be the one) baby (used to be the one)
Now he's just a beast that keeps you crying
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
A demon from your worst nightmare come true

Leave him alone, let him go!
Baby it's your right, take back your life
Don't wait, for some other day
Tomorrow might be too late
Only you can stop the pain

Let him go
Baby it's your right, take back your life
Don't wait, for some other day
Tomorrow might be too late
Only you can stop the pain, yeah

Keeping you crying
But no where to run now
But the love isn't dying

(I'm ready, but it, but it, feels that's harder, harder)

He used to be the one that bring ya pleasure
He used to be the one that pulled you through
Now his moods are changing like the weather
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
He's taking his frustration out on you
(used to be the one, used to be the one)

Leave him alone, let him go!
Baby it's your right, take back your life
Don't wait, for some other day
Tomorrow might be too late
Only you can stop the pain

Let him go
Baby it's your right, take back your life
Don't wait, for some other day
Tomorrow might be too late
Only you can stop the pain, yeah

Those days are over now!
That he used to be the one
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
Those days are over now!
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
That he used to be the one......
