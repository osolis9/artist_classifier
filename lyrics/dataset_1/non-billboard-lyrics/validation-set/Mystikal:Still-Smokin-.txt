Still-Smokin-:Mystikal
Still smokin' bud, still smokin' weed king edward, philly blunt, swisha
Keep groovin', tampa sweet, good ol optimo, easy water, joker

My lips get black and my fingertips burn and my eyes half way open
Cough, cough and I'm chokin' but bitch I'm still smokin'
I wanna be puffin' this like I ain't be worryin' 'bout nothin'
If you gonna get the cigar nigga I'll do the stuffin'

I roll 'em swoll like broken arms
But I sure hate when they come around this bitch I don't know talkin' 'bout
Whatcha all smokin' on 'cause niggas like that we call 'em Hoovers
They try to get cool with ya to smoke your weed up

Is what they do ya puff, puff, puff, puff goddammit
Nigga you ain't chip in no shit here bitch what's happenin'
But if you did then it's good and it goin' down
Get rid of them nickels and them dimes

Bitch we throwin' pounds 10th thru 11th to the 12th ward bound
But P said one of my niggas I heard somebody say
One time but I paid it no mind and I kept rollin'
But that was the Po Pos

I gotta get rid of this fat ass optimo that I'm holdin'
Excellerate and I made that left on line center
I hit that bitch one more time
Then threw it out the window

Young niggas in a big white truck
You know what's up they're lookin' to catch you fuckin' up
It just so happened that I was hot they looked in the back on the floor
And the silver canon and they found the pot

I can't believe that I got popped
It took me 2 hours and 1500 dollars
To get unlocked straight from jail to the weed spot
Shit I took that as a minor setback hell no I ain't stop
And I'm still smokin' bud, still smokin' weed
