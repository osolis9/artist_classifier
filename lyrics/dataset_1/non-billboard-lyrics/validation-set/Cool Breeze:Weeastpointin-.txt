Weeastpointin-:Cool Breeze
Just got paid and I'm feeling right
'Bout X'd out on a Friday night
My girl paging me but she'll gone be all right
'Cause I'm falling through later on tonight

Now looka here, before we go
We gotta stop by seafood galore
Two piece whiting and a shrimp to go
A large lemonade, now I'm out the door

Bob's car wash keep my white walls tight
Just put down on the Holyfield fight
Ride by the hill holla at E. Neil
East Point raise ya flag been hill, been real

Tell me where you from

Tell me where you from

Tell me where you from, baby
(East Point)
Tell me where you from
(East Point)
Tell me where you from, baby
(East Point)
Tell me where you from

Flying like a bird all through the night
Ain't gone stop till the morning light
Suckers looking crazy 'cause they want my ride
But lil' do they know that I pack my side

'Cause my '98 oldsmobile
With bullets chrome the real real
So split that peel and bump that joint
Forever hollerin' East Point

I said, "My '98 oldsmobile
With bullets chrome the real real
So split that peel and bump that joint
Forever hollerin' East Point, Ungh"

My name cool breeze and I can't lie
I'm still teacher's pet at Cutta high
And I'm real laid back and like one of a kind
And if I leave East Point it'll be to find

Rico used to tell me when I turned nineteen
That I'mma be big in the south like buffalo wings
And I been blowing up the spot since the single came out
And I'm starting to make a lil' money it's getting hard to count

And if I carry any with me it's in a small amount
And I keep the rest in a stash by my auntie house
So check the Internet for when I hit your local stages
Of the the dirty south pages under south coast phrases
