The-Fire:Bishop Briggs
Gave me love, sweet love
Gave me love, sweet love
Heaven above, sent me love
But it wasn't enough, no it wasn't enough

'Cause I've been a devil, I've been a saint
Somebody help me, I can't change

I keep on (runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)
I keep on (runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)

Oh, I let my lover go, didn't wanna be a liar
Ashes in the cold, now I'm running toward the fire
(Runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)
I keep on (runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)

Gave me love, gave me sick sick love
But it was me who got swallowed up
Not enough, dust to dust, pray for us

'Cause I've been a devil, I've been a saint
Somebody help me, I can't change

I keep on (runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)
I keep on (runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)

Oh, I let my lover go, didn't wanna be a liar
Ashes in the cold, now I'm running toward the fire
(Runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)
I keep on (runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire)

Oh oh, gonna get burned, gonna get burned
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh, gonna get burned, gonna get burned
Oh

Oh, I let my lover go, didn't wanna be a liar
Ashes in the cold, now I'm running toward the fire
Runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire
Oh, I'm running
Runnin' toward, runnin' toward the fire, oh
