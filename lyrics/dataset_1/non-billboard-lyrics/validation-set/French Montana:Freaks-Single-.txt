Lights up the fire 
You know we get higher 
Rollin’ up loud real niggas move quiet 
Like it then I buy it 
You donkeys on a diet 
Bring all my jewels you know I start a riot 
Ridin’ with the bliquor 
Messin’ up her make up 
You blowin’ up her phone 
She aint trying to pick up 
Drinkin out the bottle 
I’m leanin’ with a model 
I throw a hundred racks up 
You think I hit the lotto 
Ridin’ with the wolves I aint talkin Minnesota 
Shorty coming over 
Gon’ bend it over

Put a drink on it

Look at his friend who be grippin the toaster

Put my legs behind my head hit the ceiling with it 
When I put it in his mouth I couldn’t believe it 
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it
