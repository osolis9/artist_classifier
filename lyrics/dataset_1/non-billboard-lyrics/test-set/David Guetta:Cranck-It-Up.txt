Cranck-It-Up:David Guetta
Keys to my, to my, to my
Keys to my star

She's the keys to my starter in my automatic car
Yeah, she make me wanna go harder and she always lift the bar
Well, she keep that spotlight glowing 'cause she is a superstar
Everybody notices girl when she step up in the place
Whether near or far

She might not be the one you see in a magazine
She might not be the one you fantasize in your dream
She's the only girl left in the world that can guarantee
What you need tonight

With my G's and we riding in a magnificent car
And we rolling with the baddest chicks and you won't see a flaw
Booty riding up so perfect, badder than my Audemar
When I pound it up so perfect, hit her, get her till tommor'

Watch her crank it up
