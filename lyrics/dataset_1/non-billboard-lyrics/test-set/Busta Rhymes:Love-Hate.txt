Love-Hate:Busta Rhymes
I think I love ya
I think I love ya not
I think I love ya
I think I love ya not (I love ya)
I think I love ya
I can't enough of your taste, baby come up
So pop, so up
Fuck it, I hate you
Baby â€˜bout to come up uh
Baby girl say you the one right
And I love the way you appreciate my some light
Revolve around me, how the planets do to sun like
You compliment the god, phenomenally dress right
In the beginning you was just a cutie
But I love the way you're fresh of spirit, man, how fresh your beauty
Smile, pretty ass bigger than my whole Jacuzzi
This my city have a seat and let me show the movie
But I don't like it when you tryna fight
Going through the love in hell for shit to turn right
Instead of turning left, that's when the pain stick
See I don't like it when your hands tryna talk shit
Just what the shit's your problem
When you be actin' moody?
Getting mad at shittin' cold out on the coochie
Even when I see the wrong sign
Baby girl, me love you long time
Baby I don't like you
(I've got a problem, baby)
Even though I love you
(You got me going crazy)
Baby I don't like you
(All up in my face, baby)
Even though I love you
(I can't get away from that taste, baby come up
So hot, so warm, without you, I hate you
Needless by the care of you)
Every time we step up on the scene
I love the way you shine, I love the way glean
I love the way you think, I love the way you dream
I love the way you cook, I love the way you clean
The way you rap for me, it's hard to doubt ya
I scratch my head thinking oh what it's I love about ya
So many different things, at the top you drive me crazy
But what I love the most is how you love my baby
But then again when you be actin' psycho
I don't like when you get jealous of me, actin' spiteful
I want you rollin' over, Seller's got me feelin' stylefull
See I don't like the way you black when you be on your cycle
I think I'm â€˜bout when you be slackin' up
And you could be see I don't like when you be actin' up
Even when I see the wrong sign
Fuck it, you know me love you long time
Baby I don't like you
(I've got a problem, baby)
Even though I love you
(You got me going crazy)
Baby I don't like you
(All up in my face, baby)
Even though I love you
(I can't get away from that taste, baby come up
So hot, so warm, without you, I hate you
Needless by the care of you)
That's why I got you on my side (I hate you)
That's when I put you on my ride (I love you)
It's why I rep you with the full mess (you know that I hate you)
Whenever you'll be on that bullshit
All my ladies all around the world
Hold your man down, show him how you rap to the finish
All my homies all around the world
Hold your girl down, show her how you rap when they with us
Baby I don't like you
(I've got a problem, baby)
Even though I love you
(You got me going crazy)
Baby I don't like you
(All up in my face, baby)
Even though I love you
(I can't get away from that taste, baby come up
So hot, so warm, without you, I hate you
Needless by the care of you)
Baby I don't like you
(I've got a problem, baby)
Even though I love you
(You got me going crazy)
Baby I don't like you
(All up in my face, baby)
Even though I love you
(I can't get away from that taste, baby come up
So hot, so warm, without you, I hate you
Needless by the care of you)
I think I love ya (I love ya)
(I can't get away from that taste, baby come up
So hot, so warm, without you, I hate you
Needless by the care of you)
I think I love ya (I love ya)
I think I love ya not
I think I love ya
I love you
