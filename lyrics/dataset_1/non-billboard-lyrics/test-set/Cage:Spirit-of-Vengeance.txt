Spirit-of-Vengeance:Cage
I sold my soul to the Devil
I sacrificed myself for one I had to save
Now I roam the road
Dressed in black leather
A flaming skeleton
That's wrapped with spikes and chains
I live my life alone
No turning back
Ill turn your soul to stone
My reasons are my own
So stare deep in my eyes
The evil inside you
Will eat you alive
Wheels burning the night
The spirit of vengeance
Will be by your side

Satanic speed avenging angel
Many mortal fool
Have challenged me and failed
Upon my steed I search for danger
The flesh of enemies
Beneath my wheels impaled

Ghost rider
Speeding, leaving
A terrible trail of fire
In the presence of evil
I change and I leave
All the wicked people to die
Blazing, razing
Hell hath no fury like mine
Like festering maggots
Feeding on flesh
On the souls of sinners I dine
My victims scream
The pay their penance
My brutal means are just my dark way to an end
their twisted dreams
No longer menace
I am a nightmare
All the righteous I defend
