Oh-How-We-Love-You:Profitt
Father, You love us without measure
Savior, You lead us to life
Spirit, You teach us to listen,
To laugh, to love, to cry
And we feel this ache inside

Jesus, oh how we love You
Jesus, oh how we love You
There's no other we desire
There's no other we desire

Thousands of songs have been sung
Stories of loss and of love
We can't deny this aching desire to respond
To laugh, to love, to cry
And we feel this ache inside

Jesus, oh how we love You
Jesus, oh how we love You
There's no other we desire
There's no other we desire

Jesus, oh how we love You
Jesus, oh how we love You
There's no other we desire
There's no other we desire

Abba, oh how we love You
You're our hope and
You're our refuge
