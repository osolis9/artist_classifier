Come-Come:Dem Franchize Boyz
Shawty, give it all to me
Shawty, give it all to me

Come, come over here so I can break you off a lil' some
Put you in positions you ain't neva thought of
In between the sheets we can grind and bump
Make the bed thump until you

Come, come over here so I can break you off a lil' some
Put you in positions you ain't neva thought of
In between the sheets we can grind and bump
Make the bed thump until you come, come

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
Then I spoke through my phone to see what bitch I'mma call
I can do the hypnotist, two of my pink toed bras
I can settle for a bank teller at Green Gramma's

But I'd rather be on put a bitch into action
Can't be a bitch man, but I stroke with that passion
I'm 'bout satisfaction, hope on my flight reader
Hope her cat leave her surface wet just like Katrina

Promise baby, I'll please ya, bet ya I can make your heart jump
Treat your body like the block R. Kelly when I 'Grind 'n' Bump'
Shit that's only if you come come
Like the hyphy movement, I have you goin' dumb dumb

Me and my boo man, our love it's like chemistry
A bad bitch don't give a fuck I'm in the industry
We watch the moon shine, we talkin' diamond colors
Kiss her neck, now she wet, we makin' love puddles

On the spread, on her bed at her momma's house
In the shower for 3 hours, ended on the couch
My backs shots got her shakin' like she been to Harlem
She wanna bring a friend, okay

My love is genuine, I hope yours is the same
And like genuine girl your whole life gon' change
I know Victoria got a secret hidden on the sheets
So come, come we can do it till we fall asleep

Come, come over here so I can break you off a lil' some
Put you in positions you ain't neva thought of
In between the sheets we can grind and bump
Make the bed thump until you

Come, come over here so I can break you off a lil' some
Put you in positions you ain't neva thought of
In between the sheets we can grind and bump
Make the bed thump until you come, come

Look girl, let me whisper somethin' to you
Somethin' like shit, I wanna do somethin' to you
Yeah, I like your smile, I really like your shape
So all I wanna know is when can we go?

So come, come girl, you know I gotta get you
Run run, and you can bring your friend with you
But trix is what I wanna see, do it how you want
Just be freaky as you wanna be

It's a go, bet you already know
Just one thang though, you already blow
Put you in positions you ain't neva been
Fold you up and put you legs where they ain't neva been

Shawty what's happenin'? What you thin' do?
Come ride with me 'cause I'm feelin' you
Big how I like 'em, I 'm feelin' you tryna' touch somethin'
I'm just crazy, just, just wanna fuck somethin'

You know what it is with me or where you might be
As somebody sorts the sweep with strong pipe, besh
Give it to you right, we gon' make the bed thump
Smash it to the head board, makin' your head pop

Do you how I wanna and how you like, girl
I know it sound good because it's right, girl
So come, come, never run, run
You want me like I want you so baby, come and get some

Come, come over here so I can break you off a lil' some
Put you in positions you ain't neva thought of
In between the sheets we can grind and bump
Make the bed thump until you

Come, come over here so I can break you off a lil' some
Put you in positions you ain't neva thought of
In between the sheets we can grind and bump
Make the bed thump until you come, come
