One:Kane & Abel
You got your own way of walkin'
You make some people follow you
Let your heart do the talkin'
'Cause it knows just what to do.
Yes - you're the one
Who knows where love comes from
You keep on turnin' me on
With a love affair that goes on an' on.
You have your own direction
But, sometimes, you follow mine
You don't need no correction
You seem perfect every time.
You're the kind
Who captures space and time
Straight from the heart to the mind
You keep on doin' it, time after time.
You're a 'One-of-a-kind' kinda lover
An' I love when you do what you do.
Don't need no sometime kinda lover
Just someone warm like you
An' you always come through when I needed you to.
Yes, you're the kind
Who captures space and time
Straight from the heart to the mind
You keep on doin' it, time after time.
You got your own way of walkin'
You make some people follow you
You let your heart do the talkin'
'Cause it knows just what to do.
Yes - you're the one
Who knows where love comes from
You keep on turnin' me on
With a love affair that goes on an' on.
