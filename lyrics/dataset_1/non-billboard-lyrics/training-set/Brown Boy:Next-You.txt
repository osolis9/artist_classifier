Next-You:Brown Boy
Yeah
Come on, girl
You know I love it when I'm next to you (When I'm next to you)
Yeah, when I'm next to you
Only you, girl (Oooh)
Mmm
Come on
When I'm next to you
I feel my heart going boom boom boom
When I'm next to you
I wanna do all the things that you wanna do
When I'm next to you
I can tell that I'm so in love with you
When I'm next to you
I probably go crazy if I didn't have you, baby
Cause every little thing that you do, you amaze me
It's the way that you walk
Your boy so soft
I love it when you talk
Whisper in my ear
Will you always be here
Cause I need you near
Living in my world
Standing by me, girl
I would never give you up
Not even for a million bucks
I must've been hit by an arrow
Shot by Cupid
Or could it be something you did
Cause my love for you
Only grows and grows
I wanna love you down, from your head, to your toe
Makin' love slow
Anyway you want it
Girl, you got me high on your sex like
Chronic
Your way
Right away
Let that Secret out
When you wear that lingerie
Like a touch of a rose
Our lips come close
The scent of your body
Makes me naughty
Your pretty brown skin
Makes me sin
I could never get enough
Even if you had a twin
Cause you got that touch, that special touch
Ain't no love lost, cause I love you too much
Ain't no need to rush
Let's take our time
And let's rewind
To the day we first kissed
Set Adrift On Memory Bliss
I thank God
For sending me this
A girl like you
Simple and cute
Don't care about my money
Cause you make your own loot
You're amazed by the smaller things
And what life brings
You think about the future
And what it could be
Just you and me
In ecstacy
Reality
Or a fantasy
As the years a-passed, and the days gone by
I thank you, girl
For standin' by my side
Better pick me up when a teardrop falls
From my eye
That'll put a smile on my face
When I frown
"Daddy, gimme kisses and hugs"
And when I'm down, forget about the rose, go around
Cause I only want you and only you
And girl, that's true, cause you know
When I'm next to you
I get this feelin' inside
That I just can't hide
No explanations
No room for temptations, your sexy little style
You drivin', meanwhile, got me feeling on your booty
Doin' my duty
Sittin' in paradise
Sippin' on somethin' nice
You'll never think twice, I took a chance on your lovin'
When I rolled the dice
And you know that, girl
When, I'm
Next, to
When I'm
Next to
