Dos-Equis:Xzibit
I'm a plastic surgeon, dick shape face,
I got Nascar novels, I was build to race.
Gone the long hot summer, I was gone through space,
It's the next best thing, making soda and base.
It ain't the drill at a hun', it ain't the people we're chasing
Or these bitches that you came to toot, is basically basic.
I'm getting white boy wasted, I'm waking up with a poor start,
She walking around naked like she my personal all star.
I push one button and boom: "hey, baby, how can I serve you today? "
Pussy wet like a typhoon. Ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon,
Immaculate back stroll, anal and deep throat,
Whatever the fuck I want you get to make it happen,
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action.
Shit, I'm about to miss my flight. First class to London, fucking with you all night.

Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her,
Because I don't care blowing kush in the air,
Dropping car, feeling like spaceships, riding with models and stripping ace in the club,
Show international girls how to do it with dub, while my chain swing left to right,
Came with the party with you, do it all night.
My money never run out, we party 'till the sun out,
We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out.

From west to uncut, working at home,
From BJ to YJ, now the J grown
One click of the wrist, I compare her to gun flight patrol,
On your turn flight to predator draw more.
Not to mention Pitbull bully razor heads, bloodline, Wu-Tang fans, police,
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for a fight,
Or the flash green lights meeting at your door sight.
Let's go to war now, off the world is steady,
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready.
Want your fingers sliced, now you pay the price,
Put your light on the line if you feel get that nice.
Running bullshit over here, get you shot,
Stupid, I retreat that, everything you're not.
Exits more the spot, that's everything that's hot,
Walk right upon you and run everything you've got.

My money never run out, we party 'till the sun out,
We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out.

I, I, I hit 'em with a nuke, get the pussy and they're scared to shoot,
My niggas get you with the 21 gun, salute.
I paratroop to your city, hit the club, recruit,
Let's see some titties.
Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest,
Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess,
I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down,
Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds,
Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds.
I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown,
It protect my self silence oppressed the sound.
You was up a body violence, working jaw to the ground,
Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now.
Hear it out, make them dollars work, smoking that loud.
