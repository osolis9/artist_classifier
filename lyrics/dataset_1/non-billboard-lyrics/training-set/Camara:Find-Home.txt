Find-Home:Camara
When you fear there's no tomorrow,
And there's nowhere else to go.
And the seeds of hope you planted,
Just won't grow.
Oh, the sound of pouring raindrops,
Drives a shadow pon your soul.
But a single ray of sunshine,
Gives you hope.
Said you gon' find
A way home, yes I know.
You will find, yeah
A way home, you never know.
It's alright, don't let the shadows fool ya.
I'm sending sunshine to ya, oh
This one goes out to you, when you feel you lost your way.
I want you to know that you don't have to worry, this one goes out to you.
Throughout years of mental pressure,
Get stuck in an endless dream.
Cause your fantasies become your reality.
Let me open up your window to your mind,
And you will find that
It's alright, don't let the shadows fool ya,
I'm sending sunshine to ya, oh
This one goes out to you, when you feel you lost your way.
I want you to know that you don't have to worry, this one goes out to you.
It's alright, don't let the shadows fool ya,
I'm sending sunshine to ya.
It's alright, don't let the shadows fool ya.
I'm sending sunshine to ya, oh
This one goes out to you, when you feel you lost your way.
I want you to know that you don't have to worry, this one goes out to you.
This one goes out to you.
