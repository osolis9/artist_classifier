Piece-of-tha-Pie:Slimm Calhoun
You roll deep, creep and get high
Roll without your heat, sleep and you die
'Cause everybody wants a piece of tha pie
Only one life to live, only one life to live

You roll deep, creep and get high
Roll without your heat, sleep and you die
'Cause everybody wants a piece of tha pie
Only one life to live, only one life to live

I kick it with big money niggaz, big heat gunners
2-4-7 street runners, slick talking stunners
Niggaz who'll melt your ice, and snatch your wife
Take your life, all for a price, that's right

See the grind been real, what's a hustler without steele?
That's like a rapper wit' no deal
A millionaire wit' no scrill

Simple niggaz stay small time, Nickel and Dime
And I gotta have it all if I'm committing the crime
Otherwise hustlin' just ain't worth mine
It's an all out grind, baby, it's an all out grind

Still on the grind, all out on a mission for mines
O.G.'s knocking fed time I'm still chasing da shine
Nineteen living a dream marine green, pearl all white guts
Living my life like what, wit' sixty sacks in my nuts

I slang lyrics like P's and keys for G's of course
And won't go hoarse, spit hot hits like sauce
I come across, make you and your boss get loss
Now, tell me this, don't want to fuck
With two Scorpios and a Sagittarius
Fully equipped wit' a stinga, red beama
Accurately take you and your whole teama

You roll deep, creep and get high
Roll without your heat, sleep and you die
'Cause everybody wants a piece of tha pie
Only one life to live, only one life to live

You roll deep, creep and get high
Roll without your heat, sleep and you die
'Cause everybody wants a piece of tha pie
Only one life to live, only one life to live

Yeah, only one life to live, so I live it, like it, love it
Don't owe a nigga shit so small talk I stay above it
When you see on da streets, I maybe lay back in a zone
Only business on my mind, planning to buy a yacht and a home
So to anybody having any itty bitty objections
The world's contrast, nigga just stay to your selection

I gotta passion for getting currency
I keep my eye on the coin at all time
Oh, these chips trying to make them all mines
So if the price of stock drop I got enough to re-cop
Never do we rock, see we stock

Beat rap to tracks 'till the coco bubble and pop
From soft to hard that's how the cookie get dropped
An all out grinder stays on top so believe me
We stay cheesy, you can ask Cool Breeze
How his partnas in the CP play

Me and ChamDon doin' it the G way
Jumped the 500 scudded
These broads got game so they gonna run it
First thang I saw was a three-piece
Thinking damn we three deep, got my eye on Miss Petite

Headed to the Calhoun suites wit' these treats
You know around the corner from Jesse Draper
Where I pulled my first paper caper
All my niggaz about grinding, but never small time in
That's how the south side stay shining, stay shining

You roll deep, creep and get high
Roll without your heat, sleep and you die
'Cause everybody wants a piece of tha pie
Only one life to live, only one life to live

You roll deep, creep and get high
Roll without your heat, sleep and you die
'Cause everybody wants a piece of tha pie
Only one life to live, only one life to live

You roll deep, creep and get high
Roll without your heat, sleep and you die
'Cause everybody wants a piece of tha pie
Only one life to live, only one life to live
