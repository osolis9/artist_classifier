Don-t-Talk-About-Love:Crimewave
[Verse 1]

I never call her a dime, just outta respect
She's more like the priceless coins people collect
It's hurts to think back -- and I don't talk too much about lovebut I'ma tell exactly how I feel
I agreed but never knew that pain was part of the deal
The scars to my heart are the type to never heal
Chewed and spit me out like I was part of the meal
It's probably cuz I acted like I can't feel
But I could, and it felt so good when I would
Never thought I'd fall in love with a chicken from the hood
She spoke like the sage, wise from experience and ageand taught me how to channel my rage
Said life is a book and every page is a stage
Never go by face value cuz the message is vague
Whipped like a slave, your love is all the rave
Ways so blazed, givin a praise to the shade
Man, we laid together - prayed together
I guess you forgot the empire we made together
It was small but had structure like a stone pillar
Then ya left an aftermath like the wrath of Godzilla
At least ya didn't want me for my scrilla
Cuz I was a beginner - if you stayed the pay-off woulda been iller
Woulda built you a mansion and a beach by the villa
Want a killa? Played the game similar to Reggie Miller
I thought I had it won 'til ya dropped the bomb
Took my jewels and basically pawned my leg and my arm
It ain't long... after the storm is the calm...

[Chorus]

Tell me why'd you treat this way...
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
I don't usually talk about love (about love)about love (about love) -- but I'ma tell you how I feel
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
Tell me why'd you treat this way...
I don't usually talk about love (about love)about love
