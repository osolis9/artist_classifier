We-Came-Here-To-Party:LMFAO
[CHORUS]
We came here to party
(ROCK!)
We didnt come here to fight
I said: ''Grab our selves a bottle''
A toast to the good life

Just 'cause a guy got a suit and a tie
Don't mean he gonna text ya
Just 'cause I walk with a limp like an old school pimp
Don't mean I slept

But If you wanna talk tough
And you wanna puff up
Then I'll make it just happen
But I ain't come here to fight

I came here to rock the house
Yeah, I get crazy and wild anything for the fans that make you scout
You say girls, guys are salad
And you think I'm a friend with you on now
But you know you just come to smoke

With the tech out cells with the words out in love
Stay at home, sit judge
We'll celebrate live
In the club

Everybody just wanna feel good
Your mud might happen with heels on the hood
Often times we can misunderstood
Tonight.. (Tonight)

[Chorus]
We came here to party
(ROCK!)
We came here to fight
I said: ''Grab our selves a bottle''
A toast to the good life

Stay calmed in soon time
You's a politician
They call me super fall
I'm always with some bitches

You go to church
But I ain't to much religious
You owe your pees in juice
I sip that gees juice

We all feel a lot attention in the curse
You still in books, I wanna be in the present day
We still in hooks, we always having sex
We all in hustle, So why we tossin' it?

Everybody just wanna feel good
Your mud might happen with heels on the hood
Often times we can misunderstood
Tonight.. (Tonight)

[Chorus]
We came here to party
(ROCK!)
We came here to fight
I said: ''Grab our selves a bottle''
A toast to the good life
(x2)

I came here to rock the house
(x8)

Roc, roc, roc, roc, rock the house
(x7)

[Chorus]
We came here to party
(ROCK!)
We came here to fight
I said: ''Grab our selves a bottle''
A toast to the good life
