You show me there's something more to us
Than the same old thing, no usual affair
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
Till you take me there, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
You show me there's something more to us
Than the same old thing, no usual affair
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
Till you take me there, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe
You've got a lot of love to give, love to give
Love to, love to, love to, love to, love, love, love, love
I will never dream of your love till you take me there
