J-:Jungle Brothers
Uncle Sam Mike G Baby Bam
Road-manager Chris this joint is slammin'
500000000000000000000000 boomin' watts
Sound system state of the art
Travel lytely clothes packed neatly
Strapped with the Baby Bam Baby Bam Beat see
Pull in early do the sound check
I wanna get on but the crowd ain't around yet
I scream out JUNGLE so you know that I'm here
Give a shout out to Smokey the Bear
It's almost time it's almost time
It's almost time to bring forth the rhyme
Any minute now any second now
Pay attention close we're gonna show you how
Come along everybody let's gather round
Once again we're gonna get on down
Give ya somethin' to go home and talk about
The odds were against us but we stayed and
fought it out
I heard you was long overdue
Who's comin' through yawl know who

Jmes Brown's getaway BRIDGE

Toe to toe yawl, blow for blow yawl
Mike G gonna show em what we know how
Indeed the seed of peace is here to give ya
what ya need
J. BEEz in the lead!
I took a plane 'cause it was just too far to swing
To bring my Jungle Thing
Packed my clothes gettin' ready for a trip
Planned my moves so my mind won't slip
I wrote some rhymes with a positive message
In case some head in the crowd might tape this
Very bad brother from another land
Known to the world as the Motherland
AfriKan can do and will achieve
To teach the world in what he believes
Another brother may try to bring me down
But I let 'em known I don't clown around
If ya play around then ya lay around
If ya lay around then ya stay around
Ya see ya can't keep a brother from doin' his do
So keep in mind J. BEEz comin' through!
