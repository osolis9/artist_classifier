Hood-Cake:The Lox
Anytime any of you punk ass niggas wanna say I took something from you
I never take nothing from you
I work too hard for mine baby
I go hard in this paint right here
You know what I love this
I'm a give it you before I take it from you bitch

Yeah, told my nigga real is real and bitch is bitch
If I ain't doing a deal I'm probably with ya bitch
You ain't gotta second guess you know I'm with the shits
I don't care about ya rep you know I get ya heaaadd
Yeah, rich is rich and broke is broke
You already know my niggas moving coke and dope
Got the sour, got the haze, we got both to smoke
Plus we fuck the baddest bitchest, that's from coast to coast
Get yaself robbed, stabbed, or pistol whipped
Mm, wherever we at you know we gets it lit
Shoot you in that same mouth that you dissed me with
But all that fuck shit you could miss me with

Uh, listen nigga real is real and bitch is bitch
Nigga broke is broke and rich is rich
So all that in between you could miss me with
Yeah all that fuck shit you could miss me with
Told my nigga rich is rich and broke is broke
Whip it with ya wrist my nigga, dope is dope
So all that in between you could miss me with
And all that fuck shit you miss me with

You could miss me with it
Sucking my dick all night then she go home and kiss you with
What you jealous for? Cause I'm on tour, and I ain't standing in front of no store?
With a beer in my hand, one blunt rolled
3 grams, talking about moving raw
Where the lawyer at? Where that bail money?
Where them 100 racks when it's real money
Rich is rich broke is broke
Sour, haze, smoke is smoke
I'm getting money when I ain't awoke
When them guns is out it ain't a joke
Bottles pop, then trippy stix
Got her wallin' out on them IG pics
Take her home for a couples of bucks
2 chainz voice' suck all the dicks
Nigga we don't care about you
When it go down we don't care we shoot
As long is that money's there in that duffel bag
B.I.G. nigga gimme the loot
I learned from Puff, I learned from Hov
Baking soda I learned the stove
Did the coupe, did the rove
Got millions nigga if I'm getting old

They told you money talk, what it saying to you?
100 shots fired they ain't playing with ya
All that in between you could miss me with
I'm in the limousine, French cuisine, with some prissy bitch
No promethazine, just some wax and my trippy stix
Got ahead flip
If I don't get you killed I get you pistol whipped
Louchy, Kiss and I
And some niggas that act ludicrous
Send yo ass to Lucifer, show you what elusive is
I don't give a fuck, I sit my dick on medusa's lips
I don't have a gun I get you hawked with a crucifix
This is Ghost, this dblock, this is LOX
This is till your head a mess

Moving with the tooly they done got me on my drilling shit
All we moves militant
Jada gone and kiss the shit
If involving currency I get it done I'm diligent
Known for causing homicides when I get the pinning shit
Real is real and bitch is bitch
Poor is poor and rich is rich
Claim you not a bitch well the fuck you in ya feelings bitch
I could send a 100 clues they still may never get the jit
Smell me nigga get a whiff
Pooper scooper up in the shit
Gone
