Houstatlantavegas:Drake
Hey there, pretty girl, you know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all, you can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright and the money so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave, she just stuck in

Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas

And she dance to this song
And she dance to this song and it go
Hey, now, now, watch her go down, oh

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas

And she dance to this song
And she dance to this song and it goes
Hey, now, now, watch her go down, oh

We all got dreams and we all star reaching
All star peaking, all star weekend
One hotel room and all y'all sleeping
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent

Young girls envy the life y'all leading
Never satisfied with a nice calm evening
You be at the games looking right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leaving

Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who

Or why or how or when
Tonight is probably about to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself it's impossible to lose you

Because I never had you although I would be glad to
I probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas, Houstatlantavegas

And she dance to this song
And she dance to this song and it goes
Hey, now, now watch her go down, oh
