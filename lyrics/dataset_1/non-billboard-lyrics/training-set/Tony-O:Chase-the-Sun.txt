Chase-the-Sun:Tony-O
I'm flying away
Running like the wind
As I chase the sun
Up spinning around
Circles in my mind
Sailing over the ground
Sailing over the ground
I'm flying away
Running like the wind
As I chase the sun
Up spinning around
Circles in my mind
Sailing over the ground
Sailing over the ground
I'm flying away
Running like the wind
As I chase the sun
Up spinning around
Circles in my mind
Sailing over the ground
Sailing over the ground
I'm flying away
Running like the wind
As I chase the sun
Up spinning around
Circles in my mind
Sailing over the ground
Sailing over the ground
I'm flying away
Running like the wind
As I chase the sun
Up spinning around
Circles in my mind
Sailing over the ground
Sailing over the ground
I'm flying away
