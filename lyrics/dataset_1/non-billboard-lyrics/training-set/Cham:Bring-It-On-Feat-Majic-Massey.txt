We do it for the streets (who else) the hustlas (and) the gangstas, the hood lovers
Cause we, keeps it gutter and oh so grimey
Looking for me, on the block is where you'll find me
And I'm probably counting dirty money
Or with a thick chick, big thick jamaican honey
And one a them rude boy toys
Disturbing the peace, bringing that noise (wahwow)
Or I'm probably just chilling with Cham
Or in the dope spot, with the scale, counting them grams (fo' sure)
But I'm, for the word brick
1-800-pusha sweet supply that fix (heh)
