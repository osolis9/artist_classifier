To-My:Timbaland
It don't stop
Can't stop
Say what?
Play your parts

Uh, huh, it don't stop
Nas Esco'
Say what? Huh, uh, huh
Uh, huh, it don't stop

Uh, uh, huh, uh, uh, uh
It don't stop, what?
Yeah, yeah, Brave hearts
Guess what, y'all? Check it

I, splash y'all dudes with gats I use
Ice dangle off my chest 'cause my cash improve
Nice knuckle game, chip toothed, way of buck and change
I want the dough, fuck the fame

Already made history, y'all can have that, that ain't shit to me
About to have my own ASCAP and that's that
And plus a rotisserie instead of Kenny Rogers
And Benihana's, y'all can eat, plenty at Nas'

Buffet of lobsters, dressed in Esco' boxers
With honies that sex so proper, best flow since Rakim
Liver, personification of drama
Describe my characteristics, murder co-signer

Some will smoke embalmin' fluid and vomit to it
I'm straight chronic, yo, it's atomic, how I blew up
Same ol' G, since I rocked Kangol's, Lee's
Nothin' changed but my bankroll, still jig to the ankles

Please to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my gangsters
To my riders, to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my niggaz

To my riders, to my gangsters
To my bitches, to my niggaz
And fly assholes, to my niggaz
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'

Yo, yo, we rippin' tracks, it's like beatin' beats with bats
Watchin' crews change the views when the heat in they back
If you hear a click, trust me, you wouldn't hear clack
If you push it up front, I got no choice but to pull it back

Your rhymes don't faze me, I'm above 'em, half y'all raps is
Born retarded, now you out here tryin' to get rid of 'em
You should be sick of it, I posess no flaws
That's from the man that made your head nod 'til you licked his balls

Verses, I spit 'em, when it's my turn to get 'em, I got hot flows
I only do shows for burn victims
So cock this mic and bust out your back, kill you
And then they gonna blame me for fuckin' up rap

Who's fuckin with that? Skillz and Esco', it's on
When you speak in my direction watch your tone
From QB to VA, can't count the blocks we own
It's locked and sewn, I repeat nigga, watch your tone

Please to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my gangsters
To my riders, to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my niggaz

To my riders, to my gangsters
To my bitches, to my niggaz
And fly assholes, to my niggaz
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'

Yo, come see
The big man with the diamonds and the fly Bentleys
Ladies love me, niggaz say
Timbaland's really rappin', what the fuck is up, B?

Jealousy
I kill niggaz with seven thangs, most they jackin' beats
I'm a eight digit niggy
Maybe, I just rebuild Titanic and send that out to see, what?

Please to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my gangsters
To my riders, to my niggaz
To my bitches, to my niggaz

To my riders, to my gangsters
To my bitches, to my niggaz
And fly assholes, to my niggaz
To my bitches, Timbaland and Esco'
