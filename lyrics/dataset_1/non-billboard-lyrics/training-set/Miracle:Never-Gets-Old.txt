Never-Gets-Old:Miracle
one]
You can say we livin' a dream
Don't wanna wake up from these memories
And realise that it was never meant to be
Cause real life, sometimes it don't feel right
Theres nothing that i would've done differently
I used to cut class just to puff grass
To sittin in the front four, sittin in the back
Throwin??? up out the window, hopin that we wouldn't crash
Do it all tomorrow, you ain't even gotta ask
Uh, lookin back on these good times
We were young and only looking for a good time
Every weekend was an open house party
All the boys tryna pick up with no good lines
Back of the party thats where everyone would make out
And if the cops came everyone would breakout

We take a bus to the city
And a ferry to the beach
Ipod full of tunes
Skateboard on my feet
And I'm gone

Holding onto a dream we have
Never let it go so we packed out bags
Been all around the world, and this life
It never gets old, it never gets old

They say we living a dream
Roll a paper plane
Light it up, light it up, lets get high again
Higher up, higher up, like that fireman
And we could touch the sky till it burns
Uh, pool parties on Australia Day
Couple beers, couple babes, the Australia way
Everyday's a celebration
Sippin till we faded
Lifestyle we forgot that we're like history in the making
Music so loud, neighbours wanting us out
Funny, we turn into kids our parents warned us about
In the streets coming up, we were running amuck
Dodgin' the uniforms tryna put us in cuffs
Remember when we used to jump across the train lines?
Cause we didn't wanna end up with the train fine

These times will never fade, this is who we are
This time, we run away from who we are
These times will never fade, this is who we are
All we know is
This time, we run away from who we are
Not from home

They say we never succeed
They say we still in a dream
This life is all that we need
Cause we're livin' a dream, uh
