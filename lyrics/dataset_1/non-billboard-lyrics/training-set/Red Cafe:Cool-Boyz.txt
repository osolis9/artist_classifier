And we gonna do whatever ever whatever we want
And we gonna do whatever ever we like
Boys boys so what you like
Boys boys so what you like

Hole up, hole up hole up
I'm cooler than December first
Take my minks out the freezes on November first
i'm running through your time that be your red alert
I don't take my shoes off when i'm in a hurry
Look at my dog all in when i play my cards
Blowing loud while i'm driving i never respect the law
i got a hot girl but i'm a cool boy
drop the sour in the trunck watch it move boy
i don't camouflage i'm a gudda nigga bitch
i'm a thug a bitch even if i love a bitch
on the grind money coming like a horny bitch
i block the money train and i'm only bitch
only thing changed i tell em keep the change
came in the rap game balling off some cocaine
champagne Og cush since Jenny from the block single
wonder if she tryin smush

Hook:
‘cause we the cool boyz so rgaba cup and put your bottles up
‘cause we the cool boyz
And we gonna do whatever ever whatever we want
And we gonna do whatever ever we like
Boys boys , so what you like
Boys boys, so what you like

I guess this where we say goodbye
is it a new beginning? 
I hope so because before she knew we was winnin
She so crazy bad bitch from the ceiling
A white top spur i call em Bill Clinton
Double cup sippin they watch me as im ridin out
For the first time i finally see what living lifes about
and it feels good to take my niggas out the hood
Cause some of dem aint make it they would be here if they could
i'm just cruising through the streets, 
like im cruising on the weed
Cool boyz nigga, go find a place to eat
‘cause we about to have a feast 
and no need to be discrete
Since 1998 classic shit to say the least
When i make a mill like me 
what you're thinking we was doing
Tim Allen baby bout to do some Home Improvement
and kick my feet up and smoke up on this QP
so turn the beat up, cause we don't give a fuck

[Hook:]

Don't get the misconception who im tryin to be
I'm just tryin to live my life
I'm just tryin to outbeat 
I told spur when we make it its on me
How ironic when you rich everything you gets free
Every other day another show
They just wanna see me fall wanna see me curtains closed
Bout to take flight youre better of landing
cause this is our year what about that you aint understanding
Lawn chair flow, rich boy swag for why i'm so poppin 
you can blame that shit on my dad
To All of my fans i wanna thank you in advance
And to all of my haters heres a toast so raise your glass
Skateboard shoes big boy cash cool boy hoe whips Steve Nash
All white, windows all tinted 
dont get offended mufucka cause we in it, heh

[Hook:]
‘cause we the cool boys boyz boyz boyz
We the cool boyz boyz boyz
‘cause we the cool boyz boyz boyz
‘cause we the cool boys boyz boyz boyz
Shake down
