Life-s-Quest:8Ball & MJG
If I'd die today I wrote this song to let you know I love you so
Always on my mind even though I'm always on the go
I wish the best for you and I always want you to try your best
May god bless your journey do all out your lifes quest
Life quest oh yeah
May god bless your journey do all out your lifes quest
Life quest ohh

Chorus:
I only know what I do best
Give it my all and nothing less
I get it in with no regrets
I'm on a journey to life's quest
I'm ever do my home girl
What don't kills me makes me strong girl
There it is in life you choose to do
We got the shit journey bruise like this

If I'd die today I wrote this song to let you know I love you so
Always on my mind even though I'm always on the go
Money is so important to me 'cause all we tryin to get it
It hurt me when you leave some and I can't just go and get it
Crazy how I used to be so reckless before I was with me
Taking near pay for granted even being young and gifted
Then you said he get... get lazy he was going first
Came out looking just like me I can see his face while I'm writing this verse
I was on tour and I will forget it
The sun is summer day my... was pulled up in Memphis
Rolling with DJ rizzle... got a call on my phone
Pulled up at the hospital just the time to see you fun
Got them blank is time to little brown baby smile
And now I know you're growing up
And I will always make you happy
But I want the best for you and I always want you to try your best
May God bless your journey do all your lifes quest

Chorus:
I only know what I do best
Give it my all and nothing less
I get it in with no regrets
I'm on a journey to life's quest
I'm ever do my home girl
But what don't kill me makes me strong girl
There it is in life you choose to do
We got the shit journey bruise like this

If I die today I wrote this song to let you know
I love you so, always on my mind even though I'm always on the go
Listen I ain't have no daddy but there's common where we come from
I said I'll be the greatest and if one day I ever become one
Look out it I know you try to hard but life is hard
You just pay quick and was stuck and hard
Man you gotta help hard
And I know you got it in 'cause you remind me of myself
And you look just like me but on the inside what I'm talking bout
Nad Leyla my only lady please respect yourself
Know the heaven baby ain't the only way to share your love
And I know my music may confusion but you gotta be strong
My life a mirror and reflections come out in my song
And told you, you just a baby young and innocent
When your mama tried I know I gave a hundred and 10%
But I want the best for you and I always want you to try your best
And God bless your journey do all your lifes quest


[Chorus:]

Life quest oh yeah
May god bless your journey do all out your lifes quest
Life quest ohh
