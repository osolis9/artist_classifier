I found you, get on…
I founded you get, get, get
I found you! (x2)

Yeah! Standing at the bus stop, wonder where I sit,
This love….come across the street.
Shwaty look good, so I’m trying to…
Play my game down, see if she a swallower.
…feel the blood flowing, cause I’m staring in her ass!
I say what’s your name, she just looked,
Must have thought I was playing, but…
Drowning in the air, hopefully she’ll take the bait,
Put her in too, I want her to feel the air.
She’s giving me blink stares, but I know…
Back waiting on the bus, probably got her…
It’s a… can’t get her…

She fluttered her love..,
But I want her to get to open.
I don’t know where I heard shots rang out,
But it’s been nine in the summer time, bring that down!
Everybody duck, then under.. Shawty was lying flat,
Must have got…
What a fuck?
Reaching my phone, call 911,
She replied I don’t want to die, leave my sons!
As the tears start rolling down her face, she said thanks,
By the way, my name is Grace!
Amazed!

I found you, get on…
I founded you get, get, get
I found you! (x2)
