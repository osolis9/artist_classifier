Catch-Me-At-the-Light:Young Money
feat. Shanell & Yo Gotti


[Intro]
It's Sha-motherf-nell, yeah, Yo Gotti, uh-uh
Ohh-whyyyyy, ohhh, yeah

[Hook]
Catch me at the light, when you see me rolling
You ain't got a fast car, might as well keep going
Catch me at the light, and you better be riding right
With the suicide doors on the side
Catch me at the light (the light) I see you creeping up
If you want some conversation, speed it up
Catch me at the light, catch me at the light
Buckle up let me take you on a ride

[Verse 1: Shanell]
Pull up top back I'm back
Drop top's got me feeling so alive oh yeah
In my new thing paint all black
Whips game got the haters hit the ties oh yeah
I got 200 on the dash
Looking like I'm flying in a space ship, nothin' to play with
Cause if I'm talking to a man
He better right like me, meeee

[Bridge]
If you're a maserati roller
Bentley and your holding
Looking like a Benz or a Beamer when you're rollin
Jaguar elise show me you can keep up with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Chea, yo...
I may pull up in that Lambo, doors like Diani
Yeah me speak English but shawty this a foreign
Real shit, shawty this could be your rent
Need some excitement in your life and you lookin' boring
Lemme hit you in the back of that Range Panoramic view
Murcie lane, at the light, it's just me and you
I got Raris with them horses, different color Porsches
If you got a need for speed, shawty know that we got choices
Shawty know that we got options, so if you into shopping
Buyin bags is not a issue, having budgets not an option
You got that wide body like a steering
Got a nigga fellin sprung shawty like a Visa
All gas, no brakes, shawty that's a speed race
V-V12, vroom vroom, I can make ya knees shake
I just need that green light (green light) yellow light
Slow it down shawty, I can do it right, I am
