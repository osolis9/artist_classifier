Shortie-Like-mine:Chris Brown
Y'all know what this is

[Chorus]
Only thing that keeps me up when I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you, but I gotta keep mines around 'cause
I done looked out and searched, and it's hard to find another shorty like mine
Baby, yes, I'm addicted to how we kick it, everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hopin' that you stay wit' me
Search around the world, but you will never find another shorty like mine
Shorty like mine

You got a girl, but she ain't nothin' like (mine)
Cute face, nice size, like (mine)
Fake kitted hood wit' it like (mine)
Mean walk, talk the talk
Let me tell you some more

I knew when I ran into this one, she would be the redrum of my pimpin'
Knew she would be the one to make me stop caring
About other girls on my jock, and gettin' them
She was the one to slow me down, hold me down
I roll wit' her now, go wit' it now
I'm a grow wit' it now
I'm a go get her now
I got her; don't be mad you can't get one holla
Broke the mold when they made lil' mama
I don't care what my niggas say
She been there everyday for my drama
Some of the homies hate 'cause they want her
Wish they the ones that's datin' my woman
Gon' get a good look 'cause she fine
And I don't mind 'cause she mine

[Chorus]

You got a girl, but she ain't nothin' like (mine)
Cute face, nice size, like (mine)
Fake kitted hood wit' it like (mine)
Mean walk, talk the talk, Chris, help me tell them was up

All this love inside of me, and all I wanna do is give it to her
I don't care what the fellas say 'bout it 'cause I got somethin' to say 'bout it
What I'm about to say is straight up real talk; no cut, I don't play 'bout it
There ain't a price you can put on a girl who knows just what to say when
You need to hear it the most, and I'm a tell you somethin' else if
I don't know nothin' else, I know...

[Chorus]

You got a girl, but she ain't nothin' like (mine)
Cute face, nice size, like (mine)
Fake kitted hood wit' it like (mine)
Mean walk, talk the talk, let me tell you some more

I wanna give her the world, and I ain't even tryin' a lose her
I'm addicted to my girl and the way that she works in that little skirt
Just for me in the club, in the crib, in the streets
She reps for l-b-dub-e-n-t; she a nice size with the pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a winner wit' the right prize
I'm a give it to her to the rhythm of a hi-hat
She got a beautiful mind
You can't buy that, and the site from behind when she walk on by make a
Nigga wanna try that
She got the prettiest smile, and she gangsta keep me
From runnin' wild, and I thank her, and we can talk about anything she got
Good conversation, my homie, little friend, and plus, she patient

[Chorus]

You got a girl, but she ain't nothin' like (mine)
Cute face, nice size, like (mine)
Fake kitted hood wit' it like (mine)
Mean walk, talk the talk, Chris, help me tell them was up

[Chorus]
