Follow-Me:Bow Wow
I'm game
I'm game

I see that y'all wanna be like the Boy Wonder
Well, don't they all
So just sit back and relax and let me holla at y'all
This how you be me

It's me, capital B, rap li'l B
Different after me, what a disaster to see
It's a fact that no other cat attractive as me
Can't no other MC step in my I Vs
But see, I wrote a booklet for you to get the game on track

A couple platinum plaques number one
It's apparent you gotta appeal the parents be real
Won't they see through you like you transparent
Number two, I scan the whole world in panoramic
Find a loophole, develop my flow then I ran with it

Now step number three, ha, it ain't that easy
Gotta listen close if you wanna be wheezy
Dress wired, make sure yo' attire stay hot
Top to bottom, got them school girls cryin'
Step four, you gotta make sure yo style remains raw

But wait, there's more, yeah

All you young'ns tryna do it how I done it
What I been y'all wanna become it but it's nothin' now, follow
All you kids tryna get it how I get it, wanna spit it how I live it
Won't you listen, then follow

All you young'ns tryna do it how I done it
What I been y'all wanna become it but it's nothin' now, follow
All you kids tryna get it how I get it, wanna spit it how I live it
Won't you listen, then follow

Yeah, gotta have some attitude, can't dress sloppy
Talk with some slang and you gotta act cocky
Make sure yo pants sag low and if you rockin' a New Era, fit it
Make sure that yo stickaz show

It's a must that you rock two chains
'Cuz dawg where I'm from, well, money ain't a thang
Clothes gotta be over sized, tires real wide
Gotta pay my dime over just so she can ride

Gotta be real smooth, be too cool
Gotta be that cat that guy, that dude
If you wanna be Bow, watch how I walk this
Easy, sit back, listen while I'm talkin'

Make sure you shoot game is up to par
Make sure you remain number one on 106 and Park
Gotta like ya girls ghetto, gotta be a headliner
Gotta be a platinum back to back rhymer, I'm game

All you young'ns tryna do it how I done it
What I been y'all wanna become it but it's nothin' now, follow
All you kids tryna get it how I get it, wanna spit it how I live it
Won't you listen, then follow

All you young'ns tryna do it how I done it
What I been y'all wanna become it but it's nothin' now, follow
All you kids tryna get it how I get it, wanna spit it how I live it
Won't you listen, then follow

Follow me, follow me but don't lose yo grip
Get yo cornrows and shell toes and learn how to skip
Mix that wit a throwback and a flow that's sick
Now hold that pose right there, that's almost it

And if you wanna copy my jewels
Don't go and get no Loony Tunes tryna do what I do
Like dude, I got more karats than that wascaly rabbit
And it's a fact that I'm responsible for y'all funny rappers

I try to let it ride fo a minute
But every time I get a sentence its like y'all re-spit it
Re-admit into the system right after I did it
You get it, you make a livin' off the way that I'm livin'

Copy my image, so I wanna percentage
Listen, don't be sloppy, I'll show you how to get it
You gotta rhyme hotter, dress proper
So you got a lotta ladies and diamonds in yo' pocket now, You got it?

All you young'ns tryna do it how I done it
What I been y'all wanna become it but it's nothin' now, follow
All you kids tryna get it how I get it, wanna spit it how I live it
Won't you listen, then follow

All you young'ns tryna do it how I done it
What I been y'all wanna become it but it's nothin' now, follow
All you kids tryna get it how I get it, wanna spit it how I live it
Won't you listen, then follow
