Prepare to die, bye (Laugh) 

Chorus: No bwoy caan dis mi and no end up dung a mispa

Verse 1: A wha tek batter foot quami 'bout him a run place 
A flee when the real shotta dem touch base 
Police back him up and give him 32 straight 
Thru him always hype and a carry screw face

Leaving holes in yuh looking like a crate
