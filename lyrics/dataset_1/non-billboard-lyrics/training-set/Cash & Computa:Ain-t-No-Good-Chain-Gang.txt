Bet it ain't rainin' back home,
Bet your sister's still on the phone.
Bet Momma's in the kitchen, cooking fried chicken,
Wishing that I hadn't done wrong.

Yeah, Momma, don't you worry about it none though,
Everything's gonna be all right, Momma.
They're teaching us a lot of new things in here, Momma;
Things like:

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman.
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James.
And you don't go writin' hot cheques, down in Mississippi.
And there ain't no good chain gang.

Papa's readin' yesterday's mail,
Wishin' that the hay was all baled.
I bet he's a-wishin', we could go fishin'.
And here I am a-laying in jail.

Well, Papa, don't you worry about it none now,
Everything's gonna be all right, Papa;
They're teaching us a lesson a day; we're learning pretty well, too.
We've already learned a whole lot of stuff already;
Things like:

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman.
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James.
And you don't go writin' hot cheques, down in Mississippi.
And there ain't no good chain gang.

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman.
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James.
And you don't go writin' hot cheques, down in Mississippi.
And there ain't no good chain gang.

There ain't no good in an evil-hearted woman.
And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James.
And you don't go writin' hot cheques, down in Mississippi.
And there ain't no good chain gang.
