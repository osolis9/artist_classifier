THE-GOOD-STUFF:Far East Movement & Riff Raff
Give me the love I'm lookin' fo'
Give me the love I'm lookin' fo'
Give you the love you lookin' fo'
The whole world knows the sun is so hot
'cause you got soul, we got soul

Big shouts to the haters on the side steady gabbin'
They don't understand I love music with a passion
Made a lot of sacrifices tryna get this crackin'
So who the hell is you to tell me what I can't do
Whattchu know 'bout workin' 9-5 to stay alive
Been writin' all night, till the moon, sleepy eye
On the bus everyday, face planted in a book
Im'ma future rock star, better take a good look
Same thang, different day, I put my all into my songs
Hold it close like a mom with an infant in her arms
Lovin' life 'cause I felt my lights almost turnin' off
But I gotta second lease on my feast and it's drawn
Then I'm straight fo' my homies always there fo' support
Plan ahead fo' tomorrow, pass a blunt back and forth
Sunny days, many more, but first comes the storm
FM here to give you what you lookin' fo'

You gotta give me the love I'm lookin' fo'
I wanna give you the love you lookin' fo'
Gimme the love, give you the love
'cause you got soul, we got soul
You gotta give me the love I'm lookin' fo'
I wanna give you the love you lookin' fo'
The whole world knows the sun is so hot
'cause you got soul, we got soul

Yo, I play the crystals, shoot missles all around the world
Spread the love like heat rash my boys and girls
That's Jsplif, Prohgress is thee MC, Kevnish is the recipe
Bakin' love in the oven is too hot, but real. Too cold to chill
Three equals one eye open 'cause my vision is how I want chu to feel
Protectin' all my humans with a love force field, real
Love uncondional like Grandmama Nish
Fried egg and home potatoes in the mornin' I miss
My flow is next to sero, but I don't even trip
I work enough fo' three people and I barely make rent
One love up in Seattle to my parents and sis
LA is where I'm reppin' with a love and a fist
My heart is fo' the world, that means all you girls
But I can only give out one kiss mwah

You gotta give me the love I'm lookin' fo'
I wanna give you the love you lookin' fo'
Gimme the love, give you the love
'cause you got soul, we got soul
Gimme the love, give you the love
The whole world knows the sun is so hot
we got soul

Pops told me that to be a star, you gots to know who you are
I took that, and now I put my focus on rap
And find people who can do what I can't
And that's my heart, yea my first line of defense
So everday you see me mendin' some fences
Just in case you think I'm gettin' pretentious
'cause I forgot to put cha name on the guest list
I can't say they accusations are senseless
But understand the fans gettin' extensive
I feel the pressure and it's gettin' tremendous
If you could only take a look through my lenses
You see that everything is not what it seems
We gotta pass and you know what I mean
For right now, I just gotta follow my dreams
I'll be back, you just gotta believe
Trust me
