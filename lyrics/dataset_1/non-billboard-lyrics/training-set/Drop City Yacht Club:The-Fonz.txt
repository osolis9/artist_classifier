The-Fonz:Drop City Yacht Club
[A Wolf]
(Yeah)
I sit and dream 'til the wheels fall off
Sold my soul to the music, now the deal's all off
Keep my mind on the money, my money's on my monologue
Bloods cold can't get cash for a heart of gold
No said I, you can keep the red eye
No fly by night rather be a young Jedi
Livin' on the edge I'm
Dancin' on the ledge
Lookin' down
Middle finger to the people on the ground
That told me I couldn't fly
So I put a couple mountains in my way that I could climb look at I
Now I'm, buddy Holly
The party in my brain's like Mardi Gras
And i am not afraid to bare it all
Sorry, I got a problem bein' cocky
Bottom line not a cloud in the sky that could top me
And I don't care at all, I'm the best here
I'm in the wind -- that's why they're callin' it fresh air

[Hook]
I'm so fly
Every time I'm walking by
All the girlies saying hi
I'm just doin' what I want, I'm as cool as the Fonz

[Kristo]
I wanna stay fly but not in the sense of heights
Not like airplanes or the sense of kites
And if I could then I would put this ink in a pipe
Cuz that's sorta like the feelin that I get when I write (uh)
Call Amelia Earhart tell her lets elope
We could meet the airport
From there on we're livin life without a care at all
Superfly, Mary Poppins with a parasol
I got a couple more stairs to crawl
Good thing I'm not scared to fall not at all
Not even a little bit
Birds eye view so everything lookin' different
Yeah I got a brand new angle
Devil on my shoulder turned into a blue angel
With a new halo gravity on pay roll so
We ain't comin' down until we say so

[Carlito]
I see 'em dancin' on the rooftops
So put another dime in the jukebox
Turn it up turn it up lets go
Bang it till your speakers blow
Everybody say Oh oh (oh oh) oh oh (oh oh)
I'm the coolest thing since ice I'm the coolest thing since ice
