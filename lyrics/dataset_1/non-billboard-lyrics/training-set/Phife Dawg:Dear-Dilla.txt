Dear-Dilla:Phife Dawg
Dilla dawg, I had a dream about you fam
It's 2005, we in the same hospital room
You on one side, I'm on the other
I'm stressed out,
but what gave me motivation was you pulling out that MP
And bangin' out some bangers as usual

Nothin' ever phased you fam, and for that, I miss you
D-Town throw it up
NYC throw it up

The whole world throw it up
BK
Hold tight, this ain't the last time I see you
Due time, that's my word imma see you
Frontin' ass rappers now here stealin' intros
Posin' like they hard when we know they all see-through
Imma tell you Dilla why they lackin' skills now
No stage presence, cadence, style
They livin' off of hooks, skinny jean crooks
Pre-K lyrics, why would I need a book?
I reminisce, reminisce, when Mobb dropped shook
Shan was down by law, such a good look
Nas God's Son his return was Stillmatic
Distortion to Static, You and Slum Fantastic
Thought I'd chop you out son see how you're doin
Come back to earth homie, hip hop is in ruins
I'm a third of the Tribe but Imma speak for the click

What up though, we miss you kid
Motor city say
Jay Dee flip another beat for me x 4
