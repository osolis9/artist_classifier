Suckas-Come-Try-Me:Dem Franchize Boyz
Suckas come and try me
They goin find yo body If a nigga try me, then he goin die
I keep my tool cock like Debo's eyes
And when I draw down
Ana tryin to scare you
I make you 1, 2, step like ya name Ciara
Put yo cha vest round yo head
Protect yo face
I been gettin money like collection plates
I put yo face on a shirt
and fronted on front page
Try me if you wanna
I got more nines then fourth grade
I re-up on the first then again on the third
I'm in tha hood like a fire hydrogen, sittin on the curb
And I got heart, I got grain, I got pills boy
I'm on da block posted up like a billboard
And I got that torch, so you know that I blast metal
If you went away, we steppin on you like a gas pedal
And I got that linen squeeze so I grip my pipe tight
Most of these niggas mad cause we shinin like some bright lights

sucka, sucka, sucka, sucka come and try me sucka come and try me
they goin find yo body I got hoes fo days
Dro fo days
A choppa that sprays
I keep that thrown away
Sucka nigga wanna try
yo ass goin die
6 feet under the dirt, you lie
So duck when I buss
I shot yo ass off angle
Dripping blood on my shoes
Dry yo ass on a hanger
We da true, who care, Franchise lets get it
These niggas soft then snuggles
and big ass titties
I keep da croon piece nigga
And my fingas stay flicking
They say I need some Bendadryl
cause that bitch stay itching
It's getting hot in my kitchen
I stay cookin, I'm bad
Ah get mad, I have you redder then maxxy pads
Maceo told u niggas bout fucking wit Drez
I gotta a click of niggas ready to put one in yo head
Stretch you out on the bed and slap a tag on yo toe
I told u niggas wit big Omp, Hoe.

Sucka, Sucka, Sucka, Sucka Come And Try Me Suckas Come And Try Me
They goin find yo body
