Shades:Diddy - Dirty Money
Uh, before you get here
Put yo panties in yo pocketbook
That's what I told her, over the Motorola
Hennessy and Cola

I hold her at attention with my manors
And even though I don't roll a camera
She still performs
Like the superstar, she truly are

So, also I think I love her already
Damn, I think I already
She must be the one
I look in her eyes and see the sun

Even on rainy days, ain't it
Crazy mayne, yeah, that's what I said
She do doughnuts in my head
Over and over, and over

'Til the cops pull her over
And then she say some real slick shit like
"I'm on my way from Weezy, baby"
And of course they let her go

I know I got a lot of baggage
It's for the ladies and Mercedes
And I know that it's heavy
But I pray that someone will grab it for me

I know I got a lot of baggage
Full of Chanel's and Tiffany's and broken hearts girl
You need me baby, it's hard to break a habit
For me, yeah

And girl if you want
I pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart
Just to light your cigarette
Girl, if you want

(I'll do anything for you)
I'll do anything for you
(I'll even take off my shades)
I'll even take off my shades

And stare right at the sun from the stage
(I'll even try different things)
I'll even try different things

I'll make love to you on marmalade
(Never made love on marmalade)
I'll even change my name, name

What you say
(I'll be whatever you say)
I'll be whatever you say
I'll even try different things

I'll make love to you on marmalade
(Are you sure that's what you want to do)
If that's what you want to do

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when I'm perfect for you?
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy
And love's gon' turn you up, baby
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when I'm perfect for you?
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy
And love's gon' turn you up, baby
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy

Got a lot of baggage it's full of shades
Different shades
And I'm sharp as a razor that's why I have to brand it
You talking 'bout me
(You talking 'bout me)

Listen to me
I know I got a lot of baggage
It's full of promises that why I keep a lock on it
I promise girl, I'm trying to make it happen for me
And you, babe

Now girl if you wanna pour
A gallon of gasoline on my heart
And light it if you get lonely if you call me
Girl, if you call me, if you want me
I'm ready when you are, just tell me you want me

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when I'm perfect for you?
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy
And love's gon' turn you up, baby
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do when I'm perfect for you?
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy
And love's gon' turn you up, baby
Girl, watch how it's gon' drive you crazy

Black, gray, white
If I pull down these shades would I sound too bright?
Get it, sound too right
Maybe I'm just feeling myself because
"Flashing lights come from everywhere"

And you can feel that something's blowing in the air tonight
Now if you need that fire I'll be that propane
If you need it wet I'll make it pour rain
But maybe I won't, maybe you just have to take it

Go ahead pretend I'm a drug
Now let me see you shake it
I can read your mind, read your mind, Professor X
We can press rewind, press rewind, VHS

Speaking of the past, it's so futuristic behind ya
Let me fill up your plate and dish it out, dish it out, China
I'ma bend yo body, bend yo body, Magneto
Let me have my way, I'ma have my way, Carlito

Now we can put in work, let me get my busy on for you
You ain't never heard you talk like this
It's got my Drizzy on for you
