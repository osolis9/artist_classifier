What-Da-Hook-Gon-Be:Murphy Lee
Ha ha ha, yo, yo, yo, yo
You never met a nigga like me
Yo, yo, have you ever seen a little dude
Who be doing what I do?
Uh huh, yo, whoo! Let's get at it, dog, whoo!

Now, what goes up, must come down
(Shiiett)
But we ain't coming down, it be them same ole' clowns
Aiming your pound pretending they proud
But when you leave town, they go around, they running they mouth
(Man)

They something like a hater man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon' see ya later, man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like what's going on, gwoin' to another song

'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy
(Get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school, you, fools

Schoolboys everywhere, we're Young Dude news
(Man)
St. Louis like Blues, D. Miles and Larry Hughes
And the Young Dude done paid, young dudes', dues, dude

But yo, what da hook gon be
(Uh oh!)
See, I don't need no fucking hook on this beat
(Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'ma rip

But yo, what da hook gon be
(Uh oh!)
See, I don't need no fucking hook on this beat
(Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'ma rip

The sun'll come out tomorrow
And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town Limousines

Plus, we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for 'Country Grammar' to sell
Ha ha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus, I like my Booties and my Boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be

I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit me
Close your ears, ma, you ain't heard nothin'
(Whaa?)
I always pay, ma, let a brother hold somethin'

I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons
(We all, we got!)
Used to be creative on Halloween
(How you gon'?)
Stop, a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

But yo, what da hook gon be
(Uh oh!)
See, I don't need no fucking hook on this beat
(Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'ma rip

But yo, what da hook gon be
(Uh oh!)
See, I don't need no fucking hook on this beat
(Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'ma rip

People always saying, "Man, it must be nice"
No hi, no nothing not a simple house life
Understand, the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no 'inch' and be expecting the 'foot'
Unless you want a foot
(Whoo!)

I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me, playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it but me, I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood

Catch me on, you're local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew
Let the girls do me while you do you

And um, all I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit these verses
That I'm usually slanging, I be ripping, man

But yo, what da hook gon be
(Uh oh!)
See, I don't need no fucking hook on this beat
(Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'ma rip

But yo, what da hook gon be
(Uh oh!)
See, I don't need no fucking hook on this beat
(Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'ma rip

But yo, what da hook gon be
(Uh oh!)
See, I don't need no fucking hook on this beat
(Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'ma rip
