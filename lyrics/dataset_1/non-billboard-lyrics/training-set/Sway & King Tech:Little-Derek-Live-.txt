Little Derek's Doing Okay (yeah)
Little Derek's Doing Fine (fine)
Little Derek's Doing Cool (cool)
You know how we do

Stepped out my house i'm feelin fresh and brand new
Olu did the trimry and I done the hairdo
And everything i wear's new, Mahadashi jacket, Puma top, boxfresh jeans and Nike cam boots.
Sprayed a little versace dreamer on me too
so every girl who pass is like ooh wooh
Police don't pull us over like woo woo
cos they're kids watch MTV and Channel U (U)

But life ain't always been fine like baby blue
cuz when u do UK rap you're number two
cuz the USA ain't givin us space to break true
so i'm on the grind tryin to pioneer a break-through
gotta keep the punters happy, to tango it takes two
and it seems like i'm the rapper the people take to
i've never had alot, with what i've got i've made do
now i'm blowin up up in this bitch like move, move, move!

Step out the ride i'm feelin nice and quite fly
I'm tryin to reach the top i see the top is quite high!
Steady on my grind tryin to get my face up in the source
so i keep my faith up in the forces in the bright, white sky
gettin calls from these record label bosses like 'Hi'!
head up in inside their offices
and listen to their promises
but no-ones made me offers yet
that I could not deny
And i been makin profits of this my mix-tapes raw
life ain't always been pretty like nah
on the north side of the city
where it's gritty like pie
we did what we had to done to get by
hopin not to get caught up in no silly drive by
little derek wrote lyrics while the others got high
and he ended up in HMV instead of HMP
cos street life could only end one way
your friend cryin on the scene like why, why, why?

3: Baby Blue

Knowin real fame that's what i used to dream about
that everyone would know my name and they would scream it out
knowin my song words and sing along to it now
and i would walk down the street and hear blue, blue, blue.
my video's rotatin so i got these execs debating
about whether i'm takin
and these RnB guys is thinking the same thing
calling up my phone asking whether i'm dating.
I turned my passion to career how could i lose out
quit my 9-5 so i don't have to sell shows now
my CDs are moving
that's the route that I'm choosing
so i got to make it thru, thru, thru
little Rachael used to look up to the sky too
analyse the planets and wonder if i could shine too
so now they ask how i'm doin i say
little Rachael's doing okay
