Man-from-Mars:Tony Matterhorn
Matterhorn again, so weh dem a seh?

I don't know, I guess you'll never know

Hey! Now I will attack them like I'm from another world
Everytime them see me rollin with another girl
Yes my hair is ever loud never Jherri Curl
I'm the ba ba ba ba black sheep yes I am the better pearl
Tell me bout my visa they be fuckin with my life
Yes alot of ladies round the world wanna be my wife
Now they see me never stoppin will they ever learn
That Matterhorn is hear and the king has return

So mi seh what you gonna do to stop the sunshine
What you gonna try to take what is mine

What you gonna say the day is so long
When your gonna learn that I am the man
The man from Mars is here

Mister from another planet I'm not here to stay
Now I'm here to do some songs and then I run away
You can never stop me than it's better you to say
Leave him the fuck alone, oh yeah
I'm here to do my work until my work is done
Then I'm gonna sail back in my ship towards the sun
Go into the planet where my people have some fun
Rom pa pa pom pom pom here I come

So what you gonna do to stop the sunshine
What you gonna try to take what is mine
What you gonna say your waistin my time
The man from mars is here

What you gonna say the day is so long
When your gonna learn that I am the man
The man from Mars is here
