The Mission
My style cap to the bible rap to the title track 
I got It locked and aim like a rifle master 
After the nine double I need therapy cause my mind struggles 
I search but all I can find Is trouble 
With my big eye open when I roll with a flow 
It's just like magnifico 
Though my creations are felt and got occupational wealth 
Still wicked as satan's health 
It's ok for your health take a journey today 
You'll learn the rules If ya please let me play with your mind 
I make ya feel divine when I unravel a rhyme 
That's gonna make you travel through time 
You wanna get high I'll take you to the bottom of the sky 
Pass the galax I hypno's gonna teach you to fly 
Close your eye then close your other eye 
Now In a flash you on another ride to the other side 

Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission 
Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission 

I want wisdom but wisdom's only friend Is time 
Who I I run away from 
But he always catches me and walks faster than I ran 
Time always gets his way 
An uninvited guest who spends more than just one day 
Told me the only way that I can meet wise 
Is If he brought his friend mistake 

Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission 
Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission 

Y'all know I'm movin' like a current through the socket I shock 'em 
Put me on the stereo here we go spritiual I sock 'em 
From the top to the bottom ya know what I got 'em 
I load the mic up with heat lock It cock It and rock 'em 
Cause here I come travelin' searchin' for wisdom 
Hittin' another plane that's In between the drum 
So journey with me I think you'll find when your done 
Spooks raisin' up the caliber out shinin' the sun 

My control raps speak the truth like phone taps 
I know you wanna express yourself blow that 
Cause my dispersement of searches remain stable and pertinent 
When I'm hurtin' It the verbal philosophy resembles socrates 
Now who the fuck wanna rock with me 
My approach Is thunderous like giants with knockin' knees 
And then I'm on a mission for bad karma that blister my balls 
Ga ga got 'em from behind his pigeon door 

Time always gets his way 
An uninvited guest who spends more than just one day 
Told me the only way that I can meet wise 
Is If he brought his friend mistake 

Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission 
Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission 
Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission 
Travelin' searchin' for wisdom the mission
