One-Squad:Waka Flocka Flame
[Verse 1]
I said my necklace iced out, my left wrist iced out
Waka Flocka Flame stay out my lane because I'm thugged out
Niggas getting drugged out, you know what my clique bout
Hit em wit a bottle stomp his motherfucking lights out
Hands on deck make a nigga pull a tool out
Balling this year
I ain't gonna stop until I fall out
Wild out wild out, Gudda Gudda wild out
Wild out wild out, Waka Flocka wild out

[Refrain]
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad

[Bridge]
Waka Flocka get jumped in the club
Gudda, Waka Flocka

[Verse 2]
For the cash I'll wrap a nigga ass up
Run up in his house Jim Carrey-style masked up
We the new Wu-Tang, the new No Limit
The new NWA, what's up Snoop and Dre
Can't forget Eazy-E, Ice Cube's on my neck
Fozzy screaming waka waka bitch I got that check
I don't need no flex but I gotta ball
Money Yao Ming, yes it's that tall
But I'm gutta, gutta
What's up Gudda Gudda
I got rotten apple blood in my veins
I reversed the slave route
I'm from up north to down south
No more mean mugs at my show sshowing green love
Green flags, green love
Su-woo to the people

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money nigga
I'mma rep to the death
You can see the YM tatted on my neck
All my niggas wild choppas on deck
Stomp a nigga out, demand I respect
Me and Waka Flacka got the hand on the tec
And it's cash on delivery so hand me my check
Nigga I don't talk much but when I do bitch pay me
Big money heavy weight, you can ask Baby
Birdman schooled me, Wayne told me do me
And stack big paper up, no need for loose leaf
My rubberband stacks can't fold into knots
I decapitate the top with two hoes in the drop
I'm countin up the money 'til my hands get blisters
Told my bitch to come help me, we can count it up quicker nigga
Real nigga music they talkin we do's it
Free my nigga Weezy and free my nigga Gucci
