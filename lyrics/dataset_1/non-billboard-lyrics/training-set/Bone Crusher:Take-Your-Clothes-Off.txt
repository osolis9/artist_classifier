With the bitches in the club getting naked for cheese
Like a good Sunday night up in Jazzy-T
Make the pussy breath the game Bone Crusher and me
You were mad 'cuz we were drinkin' that's what we came to see

Did we make you hang low, bitch, I love that?
'Cuz there ain't nothin' wrong with a good shake at
I love that, now do your thang, baby
Make your in, now, run a long and let me holler at your friends

Shake it like a motherfucker, move it like a vibrator
Shorty kinda a sweet and they shook her like annihilator
Popo with their bed breakers, all they got their bread makin'
Alcohol with this fish brining mo makin' all I need is new shoes

'Cuz he about to start a screw
Momma gotta work gotta do what she gotta do
Beat up the dude, she was down under love the rent man
So she went to work at Nintendo
