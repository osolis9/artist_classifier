Punish-Me:Big Pun
feat. Miss Jones

[Verse 1]
I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than giving birth
My first verse explains some of the games she was playing
I'm blaming myself cause in my wealth was where her pain would haven
Behaving like a money-hungry hooker, funny how the money took her
From a average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss
And smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ'
She got too big for her britches but The Bridge is Over
Not the one in Queens, I mean the one she dreaming wasn't sober
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fucking belt
I felt stupid Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Shoulda drowned you when I found you crushing in my boy's Camaro
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor, you ain't shit like my mother said

[Hook: Miss Jones]
Come back come back come back come back to me, Punisher
Punish me, I've been so bad, so bad
Won't you come back

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
Nah baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it, you blew it
Threw it all the way cause you was stupid -- girl why'd you do it
I mighta knew it by the way you gave me your baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
It's hard maybe we can make amends, be friends
But we're only hurting all of us for certain by forsakin him
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe
The way you were, preserved, these words so you won't play the herb
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother
I honor my word on my father's grave, guide him through his hardest age
So he can thrive and survive in these modern days
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resisting
I'm insistin you chill for real before you come up missing
Listen, I don't wanna fight I'd rather do what's right
A boy needs a father that's the most important part of his life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Punisher]
I gave you everything, love letters and sweaters with leather seams
Feathered wings and rings with emeralds right out of Geraldine's
Several dreams of cream fulfilled, the green Deville Cadillac
To mack matter fact weâ€™re deemed to bill
I mean for real I can play it mami how you wanna stay
Armani fresh, giving the next nigga my punani
You want me back cause he hit it wrong, now you wanna get it on
With the Long Don, word is bond my shit is strong, come back
Girl don't even start again, I beg your pardon
And get your hands off my six-button Cardigan
This ain't no love lost between us far as I'm concerned
Please leave, cut that busted weave I've been dying to burn
Go buy a perm, try and earn some respect
It's better to have loved and lost than live with regret

[Hook]
