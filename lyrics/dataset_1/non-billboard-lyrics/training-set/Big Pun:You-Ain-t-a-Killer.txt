You-Ain-t-a-Killer:Big Pun
Produced By Younglord


[Verse 1]
The harsh realities of life are taking toll
Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me what price to pay to make it home
Take control, I'm making dough but not enough to blow
JO's, they lust my flows, but ayo, I don't trust a soul
That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you
Halfway and eat you alive trying to survive illegal
I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
Whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
Then I'll stomp your corpse
It's the Bronx of course, recognize the accent
One of the last living still-in-action general assassins
Catching any wreck, blasting any TEC, smashing any chest
Passing any test; Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker?
Sow what you reap or wake up
Shaking up a storm, like Anita Baker
I'll take you straight to Hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate
Make no mistake, this shit as real as Joe
We follow the killer's code
When we come for you, tell me: Where will you go?
Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you
And and silence your screams
And even if you kill me, I'll still be in your fucking dreams

[Hook]
You ain't a killer, you still learning how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

[Verse 2]
You've made a grave mistake
Shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
Your brains'll make their debut on the table
When I raise the stakes
The pain is great, but only for a second
It starts strong then lessens
Just when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with so much stress (T.S.)
Blessed him with no regrets, yes
Welcome to Hell, son – the threshold of death
Face the serpent, I blaze your person, you get laced for certain
Leaving Jakes no trace to work from
Close the case, like curtains
I'm hurting heads severely, really trying to bring the pain
There's nothing more satisfying
Than when you crying, screaming my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods of bloodstains
Big Pun's my thug's name
Busting my guns, that's my love thang
I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple
John Madden-tackle your corpse
To hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst
Then curse tu vida, like a Brujería verse
I'm worse than anything you ever been through
Sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhyming abomination

[Verse 3]
It's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
We recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
D's in undercover cars
Taking my picture like I'm a fucking star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
With half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats, first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini-shottie, I'll body a nigga for a penny probly
I'm obligated to anything if it's crime related
If it shine, I'll take it; still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last edition
Properly a stash magician
Could've went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game
Now I'm strictly out for cream
Doing things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the Heaven's kings
Down to the Devil's mezzanine
I've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest
One that survive, it's who's the wisest
