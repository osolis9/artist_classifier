Somebody-Loves-You-:Plies
Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh
Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh
Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh

Wish I can hug every nigga who done lost trial
And see all da ones who ain't been visited in a while
And see all da goons dats down, wish I can help â€~em smile
To show all my niggas I love â€~em I'll walk a 100 miles

Bless my dawg who got killed in his own house
Help â€~em pull through if dey on life support now
Da only thing I live for is to make my son proud
My heart go out to all dese young niggas dat's runnin' wild

I said a prayer for all da mamas who done lost dey child
Da 12 year old who wanna fuck, God slow her down
Her life all of jammers help her to turn around
Please reach out and help her God before she frown

Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh
Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh

I know dat feeling when it feel like nobody care
When you goin' through yo problems, seem like nobody there
I started to question myself if God really care
Sometime I cut off all da lights in da room and stare

Wonder if he brought this far to drop me off here
I know it seem like sometimes life ain't fair
They say da only thing you count on in dis world is prayer
I prayed so much dat I thought dat God couldn't hear

'Cause I done been through so much bullshit dis past year
It's hard now to find motherfuckas dat's sincere
Da streets make so hard for you to think clear
I'd give up all dis shit to have my brother here

Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh
Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh

I got a call form my home girl, her mama died
Somebody home invaded took her mama life
I just held da phone and listen to her cry
She kept repeating herself, all she asked is why

Can only imagine what she goin' through on da inside
'Cause when my brother went to prison half of me died
Ain't nothin' more precious in da world homie than life
Gotta take da good wit da bad homie and stride

Da right amount of pressure can make you commit suicide
Imagine da pressure on a nigga who can't provide
When everything goin wrong it's hard to do right
If you goin' through right now all I wanna say is

Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh
Somebody loves you baby, oh, oh, oh
Somebody loves you baby, ooh
