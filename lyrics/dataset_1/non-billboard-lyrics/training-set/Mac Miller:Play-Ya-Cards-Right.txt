Play-Ya-Cards-Right:Mac Miller
uh yeah, little old school shit
so she came up to me and asked my name
i said it's funky mac i don't play no games
if you wanna come home with me tonight
you better play ya cards right.

i came to rock right now
i'm the best and i came to get down
i've been known to rock a microphone
she got a boyfriend but left him home
see i got style, so yes i brag
the things i do just make them mad
download new kicks to my ipad
why ya girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag
you a fad, this is forever, ladies in love with my agenda
my names something these girls remember
she write hers down, return to sender
i don't need it, thinking she can keep her secrets
one night only that's how i treat this
sleep in?
bitch please make me some breakfast
and then leave.
