My baby mama brother came and told me some shit
About a nigga talking about Pimp C ya wig'll get
Split
I laughed then I dashed cause I'm fucking your chick
She told me all she wanna do is ride my dick
She kick it with the nigga cause he give her the
Stacks
But every fucking night I try to break her fucking
Back
And now a nigga say that he wanna fight
But if you fucking around I'll put that fire in his
Life

(Bun B)
Man keep fucking it raw
And if he's trip then it's on
Never let a nigga say you a broad prove him wrong
Fool, I'm fucking this nigga girl now and he know it
Got a pistol but wont blow it, talking shit but wont
Show it
Yo it ain't nothing going on but nuts on they tricks
They never faking licks, sucking dick while I'm taking
Shits
I do a bitch bad and treat a nigga worse than that
And make sure you show him that fat gat you left wet
For him fool

I went to my nigga got that liquor dark
My nigga 3-2 came down with the water
A dip, dip, nigga trip, trip ya fried
I took my fucking pistol and shot a dopey in his eye
I ain't got no love for you fucking hos
I'm hot from smoking click, gotcha drippin on my
Fucking clothes
I got that fire bumpin in my brain
I'm thinking to myself, I need to go to selling caine
And all the time I'm bumpin W.C.
Cause it seem like he the only nigga making sense to
Me
And the shit ain't really the same
It's moving too fast, I just switched all of my aim
I'm rollin' in a raggedy ride, thinking about suicide
Puffing the green outside, nigga
And all the time I'm fried
I left it wet for ya nigga

I never loved a punk ass, sorry son of a bitch
Which is why I can't lie about the hate I said it
Straight
And never switched up my opinion, if you ain't down,
You ain't down
That's that, just go get your gat little bitch
Holla back when your pistol pack
I promise anybody trying to be a bold bastard
Getting fried like that dip, I'm full of that dank and
Ready to trip
It's been a lot of niggaz swearing that they hard
Like I care and I be sharing slugs with some of them
Studs
And some of their barin, darin
Hoes and half playas, and hit the blunt and give it
Away
And see which one these niggaz wont be living today
Hey what's up? Got me a cup of that irk and jerk
Putting in work until I'm blown and never the 5-4
Bitch
Cause I'm too cold, I expose like a bomb dropping them
Daily
So don't say we never told ya, how a trill nigga fold
Ya
Texas trilla O big baby, maybe you didn't know I gets
My blast on
And let loose some of this stress, leaving blood all
Over your chest
Yes, I left it wet for ya fool
