Apologize:Slim
I feel like I'm stuck, somewhat in a rut
If no one to care for me
I've been in this house, don't wanna leave out
And it's been several weeks

The couples that I see while I'm watching TV
Tells me what it used to be
Friends say move on but damnit they're wrong
And I just need you to know

I was on an ego trip but I changed since
Never meant for you to get away
I was listenin' to friends, baby, never again
I never meant the things I said

If you want me to apologize, I will
Anything you want me to, I'd do it all for you
I'm sorry 'cause I broke you down
Made you cry, girl, I apologize

Started throwing out your things to erase the memory
But it didn't work at all
Seeing our pictures in the frame, it's driving me insane
When I picked up the phone and call

Girl, you are a crucial part in my life
And I just won't accept this goodbye
I know I got one shot but girl, you mean a lot to me
And I can't let you leave

I was on an ego trip but I changed since
Never meant for you to get away
I was listenin' to friends, baby, never again
I never meant the things I said

If you want me to apologize, I will
Anything you want me to, I'd do it all for you
I'm sorry 'cause I broke you down
And made you cry, girl, I apologize

Girl, you mean the world to me
And you are like the air that I breathe, yes, you are
And now that you're gone
I can't move on and end it like this
Hey girl, I need you right here by my side
Just can make out and I

I was on an ego trip but I changed since
Never meant for you to get away
I was listenin' to friends, baby, never again
I never meant the things I said

If you want me to apologize, I will
Anything you want me to, I'd do it all for you
I'm sorry 'cause I broke you down
Made you cry, girl, I apologize

If I could rewind time
If I could take back the lies
If I could rewrite time
If I could take back the lies

Baby, I love you
