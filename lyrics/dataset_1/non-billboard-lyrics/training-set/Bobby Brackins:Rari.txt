A town where we start off the night
So I don't give a fuck, if you're mad at me'!
'my whips from oppression of a belly
Big body wet, you gonna see when I'm coming.

Even hits the bitches, be getting exciting
Now go play stupid, it gets me in trouble
'too long, now I can't be'
This is for the' that's niggas in the'
It's the same for no riders, the same for no snitches
Can't fuck with no snitches, alright, they get stitches
Faded in the rari, baby get my dick kisses.
