Dime-Piece-feat-Russell-Lee-:Baby Bash
Oh, yeah
Baby, I don't get down like that

Lady, you're a dime piece
And you lookin' so sweet
But baby, I don't work it like that

Who be paying for your jewels
But baby, I don't work it like that

No reezy, oh yeah, you fine
And you got that supa dupa
With the big ol' behind

You're a dime, you're a ten and a half, you so throwed
But you better check credentials, baby girl, I'm so cold on top
The girl got degrees in computers off top
But she still gold diggin', workin' at Hooters, I ain't no peanut

So you can't put no salt in my game
You know how the Chico do, I ain't gots to explain
Baby boo, on tha cool
You diggin' on me, I'm diggin' on you

We can have, our rendezvous
And marinate in a hotel room
Dinner and a movie, it's all groovy, I ain't trippin'
But you better stick with them bald players
'Bout all them trickin' though

Baby, you watchin' too many videos
Hangin' with them silly hoes
Got you where your fenced to go

Out the door, so fast, so quick
Even though you so yummy, you
Uh, you so thick, uh, uh

I got rules and regulations and guidelines
I'm in the game, you must wanna suck up from the sidelines
I ride for muscle, where I am 'bout to have near hundred
Actin' funny, tryin' push up on a hustle money

Even though I want ya, I really doesn't need ya
I guess you got to play the field
To appreciate the way I please ya
And don't confuse me for a ca, ah, captain save A
