As-I-Am:Logic
I know what it's like
To be all, all depressed
And not wanna go out and
And live life and
That's not healthy man
You can't be living like that what's wrong with you?

Hi
Yeah hey you, yeah you
Yea yea uh huh
I know you been feeling down
There's something's pissin you off
And something's wrong- you know what
We're gonna, I'm gonna cheer you up
I'm gonna help you out
Just go ahead and just
And just listen alright?
Here we go

Hi there hey friend how are you
Cheer on up you superstar you
Don't let them try you
Fuck that shit
Don't let them deny you
Cause you're gonna make it some day
And you're gonna make it some way
No more waitin for the bus
And no more riding on the subway
Live life how you want to
So get on up now go get out there
Face your fears
No need to be scared
You better rebel
And if they hate you give 'em hell
No more hiding in your sheeeeell
Cause we are not defined
By how hard we fall
So dust yourself off and stand tall
Cuz you can make it
Of this im sure
Just spread your wings
And you will soar

I know
I know, know
That I'm gonna blow
You away
And when I wake up
I'm gonna shake up
The fuckin' world
And you're gonna love me
You're gonna take me
As I am (as I am)
And not a single one of you
Can tell me no
Ohhhh yea

I'mma go where nobody before me has gone
And I know that the journey is gonna be long
Livin' life like a mademan like a don
I was in the dark but now with the lights on
It's real hard on the rise to fame
Cause everybody's mad and you're the one to blame
And just last year you didn't know my name - Logic
Now they all demand it
Used to hate me and I can't stand it
Cuz now you love me you so damn manic
Said I'll never make it said I'll fail
My shit was simple
Motherfucker I sell
I know I'm gonna prevail
Eyes on the prize right on my trail
Middle finger to the haters that are on my tail
Cause I got heart boy I got spunk
Feelin' just like Jordan before the dunk
And if you fuck around I'mma put you in the trunk
*Ha* I'm just playin around
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Wait for the sound (wait for the sound)
Oooowwwwww

I know
I know know
That I'm gonna blow
You away
And when I wake up
I'm gonna shake up
The fuckin' world
And you're gonna love me
You're gonna take me
As I am (as I am)
And not a single one of you
Can tell me no
Ohhhhh yeaaa

I swear to God that I love the life I live
And I'm grateful for every breathe it gives
I remember thinkin' something's got to give
New day but it all just feels the same
No clouds but I can feel the rain
Pointin' fingers lookin' for someone to blame (lookin' for someone to blame)
'Til I came across my own name
I wasn't in control of my destiny
Feelin' empty thinkin where's the rest of me
I gotta make it but I need the recipe
Only then will I find the best of me
I didn't wanna listen, didn't give a fuck
I was so selfish, I was so stuck
Cleanin up food, for a little buck
Then I quit that, livin' on luck
I was so lost, at what cost
Why be the worker, when you could be the boss
Still doin' wrong, trynna live right
Get my mind righteous, man I wanna fight
Shit gettin tight, man that ain't right
And my girl left, so I just might
So I just might
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
Happiness last, and uh
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa(ss)
Go home to where the, wild things roam, and uh
Happiness last, and uh
Haters kiss my aaaaaaaaaaaa(ss)
