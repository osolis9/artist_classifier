Embrace-the-Martian-Round-Table-Knights-remix-:Kid Cudi
Yea, When you meet me, when you see me
You know how to holla. You know

Ixnay on the bullshit mayne
When I roll back to Cleveland, cant believe it
Sounds of the nonbelievers
outcast til I’m in dirt, before it did hurt
Now I can understand how
You can dismiss or front on
Ask me how I, feel about them ones with closed eyes
My words how I feel exactly are fuck that
I don’t give a damn bout nan one hater
Talking down, don’t be afraid at all ya’ll
All I ask of all ya’ll is to please

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace, but I need ya’ll rockin wit me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

See I must tell you all now, keep on actin funny
Who am me? I am here to change that
How ya thinking often, and its startin
I am here to show you, how it feels to be new
Look at what I made you, guide to teach you
Honest, but insecure, cool
And you are fooled
Boutta have it heavy in my
Malarkey mixed wit garbage
I am here dawg, don’t be afraid at all ya’ll
All I ask of all ya’ll is to please

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace, but I need ya’ll rockin wit me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds
Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace, but I need ya’ll rockin wit me
Please, embrace the martian

Licensed to ill
I promise I won’t turn the whole world to Cloverfield
On the real, yea I will. I’ll destroy it and then rebuild
Just for thrills, sometimes you got to do it
Sometimes to show the tough love
No one is above, what you are hearin now dude
No matter who else included, I’m saluted
I’m saluted
No matter who else included, I’m saluted
I’m zooted
Oh, whether you appeal or not
This is the real
Real recognize real
You. You are me
Like it or not and I
I am you oo oo

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace, but I need ya’ll rockin wit me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

Embrace the martian, embrace the martian
I come in peace, but I need ya’ll rockin wit me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds


Oo oo, and this is how it sounds
In my mind, ooo
