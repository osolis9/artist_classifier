That boy that love to rock
Man, I hold more songs then a goddamn jukebox
That nigga like 2 Pac, 130 songs in one day
Don't stop that boy gone hurt somethin'
Make him sit there watchin' numbers
(Hey)

5, 10, 15, as my money keep pillin' up
Had to get another money machine
'Cause the first one I had don't work no more
Had to get me some new cars with new rims and chrome
Bars, I'm kinda glad they made stereos
Wit' a button in the middle

I miss my aunt aunt like miss my grandma
Wit' a Crisco can on the back of the stove
'Bout to fry me up some cat fish with a side of okra
Y'all ready to have some fun

(Yeah)
Helicopter want to back it, back it up
(Yeah)
I got that what they want
(Yeah)

They want that bumpty, bumpty
(Yeah)

But dog this shit here cold

Big bird gotta new flock that wanna fly south
Soarin' to the next block
You bed not park in the place
Where the sign says ain't no park

Gonna make me come outside
And have to lay down my sox, call Snoop Dogg
(Snoop Dogg)
Do it wit three girls on the side
Hard nox crank the nine

With a Carolina baseball cap pulled down
So the sun don't go in my eyes
We that type of guy, the guys that daddy don't like
With that old cologne that they used to wear

Comin' in here, smellin' just like
My head is towards the light
Make sure the apples ripe
Just wait the day, I then pulled mine down
And nigga just bite me

What you doin' in there with the lights off
You get in this living room right now
I wish he take his ass to a motherfuckin' bingo session
He's just mad 'cause mine's is bad
And he forgot where he put his Viagra
(Hey)

Now what am I gone do with all these girls
(Hey)

Hoochie, coochie, yaya fool
Put yo hands on the back of that stool
Uh, uh, you bed not move
Stop actin' like this is something your used to

I've known you since high school
When they caught you in the gym
Behind the bleachers with a Jewish dude
Yo name rung bells in the neighborhood

Best head in the whole wide world
Prettiest chest they ever gave to a woman
It almost hates to make a nigga stay still
I bet you'd ask in a fast time

Hate to ask to make a nigga get krunk
Some place were you ain't supposed to be drunk
Get tapped on till yo lil' thang get drunk

And you face swell up like it was busted open
I told you this bop gotta whole lotta bump
Now get on outta here
(Who am I?)

Meet me in the boy's bathroom

Meet me in the boy's bathroom
(I said, I said, I said)

Meet me in the boy's bathroom
(I said, I said, I said)
Now what am I gone do with all these girls?
(Hey)
