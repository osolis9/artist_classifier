I don't need no receipts
I see it, I own it, I play for keeps
Don't tell me the price, don't matter to me
What I spend in a day, you make in a week
They keep going up like a money tree
Shop in these deals like a money spree
Can't give you the gang, gotta charge a fee
Queen of rack city, give me the key
I be like "Send me the addy"
Hop out the Porsche with a baddie
Got a nice face and a fattie
Do what I say like I'm daddy
Been out here killin' em
Yeah, this chain cost 'bout a million
Told y'all make me 'bout a billion
Yeah, we see who outchea, really am
Look, I don't got no curb, I got mileage
I'm always on the jet like a pilot (you can't afford this life)
Ace of diamonds move, yeah, I'm throwin'
Money fallin' to the floor like it's snowin'
