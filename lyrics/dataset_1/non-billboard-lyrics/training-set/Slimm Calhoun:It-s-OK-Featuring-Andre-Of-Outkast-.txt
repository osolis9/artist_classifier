All these lonely girls
Wanna fuck, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK

Keep callin' me and beggin'
Me and blowin' me up, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK, it's OK

My game, slicker than slow tongue
Get yo' main hoe sprung
Chokin' on my blowgun
She swallowed all my bubble gum

Said it was so yum, yum
All off in her tum, tum
Playboy, you think dumb, dumb
Now what? Uh huh

Last night, I was in them guts, uh huh
A young playa cuts yo' what? Uh huh
She was just tryin' to get a nut, uh huh
And we gon' meet back at the hut, uh huh, come on

All these lonely girls
Wanna fuck, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK

Keep callin' me and beggin'
Me and blowin' me up, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK, it's OK

A-town, late nights
[Incomprehensible] in 112, posted up as usual downstairs
With a couple of clydesdales, sippin' zippindale
Got a sack of good, take a whiff, inhale

Blaze up, hate to ball and bail
Got some late cut, she sure now how to shake her tail
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up
And leave her man, make up

And cheat again, caked her
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Next week she said she'll bring a friend, come on

All these lonely girls
Wanna fuck, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK

Keep callin' me and beggin'
Me and blowin' me up, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK, it's OK

Said, I love my man, man, man, man we got our ups and downs
And I'll get lonely and, and, and, and
Wanna move, move to someone who might
Understand, stand, stand, stand how to make a girl feel
Like Alice in Wonderland, Wonderland, Wonderland, wanderin'

If she can home with guilt on her mind
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine
After they do better, better tell her, 'fo another fella
Better, get, sit sit, shit shit, spit spit, hit hit

All these lonely girls
Wanna fuck, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK

Keep callin' me and beggin'
Me and blowin' me up, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK

All these lonely girls
Wanna fuck, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK

Keep callin' me and beggin'
Me and blowin' me up, it's OK
That's alright, girl, that's OK
