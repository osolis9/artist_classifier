The Cash
[hook: [steele] (tek)]
We control the nut (who's comin in?)
What they comin wit? (what they movin in?)
Who's movin in? (when can i expect my payment)
Refuse and choose to brave men (yo grave will be under this pavement)
Concrete burial, war for you, for all of you
(win or lose, you still lose and that's the rules)
The respect i get is just a reflection of my status
(top ranking never catch a smokin in a bandage)
About the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the dough)

Outside (postered up, a mr. pool in my thugs)
It's bug the ones who hold heat is the way they show love
(while the drug kingpin, showed his way to baguettes
And pressin looker birds, with his blue face lex
Throw on his wrist like he's flamin, peer door he be slayin
Broad like iced out, cardiar chain danglin)
I seen him minglin with the high rollers
Rollin high dollars, ballin wit more tricks than harlem globetrotters
Got a whole lotta soldiers to his dirty deeds for him
(shorty's the g form) little niggas movin keys for him
(the d's on) but couldn't touch him when they caught him
(cuz he support them) wit the same money that bought him

[chorus: tek (steele)]
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about big faces (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the paper (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about big faces

Aiyo sun, got a minute let me tell you about this one
This young sexy bunny, checkin money to hit somethin
I don't mean fuckin, the only cream she be likin
Is that green stuff that come and make her whole world function
Rebon capatone, love guns and roses, expesive clothes
With diamonds and niggas that holdin, then she foldin
Rockin panamanian gold, and ear ring,
Bracelet link change with 550 clothin

Young bird, an iceberg, slams ago e.s.
Here's press, a platinum rolly, 5 karat necklace
Gotta pay to sex it, she catch ya wallet when you sleepin naked
Throughbread for the dough, cuz she gotta make it
I help to take it, seven digit figure caper
So much paper, cop the lex, already laced her
From exquisite, faithful to a thug on jail visits
Have fun on the weekend, then it's back to business

[chorus: steele (tek)]
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the money)
It's all about the cash (still don't nuthin move but the dough)
