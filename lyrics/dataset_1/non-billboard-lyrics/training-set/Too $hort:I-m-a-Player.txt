You see I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage & a weddin' ring
I be a player for life. So where's my wife?
Probably at the rehab stuck at the pipe
'cause she must be smokin' & I'm not jokin'
Too $hort baby comin' straight from Oakland
Got way mo' bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
'cause I can give you a bitch who wouldn't give you joint
Bitches Ain't Shit & now I made my point
So you can light that weed
While I spit this rap
& tell you about a player from way back
I was only 14 when I first got my dick sucked
Now I'm grown up & I really like to bust nuts
Gittin' freaky in the right situations.
You wanna rap? Well that's a nice occupation
To get pussy when you want 'n' how you want it fool'
'cause I was fuckin' ugly hoes back in high school'
I used to fuck young ass hoes
Used to be broke & didn't have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tellin' stories 'bout rags to riches
About a pimp named $horty from the Oakland set
Been mackin' for years 'n' ain't fell of yet
So if you ever see me rollin' in my drop top caddy
Throw a peace sign & say "Hey pimp daddy!"
'cause I never would front' on my folks
I slow down & let the gold diggers count my spokes
Bitches come a dime a dozen
So don't get mad when I fuck your cousin
Your 2 sisters, I even fuck your ex-bitch
$hort Dog in the house with some player shit...

All the fake players peep game from the real
Player hatin' lover tell me how do you feel
When you front to the homies how you grind 'em
Look fo' a tramp, but you can't find 'em
You got 1 girlfriend & you see her every night
Comin' around the partners, lyin' about your life
Looked at your watch it said 6: 22
Cut to the house & said "Baby I love you"
Can't act like a mack like playboy $ho'
an' the rest of the macks in the streets of the O bitch!
Comin' up we learn how to "BREAK" these hoes
& when your through gettin' yours then you shake these hoes
& when your older, it's nothin' but a routine
Makin' G's everyday workin' blue jeans
I know I seen it before
I see it again
Young tender sayin' "$hort would you be my man...?"

Yeah there's alot of fake players out there
Talkin' bad about Ant Banks. You know what I'm sayin'?
But "I" ain't trippin' up.
$hort Dog. What you do about them player haters?

Try 'n' stay away from Kriss Kross imitators
Put you in a cross 'cause they really jus' haters
I thought you knew, $hort Dog is a player
Born to mack 'n' got bitches everywhere
I ride around town in my clean ass cars
Screenin' these hoes like movie stars
Checkin' my traps like a dirty rat
I was born to mack
I'm hookin' hoes like crack, I be a monkey on your back bitch
Until you kick that $hort Dog habit got you all on my dick
& even though I can't fuck you every day
"IT'S" 'cause I got another bitch around' the way
We can all get together on a late night
Cut to the house hook somethin' up real tight
I really don't care
'Cause I'm A Player...
