Yeah-Yeah-You-Would-Mixtape-:Diddy - Dirty Money
(feat. Grace Jones)

Ladies and gentlemen, yeah,
I'm here to tell you that this is a brand new sound
This (this) will change your lives
All you gotta do is turn your shit up, turn your shit up
(All you gotta do is turn your shit up)

This what you want, what you want
That's what you need, that's what you need
That's what you get, that's what you get
That's what you like, what you like
That's the Dirty Money

Could have been your everything,
Could have been your shooting star,
Could have been your backbone, but now I'm too far away
You won't be there alone,
My love wouldn't be over
We wouldn't be staring out the window,
Guessing which way the wind blows

You would be loving me, hold me, treating me better, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
You're just so damn selfish, man, and so jealous, you would be loving me, yeah you would,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would

Yeah, come on, oh
Who was your number one?
Who had niggas at the alter wearing fuchsia gators and cummerbunds?
Got my hand on my gun,
As I'm sitting drinking and thinking I love you, you should've had my son
Got me losing my mind,
All alone in my room, staring at your picture like I'm doing time
I know loving me's hard, loving me's hard,
But the further you are away, got me closer to God

Sex could've been greater,
If I was the only one, wouldn't be your mistress?
But now I'm too far to play (too far to play)
Now you take the blame along (you take the blame along),
Love won't be free to roam (love won't be free to roam)
We would be prisoners of the sheets, baby, I'll be your capture (I'll be your capture)

You would be loving me, hold me, treating me better, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
You're just so damn selfish, man, and so jealous, you would be loving me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you would

All I wanted was your loving, you kept telling me you wouldn't be happy
[â€¦]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you would
