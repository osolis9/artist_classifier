Jason-s-Addiction:A+
Pretty scary how they know you
It depends on who you talk to
From the end to the beginning
Only happy when we're singing

Smiling for the camera
Crazy silly monsters
They think everything is great
Black and white not colour
Eight by ten, no bigger
Not tonight it ain't...

You can try and put the face on
You can talk it but it goes wrong
You can put it in an album
Like the 90's never happened

Everything is easy,
But they don't believe me
I think I deserve a say
Beds are made for sharing
But I'm way past caring

Not tonight it ain't, Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't, Not tonight it ain't

Not tonight it ain't, Not tonight it ain't
Not tonight it ain't, Not tonight it ain't

Trying to remember,
Nothing lasts forever
Live before it gets too late
On the never ever
Pretty good together
Not tonight it ain't...
