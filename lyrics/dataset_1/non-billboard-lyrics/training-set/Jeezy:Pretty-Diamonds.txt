[Hook: Jeezy & Chris Brown]
You look better than some pretty diamonds
You look better than some pretty diamonds
You lookin' better than some pretty diamonds
Spendin' all my time and money
Girl just look where you at
All of them shoes and bags
Poppin' them tags, spendin' money on your ass
You lookin' better than some pretty diamonds
You look better than some pretty diamonds
You lookin' better than some pretty diamonds
Leave what you want, you know I ain't gotta lie
You know diamonds are a girl's best friend
[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Woke up to a bag I might just go and splurge today
Called this little baddy up, pulled up on the ondelay
She got that tight charisma, make the hardest nigga shy
I said she got that tight charisma, make the lamest nigga try
And you know she independent just like that Boosie song
When we bought the city out, we like to throw that Boosie on
Fuck that girl all on my safe, fuck that girl all in my Wraith
Even in the Caddy truck, I'm throwin' boxes on my waist
Bitch you know who you fuckin' with? Bitch it's Mr. Make It Happen
All these pretty jewels and shiny shit, I didn't get that rapid
Nigga anythin' and everythin' is sexy 'bout this broad
Look I gotta pace myself, can't bust too quick, so help me God

[Hook: Jeezy & Chris Brown]
She look better than some pretty diamonds
You look better than some pretty diamonds
You lookin' better than some pretty diamonds
Spendin' all my time and money
Girl just look where you at
All of them shoes and bags
Poppin' them tags, spendin' money on your ass
You lookin' better than some pretty diamonds
You look better than some pretty diamonds
You lookin' better than some pretty diamonds
Leave what you want, you know I ain't gotta lie
You know diamonds are a girl's best friend

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
The devil wears Prada and she be in that Louis too
You know her when you see her, she gon' be the coldest in the crew
Type to take your heart out and walk on it with red bottoms
Had a whole city talkin' 'bout, I think they ain't got 'em
She the type to say she ain't fuckin' on the first night
I'm the type of nigga have her naked at the first light
Call me Mr. Delta, yeah I put her on the first flight
Once I work the left and then I hit her with that first right
I'm in the zone if I say so myself
I put the game on, the cars I was there
Leave out the club then we go get a room
She leave when we done and I'm leavin' at noon
The sexiest thing 'bout her gotta be her confidence
And if I say I want it twice a week, then that's a compliment

On the road gettin' my money up
Ah, you thought that I wasn't man enough
Probably leave you, yeah
I gave you my love and you didn't, you didn't, you didn't
I know I, I know I threw this shit in your face
I was rippin' and runnin' them streets, I was havin' them babies
Never thought this could happen to me, God
Now my mind racin'
I never intended this to be, that was my last chance
I bought these diamonds just so you won't leave
