Afta-Hourz:All City
[J-Mega]
Corner clans, niggas post it deep on tha Ave.
Herbs be catching they bags, cuz they don't know the half
When brothers be strapped, seven out of ten wit murder raps
You test 'em black, ten ta one your ass'll get clapped
The city creepers, beast with badges, they always peep us
Chillin', they thinking villains is the only ones with beepers
Night cliques, bag enough chicks
Drinking brews and smokin' lye
Bustin off the shit just for kicks
Some play in the projects,
In front of my building, it's a reflex
Niggas who I check, is getting charged out my complex
It's like its one aim, and that is just maintain
Cuz now I'm in my twenties and shit is still the fucking same
Night games, I see low, ya know the steelo
Brothas be speaking, on ways ta purchase them a kilo
And flow, cuz in the daytime they won't allow us
To form or powers, there for we blossom afta hourz

The night time it is the right time (3X)
The Night time

[G.V]
Yo, whenever the sun sets, it's big money that we can get, and make
Yo, Stay awake and keep your eye out for the jake
In these city streets, wit cover-up cops walking the beat
And niggas be drawin' heat, trying to make the ends meet
But that's tha game, players with no aim be wettin'
And the first thing that comes to one's mind is settin'
And if the killer instinct is what'll make us extinct
I know niggas who rob ya blind quik before you can blink
You got crack addicts, who once was living lavish
Now resort to pullin' automatics, as a way of supporting habits
I gots ta have it, this c.r.e.a.m. is a young thug's dream
I'm out to murder those who try to intervene
With my cash flow, the aim's ta put the corner in the smash yo
And do it right, lock this shit down tight
Cuz it's all about money in this land of loot
Who got the biggest guns and ain't scared to shoot
Through the hard times, kid you gots ta do what's necessary
And not knowing, wether you live or die can be scary
That's why we come out armed with the bullet proof vests
With clips hidden in our kicks
And guns in our Guess
Yo, that's the evening wear, cuz out here you must prepare
This atmosphere's severe, afta hourz

Late night it's only right
We live for the twilight
Evening love niggas
