The-Upper-Room:Kid Cudi
(Verse 1)
This is important, yes
So please turn it up, real loud
I got a question and I need you to answer, now
If you walked in my shoes, would you survive?
If you said yea then I'mma call you a lie
You see, I don't believe you would
Most people are pussies
Scared to be what God had made them to be

[Hook]
There's someone way up in the sky look out for all of us
Yeaaaa mmhhmmm, in the upper room
I don't believe in miracles
I do believe in fate, I do believe in destiny

(Verse 2)
This is important, yes
So please turn it up, if you can
I have matured so much, the boy has became a man
Finally I can say, I'm feelin' proper
No need to worry, I'm a happy new me
Because I know
