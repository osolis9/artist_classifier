Priorities:Legend
Pennies for your thoughts. My dreams are always dead to me. I've
 always needed the push from my family. I'm making I never could keep.
 I'm looking back on everything that I thought I would need. How crazy
 it all seems to find what your life could always be. If you want it so
 bad, I'll show you what it means to me.

 I'm finding ways without ever starting. I'm always trying to find
 where I fit in their lives.

 Back and forth on top I'm always leaving things behind. I'm always
 finding out how to live life like a lie.

 I'm aways trying to find myself.
