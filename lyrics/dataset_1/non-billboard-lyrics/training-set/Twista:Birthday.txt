Celebrate, girl, nobody can compare with you
Birthday in January, so she a Aquarius
So they say, they say that pussy got miles like Darius
But she look better than most chicks in her area

Shorty don't wanna like me, she only like G
Only fucking with the thugs and the white T's
Birthday February, so I'm Pisces
It's the fish scales in long island ice teas

There right off from January's and February
Was a girl who was a Aries who always be smokin'
Berries had style show but her suff so hairy
Ass so fat, it rings canary
