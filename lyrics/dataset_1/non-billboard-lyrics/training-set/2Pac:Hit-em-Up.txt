Hit-em-Up:2Pac
[Tupac]
 I ain't got no motherfucking friends
 That's why I fucked your bitch
 You're fat motherfucker {Take Money}
 West Side
 Bad Boy Killers {Take Money}
 You know who the realist is
 niggas we bring it to {Take Money}
 (ha ha, that's alright)

 First off, fuck your bitch
 And the click you claim
 West side when we ride
 Come equipped with game
 You claim to be a player
 But I fucked your wife
 We bust on Bad Boys
 niggas fuck for Life
 Plus Puffy tryin' to see me weak
 Hearts I rip
 Biggie Smalls and Junior Mafia
 Some mark ass bitches
 We keep on coming
 While we running for your jewels
 Steady gunning
 Keep on busting at them fools
 You know the rules
 Little Ceasar go ask you homie
 How I'll leave you
 Cut your young ass up
 See you in pieces
 Now be deceased
 Little Kim,
 Don't fuck around with real G's
 Quick to snatch your ugly ass, off the streets
 So fuck peace
 I'll let them niggas know
 It's on for Life
 Don't let the west side
 Ride the night (ha ha)
 Bad Boys murdered on Wax and kill
 fuck with me
 And get your caps peeled
 You know, see

[Chorus:]
 Grab your glocks when you see 2pac
 Call the cops when you see 2pac, uh
 Who shot me,
 But your punks didn't finish
 Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
 nigga, I hit 'em up

 Check this out
 You motherfuckers know what time it is
 I don't know why I'm even on this track
 You all niggas ain't even on my level
 I'm going to let my little homies
 Ride on you
 bitch made ass Bad Boys bitches
 {ah yo, yo, hold the fuck up}

 Get out the way yo
 Get out the way yo
 Biggie Smalls just got dropped
 Little move pass the mac
 And let me hit 'em in his back
 Frank White needs to get spanked right
 For setting up traps
 Little accident murderers
 And I ain't never heard of you
 Poise less gats attack when I'm serving you
 Spank the shank
 Your whole style when I gank
 Guard your rank
 'cause I'm a slam your ass in a pang
 Puffy weaker than a fuckin' block
 I'm running through nigga
 And I'm smoking Junior Mafia
 In front of you nigga
 With the ready power
 Tucked in my Guess
 Under my Eddie Bauer
 Your clout petty sour
 I push packages ever hour
 I hit 'em up

[Chorus]

 Peep how we do it
 Keep it real
 Its penitentiary steel
 This ain't no freestyle battle
 All you niggas getting killed
 With your mouths open
 Tryin' to come up off of me
 You and the clouds hoping
 Smoking dope
 It's like a Sherm high
 niggas think they learned to fly
 But they burn motherfucker you deserve to die
 Talking about you Getting Money
 But it's funny to me
 All you niggas living bummy
 While you fucking with me?
 I'm a self made Millionaire
 Thug livin', out of prison
 Pistols in the Air {Air} (Ha Ha)
 Biggie remember when I use to let you sleep on the couch
 And beg the bitch to let you sleep in the house
 Now it's all about Versace
 You copied my style
 Five shots couldn't drop me
 I took it and smiled
 Now I'm back to set the record straight
 With my A-K
 I'm still the thug that you love to hate
 Mother-fucker I'll Hit 'Em Up

 I'm from N E W Jers.
 Where plenty of murder occurs
 No points to come
 We bring drama to all you herds
 Now go check the scenario
 Little Ceas'
 I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
 Coppin' please with these scenario
 Little Kim is you
 Coked up or doped up
 Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
 What the fuck?
 Is you stupid?
 I take money,
 crash and mash through Brooklyn
 With my click looting, shooting, and polluting your block
 With fifteen shot,
 Cocked glock to your knot
 Outlaw Mafia click moving up another notch
 And your Pop stars popped and get dropped and mopped
 And all your fake ass east coast props
 Brainstormed and locked

 You're a beat biter
 Pac style taker
 I'll tell you to face, you ain't nothing shit but a faker
 So fill the Alize with a chaser
 'bout to get murdered for the paper
 E.d.i I mean post the scene of the caper
 Like a loc, with little Ceas' in a choke (uh)
 Toting smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
 Thug Life, niggas better be known
 Be approaching
 In the wide open, gun smoking
 No need for hoping
 It's a battle lost
 I gottem crossed as soon as the funk is bopping off
 nigga, I hit 'em up

 Now you tell me who won
 I see them, they run (ha ha)
 They don't wanna see us
 Whole Junior Mafia click
 Dressing up trying to be us
 How the fuck they gonna be the Mob?
 When we always on out job
 We millionaire's
 Killing ain't fair
 But somebody got to do it

 Oh yah Mobb Deep (uh)
 You wanna fuck with us
 You Little young ass motherfuckers
 Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something
 You're fucking with me, nigga?
 You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart-attack
 You better back the fuck up
 Before you get smacked the fuck up
 This is how we do it on our side
 Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it,
 Bring it.
 But we ain't singing,
 We bringing drama
 fuck you and your mother fucking mama.
 We're gonna kill all you mother fuckers.
 Now when I came out, I told you it was just about biggie.
 Then everybody had to open their mouth with a mother fucking opinion
 Well this is how we gonna' do this:
 fuck Mobb Deep,
 fuck Biggie,
 fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a mother fucking crew.
 And if you want to be down with Bad Boy,
 Then fuck you too.
 Chino XL, fuck you too.
 All you mother fuckers,
 fuck you too.
 (take money, take money)
 All of y'all mother fuckers,
 fuck you, die slow motherfucker.
 My four four (.44 magnum) make sure all your kids don't grow.
 You motherfuckers can't be us or see us.
 We mother fuckin' Thug Life riders.
 West Side till' we die.
 Out here in California, nigga
 We warned ya'
 We'll bomb on you mother fuckers.
 We do our job.
 You think you the mob, nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob
 Ain't nothing but killers
 And the real niggas, all you motherfuckers feel us.

 You niggas laugh 'cause our staff got guns under they motherfuckin' belts
 You know how it is and we drop records they felt
 You niggas can't feel it

 We Bad Boy killers.
