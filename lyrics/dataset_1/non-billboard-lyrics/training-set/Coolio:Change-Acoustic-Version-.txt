Change-Acoustic-Version-:Coolio
Yeah...
Streets are still hard...
I still walk the yard...
My soul is still scar...

When darkness falls across my face
swept hoping tears upon my face
these times like this that i can't erase
this goes a being whip, chain, hand or mace
so i try to accept a high to feel the base
we concepts and dreams of a different places
but all that lies and life that i was taught
and all the good things that i forgot
that cold and then i avert, wipe a pussy like a savage
got an untight rip or love my bad habits
sometimes i faith to the fiend sometimes i laugh at it
get being on a project take a step at it
i don't med it by my static i don't need to be graphic
i steped to being mine and you go see achieve
cuz you don't even know what it into G
don't see the end of an A and the history

Припев
I want to change the world to real

This size at homily, it slowly breaking me down
I'm still the same inside my brain
And if i change, it might just break me down

These things inside i show but i cannot hide
and now i lost count of a times i tried
the times i lied about shit that with me with necessary
i changed my floor but my scar really never very
i feel like abyss sometimes i waited a vex i veil like a vessel
killed on my back and shoulders would be other soldier i told you
cuz i wake the hood like a big para fold you
who don't understand the meaning of the mystery
my baby be so wet clothes so don't you be
acting like a gangster cuz my bangers being
shitting on the block with that 23
mellow me derails that i set you free
so maybe you can see where i can't see
so we run about life shit cross bitches and gillish news
big changes amuse the bullshit we saw in the news

Припев
I want to change the world to real
This size at homily, it slowly breaking me down
I'm still the same inside my brain
And if i change, it might just break me down
