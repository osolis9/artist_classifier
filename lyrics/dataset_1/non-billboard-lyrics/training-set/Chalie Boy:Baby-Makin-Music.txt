Baby making music, I wanna to make love to you
Making love baby making music, baby making music, I wanna make love to you
That's only for mine, hey baby making lot of baby making music

Haters steady bugging me, questioning your love for me
I'm comfort in your love for me, forever shall be flooding me
Uh you know I'd love to see, you right now in front of me
I visualize I was goona be,
when I'm home and you're not at this phone with me
Doing something wrong with me, to show that you put off for me
If these eyes can only see what you're doing right now,, over me
Baby it's holding, your voice is holding me,,
I'm on the way home and I not gonna leave, until it's played on repeat, we get into the called the burden to please

Baby making music, I wanna make love to you
Making love baby making music, baby making music, I wanna make love to you
That's only for mine, hey baby making lot of baby making music

This is what you're wishing, lay back into the position
Close your eyes, no leave them open,
I want you to see and feel all of this emotion
Don't hold back just let it go, if you feel, any, let me know
loose yourself, you're starting to glow,
do it yourself, you can take control
go ahead, you can have it your way,
careful now, or you'll drive yourself crazy, and myself so fun, push me now, I'll show you how to,

Baby making music, I wanna make love to you

spin some songs of fucking silk I'll freak you till you're tired
Baby face and jon b have you singing like a choire
kenny g and rick james fuel your fire and desire,
mint condition got me staring in your pretty eyes
All the places I'll kiss you thanks to air and no surprise
Adina got me ready to show you my nasty grind
And jagged edge cant love you quite like I
Escape will tell you I'm the one who you can run to
Lay down tell me what's on your mind like shai girl I will comfort you
Can't let your beauty pass me by like Drew Hill
Come inside the secret garden, girl your love is too real
