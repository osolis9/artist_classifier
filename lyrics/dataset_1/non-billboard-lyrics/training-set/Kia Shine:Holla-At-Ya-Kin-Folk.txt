Holla-At-Ya-Kin-Folk:Kia Shine
I gotta be honest though and tell the truth
That why I talk on my records, that be why I talk on my records
Be like 'cause I got somethin' to say
And on this song right here I got somethin' to say
About them real women out there, y'knahmsayin'?
Ya heard me?

Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I know you be happy 'cause we made it past it
If you need somethin' just ask daddy, c'mon

When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain, that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothin'
If you ever need me, just holla at ya kinfolk

She came down South with me
Suffered through the drought with me
Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me
She went without with me, lost e'rythang she had
To get me back on my feet, she borrowed from her mom and dad

She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes
She sold her earrings, mayne, to get yo' boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our shit straight
My gal trill and for me, she'll do whatever it takes

She took a charge for me when I got caught with a gun and 'dro
At TSU homecomin' at the mass co
She on the grind with Shine, tryin' to come up on these figures
I'ma keep it trill, mayne
She realer than most of y'all [Incomprehensible]

Taught her stay down and you'll come up
That's how we live everyday where I'm from, brah
And mayne it's what she did, she know who she is
Anything I got, I'ma give, holla at ya kinfolk

Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I know you be happy 'cause we made it past it
If you need somethin' just ask daddy, c'mon

When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain, that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothin'
If you ever need me just holla at ya kinfolk

See you my inspiration, on top of that my motivation
I know you got my back, regardless of the situation
Girls don't even know you hate you
I know they get so aggravatin'
Yet you got so much patience
Dealin' with me and this dream I'm chasin'

I'm constantly on the road, I'm constantly on the move
You calmly handle the duties, things you thought you'd never do
Like livin' out hotels and messin' up your credit
It woulda broke a weaker gal but you ain't let it

Get the best of ya that's why I mess wit'chu
Went through God's test wit'chu, why I'm so blessed wit'chu
I must confess to you when I say that you the trillest
Compared to any other gal, yeah, you the realest

And mayne, you got to feel it, just like my heart's feelin'
Through this track when I be talkin' 'bout this hard livin'
It's like you was my witness, now you is my Mrs.
Anything you want you can get it, holla at ya kinfolk

Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I know you be happy 'cause we made it past it
If you need somethin' just ask daddy, c'mon

When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain, that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothin'
If you ever need me just holla at ya kinfolk

Ay, you know I ain't one of these dudes
Who too hard to say how he feel, y'knahmsayin'?
It don't cost nuttin' to keep it trill
You stay down there with me, you gon' get what's due to you
Whatever you need daddy got you, holla at ya kinfolk

Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I know you be happy 'cause we made it past it
If you need somethin' just ask daddy, c'mon

When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain, that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothin'
If you ever need me just holla at ya kinfolk
