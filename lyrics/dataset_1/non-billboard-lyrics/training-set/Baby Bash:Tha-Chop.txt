Tha-Chop:Baby Bash
This is aint nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to Chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it, now I gotta buy tha chop

(FIRSTVERSE)

I'm with my momma rant-a-car with ten and a half pounds
No DL's, an endless amount of rounds
With my mind on my mansion, I'm smashin about the town
You thought I was a hog? Wait till I clown now
Basha with me, believe me, disturbin three for the fifty
And I wish a mutha fucker would try to get with me
'cos I'm nifty with the milly when the torch is on
And Play every play like its fourth and long
Now when the horse is gone, I beat the shit out the pig
It dont take much, to split a fools wig
See im only one shot from making the headlines
So quick nigga, got quarters and dead lines
Shakin the bed time, they checking my barcode
A.T.F, I.N.S and the US Marshal
And this is aint nathin new to me
Capitalize on opportunity (Uh!)
And this is aint nathin new to me
Capitalize on opportunity
(Which way did he go?)
(Which way did he go?)
(Which way did he go?)

(CHORUS)

This is aint nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to Chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy tha chop
This is aint nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to Chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy tha chop

(SECOND VERSE)

This old shit aint new to me
I'm rockin stolen jewelry
Try to chill so I leave the bay
Did dirt with it now I gotta keep the K
Bash a dude's wig over baby bash
He my smokin nephew, we be checkin brazin cash
We kept G's on the omni floor
Put the bloody bills with the Tommy in the drawer
Tell mummy with the rock, break a lil a corner off
I don't like that bammer, I don't wanna cough
You got to watch every step
P walk and pull out a teck
I thought you knew I'm a vet
Let loose and threw up my set
A-W-A-X to Latex
Glove on my left hand can only mean death mayne.

(CHORUS)

This is aint nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to Chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop
This is aint nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to Chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop

(THIRD VERSE)

Now it's that pimpin ass Gringo
Bitch is you single?
I spit heat, hit the street, stack em out the window
Bay area lingo, iz what a playa blessed with
Ten shots with his own spots is all I ever messed with
So if you broke, I aint even hearda ya
Come around me again and ima murder ya
I need some loot, so watch how I take ya town
A bitch wanna hold me, I track her down
Get up in the brain, take over the soul
4 G's a night, I'm ready to roll
A big long black hella beat in the trunk
Baby kick back its hella heat for the funk
A dare a mutha fucker, a step to the low
One too many drinks, now he's gettin a roll
So? Tell them get this
It's JT, I'm a dog when I spit this

(CHORUS)

This is aint nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to Chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop
This is aint nothing new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to Chill, try to stop
Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop
