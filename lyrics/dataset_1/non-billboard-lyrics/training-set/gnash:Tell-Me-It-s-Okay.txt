Tell-Me-It-s-Okay:gnash
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Hey
I think I might move on to something new
But only if you say that's cool with you
Cause I love all the little things you do (I mean did)

Cause
I begged you to show up
And I asked you to stay
You told me to grow up
So I pushed you away
I tell you "you know what"
And we fought once again
Then we got back together
Who's kidding who, it's a trend
Because
I like being alone
But I don't like being lonely
I like being home
But I don't like being homies
You know I'm so sorry
For making you feel you lost me
We're two unstable enablers
Please try not to be salty

Because
All this time and all these tries
Leave questions open ended
And I would rather die
Than try to live with this resentment
So we could try just one more time

To make sure that we meant it
Or we could cut our losses
Before we blow up and dead it
So

Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)

Tell me it's okay

Hey
It's okay to say you're not okay
It's not okay to turn and walk away
We've got problems that we need to face
If you love me, then say it
If you trust me, then show it
If you don't mean it, save it
If you do mean it, own it
You gotta be happy alone
To be happy together
You gotta lose something u know
To learn how to get better
I've been working, you've been hurting

I've been curving, you've been swerving
I've been sleeping, you've been creeping
Now you got me creeped, I'm leaving
I think about you
I dream about you
I smile about you
I cry about you
I lie about you
I'm fine without you
I lied that's not true
I'd die without you
Our love is a war, we use words as our weapons
So either you're real or I'm gone in a second
These thoughts that we have and these feelings we kept in
Make resent and regret, upset and a severance
You don't fuck with ultimatums

Have to face it
Loves contagious
Also dangerous
Leaves you damaged
Make it painless

Now don't make sense
Tried to saved it
Please please please

Tell me it's okay
Please please please
Tell me it's okay
Please please please
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
To be happy now
Because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay
