I don't want you to leave me(oh no no nooo) stay by my side Together we ride (we ride) like Bonnie & Clyde
Sometimes I do a lil extra, I do not mean to upset ya, wanna hold you
And protect ya, feelin' like we can do better
Baby lets push away from all the pressure, I take you overseas for the summer
We both love money bae let's get these commas
I don't care what they say I'm always gon' love ya
We go to war together make 'em suffer
If I had then you had it to, your swagger match my swagger too
Gil I kno' I ain't perfect, just kno' that I'm worth it
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride til the very end, just me & my girlfriend

{Jr 2 crucial}
It was love at 1st sight, I knew she was mine when she felt wrong I made it right
She right by my side, ready to ride. If lovin' you is a crime I'll do the time
She got my back like a spine, this is true love no reason to lie If it look impossible we make it possible
Take her wherever I told her its optional she my number 1
There's no replacement, when they see us together that's when they hating
Don't care if they hatin' cuz...
