Let-s-Go-Featuring-Cam-ron-:Juelz Santana
I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back these feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, come on, come on, let's get on

Let's get it on, nigga
Man, let's get it on, man
Santana, you on your own, man, hold the set down
Let's do it, man, Dipset, we got these bastards
Man, let's do it

Yeah, you niggas dealin' with a G from the block
Yeah, it's me from the block, quick to tell a nigga let's get it on
But I don't really like to beef on the block
That bring heat to the block
I got to eat on the block, nigga, let's get it on

Yeah, you dealin' wit a pimp from the hood
Keep a chick from the hood
Quick to tell her, â€½Aye, let's get it onâ€
Come on, let's go, I'm tryin' to do it so aye, let's get it on

I'm one hell of a guy,  fly fella can fly
Like Scarface, one hell of a high, let's get it on
One hell of a ride that I drive
23s look like the propellers on the side, yep, let's get it on

Who stuntin' like me? Who frontin' like me?
Who did it, who get it, who done it like me, you?
  (Let's get it on)
Who wishin'? Who frontin'? Who want it from me, you?
Come get it, you want it, it's nothin' to me an' you
  (Let's get it on)

Chumps already know how I feel
When it comes to pumpin' the steel
It's like let's get it on

You know what these wild boys tote
Tie 'em up with the cowboy rope
So let's get it on, let's get it on, y'all, it's love
Hey ma, back that ass up, lookin' back
I almost crashed up, so let's get it on
That's love right there, hit 'em one more time

Man, you dudes can get it
That's my word to the slant on my Houston fitted, let's get it on
I send rockets at you dudes an' midgets
Send cock up in you goose an' pigeons, so let's get it on

I know you like that, mama
I'll be right back, mama, so let's get it on
Yeah, do you believe me, don't you believe me?
Won't you believe me? Come, let's get it on

On any given Sunday or any given Monday
We headed up the runway
  (Let's get it on)
Uptown, yeah, we headed up a one-way
Her head is in my lap, so I let her do her one thing
  (Let's get it on)

She was Jamaican, so I feed her bread an' dumplings
Vegi-pads an' rum cake, told her, â€½Lets get it onâ€
Said she 18, live crazy just like me
'80s baby just like me so let's get it on

'80s baby, huh? Get it on then, let's get it on
Hey baby, you know what your boy holds
All night, long pipe, long strokes, let's get it on
Told you right, let's get it on, ma, listen, let's get it on
Hey ma, roll wit the winners an' I ain't talkin' dinner
I'm like, â€½Let's get it onâ€

Told you, man, we can get it on
Matter o' fact, let's do it right now
One more time, Santana

Yeah, man, I roll through, stroll through
Flag on the right side of my whole crew, screamin', â€½Let's get it onâ€
They'll get ya, they'll twist ya, they'll split ya whole body
In half, then dismiss ya, let's get it on

But I'm lookin' for a bad lil' mama, get mad like her papa
Gotta ass like her mama
  (Let's get it on)
Got her own, won't ask for a dollar
Go half on a scama  an' will laugh when I holla let's get it on

Half? Yeah, that's love
  (Let's get it on)
Hey baby, to ride on this chrome
Just provide us with dome, so let's get it on
That's love, that's love right there
You must be used to me spendin', nope, not tonight
That don't cost nothin', it's free, a freebie

Hey ma, if you gave good brain
You'll get your Dipset chain, so let's get it on
You know, that's about 20 thousand
You know that's for nothin', let's get it on

Lights out, nothin' to fight 'bout
Got the pipe out, so let's get it on
It's the only thing to do, I mean it's only right
Let's get it on, baby, let's get it on
That's love, baby, let's get it on
