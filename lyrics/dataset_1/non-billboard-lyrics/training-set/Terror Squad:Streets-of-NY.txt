On the streets of New York
I was standin' by the Hydrin watchin' time fly by
Me and Crazy Lou, Tony Tuibe with them brown eyes
Conversing 'bout nothin' just watchin' time fly
Nothin' to do man except be with the crews and
That's when I see the moon and the stars align
I talkin' 'bout when she walked on by
I thought I saw Heaven, well

I'm just givin' it up for my baby
Givin' it up for my darlin'
Givin' it up for my baby
I'm thanking God that I found my darlin'
