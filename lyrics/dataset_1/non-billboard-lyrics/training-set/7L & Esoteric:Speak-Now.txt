Speak-Now:7L & Esoteric
[Intro]
"Ladies and gentlemen"
[scratching: Vinnie Paz]
"Y'all better listen to this"

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yo, yo, I'm Jesus my right hand writes diseases
My left hand will strike and fight ya weakness
I'm covered in blood wherever the feast is
Find me covered in blood wherever police is
I'm covered in blood wherever ya niece is
I'm covered in mud from burying heaters
Vinnie Paz fuck whoever Vinnie Paz pleases
Hit you in the chest 'til you don't even know what breathe is
We demons, wid bloodlust for heathens
Born through a storm on a see wid Galileans
In cold regions, we rockin' it well
And that's for every fuckin' time I drop in a 'tel
And that's for every fuckin' time I'm droppin' a shell
And that's for every fuckin' time I pop and you yell
Mop you in hell, you motherfuckers can't stop us
You more over hype than Eliom Gonsalez

[Hook]
Aiyyo we speak now, or forever hold our peace
A-O-T-P shook rappers call police
[scratching]
I'm savage, I'm-I'm savage
I write rhymes in pitch blackness
[x2]

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I dump you like candle wax you a waste product like twenty packs
I handicap give panic attacks like anthrax
You catch a, foreign disease like overseas
Fuck borin' emcees I bring Thor to his knees
I'm a master like Fard, I bombard and blast hard
We thrash thoughts some ask God you bas-tard
It's the rap ji-had, you a re-tard
I'm rollin' through Islamabad like this is my backyard
You ready, I'm heavy like the case of Sandra Levy
Tapin' that you crazy
seven thirty bug when you actually one eighty, a half way thug
Yo my act stay drugged of dope tracks and raps
Girls wid nice racks in two hundred dollar hats
It's the world I can't escape
My brain's curlin' great weight
"This shit is sick", yeh I make the greatest hits
But I give it every verse I ever spit on one dis
Cats talk shit this is what they get
A grand prize two black eyes and a busted lip
And for being rude we include a brutal beatin'
I'll have you eatin' food through a feedin' tube as you retreat

[Hook x2]

[Apathy talking]
Awright awright hold up hold up settle down
Listen up you motherfuckers
This the last time you gon' hear me like this shit
So I'm gon' show you why I'm the king of this shit
Apathetic

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Enhanced tactical fightin' machinery
Combattin' on army scenery
strategic-ly movin' my mics like Stratego
I generate graphics like Neo Geo
Flyin' science I incite riots try it's why it's
Violence at maximum levels
The difference of angels and devils
Rectangles and circles, techs fatal to murder
Next week I'm famous
Great as the latest wid the upper hand like four aces
In poker approachin' jokers loc I load and stroke the trigger
Thirty eight claibre bullets travel through barrels
rippin' through apparel parallel to where medics will sterile scapels
dwellin' swellin' organs of felons bullets obliterate melons, with ease
Police yell freeze, ease the gun down
Under the influence of trees alleyways I run down
Pantin' and handlin' mechanical weapons I'm brandishin'
Fleein' foreign in areas I camouflage to vanishin'
Release the dogs, sounds of hounds pound my eardrums
Here comes a fearful doberman poke him in his cerebrum
I'm almost free, around the tree I glance advancin'
slowly cautiously awkwardly while negotiators talk to me
To dark I see the light, but not the squad car
It's comin' from the sky bright green, what an odd star
The odds are I blast off barely a clip
But then I noticed the strange star was an alien ship
Just as the bullet grazed my temple, the ship shot out a beam
It was green and it paralyzed the whole SWAT team
Cops floated in the air and their weapons disassembled
I trembled for my metal but I'm frozen in the mental
Unaware that I was in control of the ships in the air
And how the cops turned if they ever returned
if their bodies burn like candles on a mantle in a urn
I forced 'em to learn I played God like George Burns
