Bottles:Tony Yayo
[Intro:]
Let's go yayo
Hundred bottles
Let's get it in
In this mother [?] Ahs too many greets
Hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles

[Verse 1:]
Low studios Lord knows this is faith
4 season on my neck ca-call of clarity and carry weight
Moves on sees carrot cake,
I'm blessed so the average nigga hate
I move five thousand grams different holes on my instagram
I'm often in distant land instant pass for the gang
Money ain't a thing six pinky ring
My eyes chinese I'm on point like Lin
And I ain't trying to hit the bing
I am trying to hit shorty off in the beam
And pass of to the team

[Hook:]
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
This is your [?] You know how is
Is my birthday I had too many drinks
Tell them sent a hundred bottles
Tell them sent a hundred bottles

[Verse 2:]
Please after I mention '06
Old swag I'm an Alex McQueen kicks
What you mean bitch my money is illuminati
I sacrifice for some million and a maseratti
Swag Saks Fifth dot com
I let your boo drive the car, 200 for the fun
In front the club like Trae and PYT
I'm older in the benz Mr.Cuffin' ten
We ain't loving them we ain't really loving them
Work in the pirates time to cook again
Lil beat dance, going three brakes
And south side in the trap and a cute bitch
She the bomb like a nuclear scientist
A hundred bottles like a UFO is in this bitch
But we spillin' dough in this bitch
And we let it show in this bitch

Tell them sent a hundred bottles
