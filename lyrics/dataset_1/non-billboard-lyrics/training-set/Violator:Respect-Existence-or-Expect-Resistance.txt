Respect-Existence-or-Expect-Resistance:Violator
In defiance with your greed
We will reclaim the streets
Ready to fight to dethrone you
We won’t accept to be your waste

Organized we will stay
‘cause living is not a benefit
Your pretention of control
Has found and imminent end

Must respect existence
Or expect resistence

We have taken this land
Forgotten and left to die
Created your own destiny
And put our lives in our hands

Now you come with brutality
Police aggressors by tour side
But as long as we exist
We will get strength to resist

From acceptance to resistance
From conformity to reaction

Gas bombs-burning eyes
A violent strike- you now die
A last breath- afflicted cries
Injustice wounds- it’s time to fight
