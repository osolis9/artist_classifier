Riddin:Chamillionaire
[** feat. Dorrough, Paul Wall & Slim Thug:]


[Intro: ~Chamillionaire~]
Aay aay... aay aay*
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in
I brought my DJ with me, that mean we goin in

[Chorus: ~Chamillionaire~]
I'm the main event (woah) {2x}
Still grindin' in the streets like I am innocent
I'm the main event (woah) {2x}
Tryin' to get it like the money that I may be spend

I'm the main event (woah) {2x}
Still hustlin' like I know it's time to pay the rent
I'm the main event (woah) {2x}
You lookin' for me, you can find me where the money at

[Verse: ~Chamillionaire~]
The walking after party
Texas I am what it is
Exit the bar if you ain't tryna get your card slid
There ain't no big dogs
They jus bought big
But I ain't never seen the damage that a dog did
Is the Chamillionaire
I only trust ben
I brought some ladies with me
That mean I am plus ten
I brought my dj with me
That mean we going in
I do it big like my jimmy was tucked in
Nuts large, lucky I don't keep my dick exposed
See they the past I am the present like some christmas clothes
Reppin texas so don't question if I'm tipping foes
The wheels fly
Every vehicle is pigeon toes
Look at the evidence
Look like it's evident
She wanna bone
She look at me like a skeleton
See this the realest that your radio has ever been
I am in my lms
Somebody better tellem manye

[Chorus: ~Chamillionaire~]
I'm the main event (woah) {2x}
Still grindin' in the streets like I am innocent
I'm the main event (woah) {2x}

[Verse: ~Paul Wall~]
I swear it ain't been the same
Ever since I got cake
Ma hustle is high rate
So haters are all rate
Every dollar I can make
I'm a get it to the day of ma week
I'm on a paper chase for paws
Yee that cookies and cake
And holdin down for ma stick talkin down to ma stick
Ride with me or collide with me
You can't change shit
Southside housten texas
Where I'm roamin the streets
And northside where I sleep
The northside don't sleep
If you sleepin on texas
Better wake up quick
Stop bitin our style
And get off are dick
All the jelousy need quit
And the hatin should stop
Cause the third coast
Ain't never gone flop
I think not partner

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]

Tryin' to get it like the money that I may be spend

Still hustlin' like I know it's time to pay the rent

You lookin' for me, you can find me where the money at
