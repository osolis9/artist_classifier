Love-Me-Back:LunchMoney Lewis
Showed by the job, bringing some to eat
And when she get off, I'ma rub her feet
I love the people she want, when we watch tv
She treat me like shit, I treat her like a queen
Uuh, she don't feel like I do

When a man loves a woman, but the woman don't love him back
It's like tryina play it cool when you're having a hard attack
When a man loves a woman, but the woman don't love him back
No there ain't nothing, ain't nothing worse than that

I took her on a date, and I paid the check
And when I got home I didn't get no sex!
And I said to myself "I deserve better"
She walking all over me 'cause I let her,
I ain't gonna let her no more
I ain't gonna let her no more

When a man loves a woman, but the woman don't love him back
It's like tryina play it cool when you're having a hard attack
When a man loves a woman, but the woman don't love him back
No there ain't nothing, ain't nothing worse than that
Baby I just got a fresh fay and some new jays, but damn girl

You got me looking like a fool
What the hell do I have to do?!
Tell me baby, I'm begging you
Please, please!
You got me looking like a fool
What the hell do I have to do?!
Tell me baby I'm begging you
Please, please!

When a man loves a woman, but the woman don't love him back
It's like tryina play it cool when you're having a hard attack
When a man loves a woman, but the woman don't love him back,
No, there ain't nothing, ain't nothing worse than that
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me back?
