turn my headphones up
louder
un ha
whacha you need
wha whacha need
lolololo white america killing all the puppys
ill be sitting right here outside making money
you be sorry you messed me
going to porto rico at three
cant mess with my rhymes
cause ill throw em at you like dimes
blind people being going death
trying to see me
cause my greatness
got the dictionary going ape
now all the media taking pictures of me
then put them on the walls and get plastic
sugery, they all want to be me
cause i got a jumpshot
hotter than your roasting crock pot
