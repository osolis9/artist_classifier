If-You-Want-It:G Unit
[50 Cent:]
It no secret
You know that
A nigga want to fuck
Its time for chain gang
I'm saying mayne "Dont you tell me whats up"

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it

Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Psych we don't buy pussy bitch
This ain't Murder Inc. this is G Unit
We got hos from coast to coast
To stash the toast
I dare you to approach
I kill if provoked
You a joke
The fact that your stroke
Is on my album
Paid him fifty thousand
Told me how he tickled ya ass you fruit pop
You sing like you in love
You homo thug
The Ex make you feel like a don
An Elton John

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it

Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I play the club with a cup full of Hennessey
Nah, that bitch ain't my girl its just whenever i'm around she pretend to be
Look I don't dance much
I'm in the club with the toast if you wondering why i'm pullin' my pants up
Come alone niggas might ruin ya day
Cause they throwin' elbows while you doin' the shake
After the party i'm on the fence pissin'
Just because I like french fries don't mean I like french kissin'
Bitch

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it

Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
When the sun go down and ya ho ain't home
She with the G Unit getting her freak on
My NY shorty be on some jealous shit
But my L.A. bitch take that fella shit serious
I live on the tour bus and party on the plane
I got hos from Hawaii to motherfuckin' Spain
You can creep in the truck on the low from ya man
Cause all I want to do is get my nuts out the sand

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it

Baby if you want it
That money
You can have it
But you got to fuck me now
Fuck me now baby
If you want it
