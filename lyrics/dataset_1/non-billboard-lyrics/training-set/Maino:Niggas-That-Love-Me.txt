I don’t say a word, these niggas know
No hesitating, my killas go!
Money, hoes and foreign cars
Street nigga to the rap star
Photogenic, windows tinted
Ridin dirty, bitches in it
In the kitchen, coke whippin
Yall talk it, my niggas live it
Dealers love me, killers love me
Brooklyn niggas take a bullet for me (take a bullet for me)
I said Brooklyn niggas take a bullet for me
Name ringing, chain swinging
When it’s on, rain bringing
Certified, diamonds gleaming
45, see the dealie
Real niggas, them come around me
KOB, come and crown me

One time for a real nigga
Couple case for my jail niggas
What these young boys tryna be?
I’m the poster child for those sheets
Ride with us, mafia
Crook niggas, talape up
Unstoppable, no stopping us
These fake niggas cannot be us
Look around me, goons around me
In the jungles, gorillas found me
I’m too high for you to down me
I make the news if you fuckin doubt me
Those the niggas that love me
It’s only one man above me
Them young strippers adore me
Those the bitches that love me
