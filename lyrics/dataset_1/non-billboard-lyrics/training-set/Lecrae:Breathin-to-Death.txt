Breathin-to-Death:Lecrae
Help me Lord before there's no time left

It's like I'm tired of life
Lord i'm wrong I cant get right
Lord its Dark and I cant get light
why it cant be light it's so heavy why my sin won't let me see the end
come get me
please get me
my thoughts my mind
my ways all evil
I'm sposed to be your people I'm sposed to see your sequal
I said I'll never leave you
But I'm so left i aint right Lord I'm sleeping with death
I am cheating with death
am I deaf cause Its like I cant hear
I question my salvation cause it's like I don't fear you
I'm on a selfish island i am no where near you
God i really need you even tho I don't appear to
I'm drinking out a broken cistern that could never hold water and I'm soon to get burned
tho I try i never satisfy or quench this yearn
I hear you calling but it's like a fight for me to just turn

Hook:
Help me Lord before there's no time left I aint living I'm just breathing to death (echo) Your ways are perfect and they lead me to rest Mine are evil and they lead me to death

I'm feeling skitzophrenic
maye I'm not saved cause i have to get high just to block out all the pain
seen death, seen hurt seen a whole lotta thangs
but instead of running from it I'm running away from change
it's like I'm outside in the ice cold weather
the rains coming down and I keep getting wetter
I know I'm getting sick and I could die any second
but still I refuse to let your truth make me better
I'd rather eat flies and maggots instead of bread
and its killing me slow but i cant get it through my head
you were stabbed you were murdered
and for me is why you bled
but I spit on your bloody face as If i never cared
Lord how dare i compare my pain
your father turned his back
and you were left to hang
I don't know why you did it that I cant explain
how can you love this sinner whose desecrated your name
I deserve the flames

I know I tell lies
I know that I am dirt
I know that I am nothing but you can give me worth
I don't know if I know you
But still I know I should
I know the days are evil and only you are Good
I've to the conclusion that I would like to change cause all the worlds money and fame cannot sustain
I know that i should turn but thats the hardest thang
cause do I really feel that have Jesus is a gain
the world is so tempting
Satan is a beast
he hypnotizes my eye to say the least
But jesus be my treasure to know you is live
and I am here dying trying everything there is
All I need in life is you
help me turn away from sin
give me grace to turn away and the fear not to give in
I know that I'm not perfect but if I could rest in Him
I know i don't deserve it but I'll take your hand
