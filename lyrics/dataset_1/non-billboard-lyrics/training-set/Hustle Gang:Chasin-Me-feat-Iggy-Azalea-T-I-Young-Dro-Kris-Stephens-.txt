Chasin-Me-feat-Iggy-Azalea-T-I-Young-Dro-Kris-Stephens-:Hustle Gang
Too much money for a spit
These bitches can't stand me
I told em they just chasin
They could catch me on the TV
Got that triple 8
stays before the kids that keeep a PG
All my dancers
Swear to God I roll you for the Fiji
These bitches always tryna hold a bitch back
Pussy on a pedestal
Now tell them hoes kiss that.
Nowadays I'm feelin like fuck a hater feelings
Cause they got me fucked up like sex on the ceiling
I'm a take now these hoes is tip
tippin on my dick
I'm in Texas like I'm Trae Tha Truth
Sippin on that grit
Hold a temporary visa but thick as a southern belle
And if y'all mad at that I'm just sayin'
I'll fuck em well
