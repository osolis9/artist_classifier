Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me

You can tell me how you want it
Don't fight it, you can tell me how you like it

I ain't here to sell you dreams
Or paint you some pretty pictures
I just wanna get in those jeans
And just like a rivalry, lick ya

Baby, you got me feelin', crazy
Don't worry 'bout these haters
Wait up, wait up, I got room keys
Come see me later

We can fulfill fantasies, so call your girls
Don't be mad at me, excuse me baby, I'm freaky, girl
Sugar check this out, this gon' be a night to remember

Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up

Now, I'm feelin' a little woozy
It's like the room's spinnin' and movin'
I feel her body next to mine
And I'm so fucked up, it's like I'm blind

All I feel is her throwin' it back
And I'm lovin' that
I'm so caught up in the moment
Ain't no holdin' back, never that

Mami, ain't on E
But I got her eyes rollin' back
Mami, it's all on me
Let me show you how to play wit that

Now please, let me show you a freak's technique
I know that you're a freak, you're just discreet
Sugar check this out, this gon' be a night to remember
I can tell by the way you shake it, aw now

Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up

Baby, you ain't gotta front if you want me
All you gotta do is come get me, shorty 'cause I want you
Ooh, I wanna show you, ooh, I wanna shake it up

Baby, baby, ooh, ooh, baby
You ain't gotta front if you want me
