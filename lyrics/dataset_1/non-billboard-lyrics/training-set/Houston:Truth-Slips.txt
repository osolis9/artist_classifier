Truth-Slips:Houston
I'm over you I'm doin' fine
no longer blue I hardly ever cry
a memory of distant shores
was haunting me not anymore

and I am keeping myself busy
have as much fun as I can have
I choose to do instead of thinking of you

it's allright I don't need the love thing
hot nights a life in the fast lane
big cars nobody´s stopping me
sometimes I used to deny it
you hold you hold on and fight it
truth is I'm finally over you

the things you did I could not forget
the words you said remained ‘cause I would let them

but now i‘m keeping myself busy
have as much fun as I can have
I choose to do instead of thinking of you

it's allright it's good to be me now
clubnights it's good to be seen now
shine bright and the drinks are always free
spotlights a star on arrival
not just some girl in denial
truth is I'm totally over you

it's allright I don't need the love thing
hot nights a life in the fast lane
big cars nobody's stopping me
sometimes I used to deny it
you hold you hold on and fight it
truth is I'm finally over you
(I am over I am over you over you now)
