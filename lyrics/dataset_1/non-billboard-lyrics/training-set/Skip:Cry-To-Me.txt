Cry-To-Me:Skip
Sometimes it's so hard to be, happy
When all you do is hold on to your insecurities
A hurting heart is the most, painful
So let it all out and, oh cry
()
Cry... cry to me, if u wanna
Its fine... fine by me
Cause i'll hold you, you see inside...
Heard you leave
So cry... cry to me
(2)
When will you emerge from, your hideaway
From your true feelings that you want, escape
Maybe it's my mind driftin too far away, into space
Fly away to a, better place
There's no other spot I'd rather lay
So don't be scared no, I won't hurt you

Cry... cry to me, if u wanna

Cause i'll hold you, you see inside...
Heard you leave
So cry... cry to me

We're better together, in any weather
If it's cold im your sweater
If it rains I'm your umrella
No one is perfect, but to me you're perfection
What are flaws beside, their creation
Ain't gonna walk trough the heartaches
Walk through the pain
Don't feel alone in the shadow
You're not the one to blame
society deceives your mind
Tells you what you should be
How to look and to act, and what to believe is real
Let it all go, it will make you feel better So drop it all and cry to me if you want to
