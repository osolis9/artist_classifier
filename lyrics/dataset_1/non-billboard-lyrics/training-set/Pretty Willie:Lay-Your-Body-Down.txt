Lay Your Body Down
Lay your body down
And let me touch your body
And you know what's going down
And ain't nobody hear to stop it
And I know you heard about my freaky reputation
But don't listen to the crowd
Cause you know they be hating on me 
I know it's been a minute 
Since I spent some time with you
But what I wanna do
Is simply spit my ooh wee ooh
No need to rush it ma
Look make everything suitable
Gotta let you know 
This proposition's not refusable
We gonna play this song right here
So you better get your body in gear
Get comfortable and have no fear
Cause you know it's going down in here so
Lay your body down
And let me touch your body
And you know what's going down
And ain't nobody hear to stop it
And I know you heard about my freaky reputation
But don't listen to the crowd
Cause you know they be hating on me 
I know you heard about Tamika and Teresa who
Stephanie, Candy, Tylisha, Jasmine, and Leslie too
Now tell me ma look what that got to do with you
You seem uncertain ma so why don't I give you a clue
I'll kiss it where the sun don't shine
After that mami then you'll do mine
Turn over and let me see it from behind
You'll call the coroner after this rhyme so
Lay your body down
And let me touch your body
And you know what's going down
And ain't nobody hear to stop it
And I know you heard about my freaky reputation
But don't listen to the crowd
Cause you know they be hating on me
Lay your body down
And let me touch your body
And you know what's going down
And ain't nobody hear to stop it
And I know you heard about my freaky reputation
But don't listen to the crowd
Cause you know they be hating on me 
Lay your body down
And let me touch your body
And you know what's going down
And ain't nobody hear to stop it
And I know you heard about my freaky reputation
But don't listen to the crowd
Cause you know they be hating on me
