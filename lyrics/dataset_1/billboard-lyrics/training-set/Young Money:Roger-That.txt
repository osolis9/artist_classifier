Roger-That:Young Money:6:2010-05-15

I'm in the collard green 6 cornbread in the guts
Got dat halloween kicks trick or treat in the clutch
C'mon nigga is you trickin or what?
Flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Jus hopped off the plane came back from van couv
Little white tee sum boobs n bamboo
White girls tell me "Hey Nicki your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?"
Asalaam alaikum no oink fa me
N I never let a d boy boink for free
Cuz its barbie bitch you can join the wave
I done penny nickel dime I done coined the phrase
You coudn't beat me there if ya had a leer
Indian style court side wit a cavalier
Vip roseas you can have a beer
Cuz honey when you gettin money you dont have a care.

Roger Dat Young black ricos
Kill fa da c notes

Gon head n deep throat

Smoke more than 4 quarters we call it sudden death
