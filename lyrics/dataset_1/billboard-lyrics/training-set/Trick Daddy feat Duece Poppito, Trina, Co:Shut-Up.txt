Ridin round in my brand new ninety-nine, fo' do', Volvo
I got a pocket full of be's,
cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go tho'
But all my Boca Boys they know though, that's fo' sho' doe
(Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearin?)
Hell nah hoe, you know they Polo's
I been used again, accused again - this time
been wrong to chop somethin done by one of my union friends
Soon as they seen the Benz, hatin season was in
Hell cause they figured me for not understandin they reason bein
Heh, but I'm the man for this
While y'all was doin fine I was doin time just, prayin for this
Locked up, makin plans for this
Without all that fancy shit, way too advanced for this
Just Polo socks, tanktops and drawers up under my pants and shit
Shut up!
Ah hah, okay, whassup? Shut up!

You need a grand just to speak to me
Okay, are you sure you want to sleep with me?
Okay, you better be fo' sho'
Cause I done left niggaz like you stuck befo'
