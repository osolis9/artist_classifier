It-s-Goin-Down:Yung Joc:1:2006-11-04

Dis nigga go by the name of joc (joc?)
He resides in collegepark (collegepark cp)
But for right now what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)

Niggaz in my face
Damn near er' day
Askin a million questions like
Joc where ya stay
Tell 'em collegepark
Where they chop cars
in 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Just bought a zone jays on my feet
I'm on that patron so get like me
69 cutlass wit the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk ballin just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin dough
If a girl chews let her do her thang
Just like her mama nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me I'm so fly
Niggaz throw the duces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do (ok)

Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

numba 2 do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of ben franks
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boi magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I thank they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggaz know my crew we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls likin girls time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down
Meet me in the trap its goin down
Meet me in the mall its goin down
Meet me in the club its goin down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down
