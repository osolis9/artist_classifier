MAC, L'Oreal, yep, â€~cause I'm worth it
Love the way I puts it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway, they can't say nothin'

Oh, oh oh, my lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the MAC-MAC brushes
L'Oreal got them Wa-watermelon Crush-es

Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virtue
They lovin' lip gloss universal

Sittin' in 8th period, thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loud speaker on the double
I stepped in the office like, â€½Yes Ms. McClarkson?â€
She's like, â€½Girl ran out of my lip gloss an' â€

"Write down where you get yours from
â€~Cause I must admit that Bubble Gum
It's poppin', it's poppin' â€
It's poppin, she ain't frontin'

And uh, I be lovin' it, I be, I be lovin it, uh

On my lips, my lips, uh, my lip gloss
