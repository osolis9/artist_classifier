Same-Damn-Time:Future:16:2012-07-28

Y'all don't wanna play fair
Know what I mean
Aye, yeah

I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time

Gucci made in Italy Bally belt I'm killing shit
The way I'm rocking Jimmy Choo tha word got out I'm dealing it
I fuck her she a immigrant don't touch her she ain't got benefits
Bussing down them Benjamin's fuck it up my Louie kicks
Dats tha way I'm kicking it Ferragamo cover me
Puerto Rican Japanese we laid up at the double tree
Yellow ice a bumble bee pinky ring a quarter key
iPhone a metro twerking off tha whole thing
My earring a jelly bean gangsta lean an Irene
Red eyes no visine I'm loc'd out on tha drink
Horseshoes on my jeans Robin jeans wit tha Wings
Yellow bone on my team trafficking them Yao Mings
Space boots wit tha spikes go to AZ on a flight
Mail a hundred overnight, yea yea yea yea

I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time

pps with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds round my neck no fugazay
Bad bitches in the suite tryna to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga streets raised me
Working wit a unit tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that active and it's tasting like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check born on a jet
Talking on the iPhone sipping out tha styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free Bandz and Al Capone
And my cash way long (turn up)
I see a bunch of clones

I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time

Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's that's how I clear 'em
Jumping cross me you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When I cash that cash money smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler drop my bail on your ring
Spent so much in Louis gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup wit me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan take a clip
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film (Movie, Future, Astronaut)

I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time
