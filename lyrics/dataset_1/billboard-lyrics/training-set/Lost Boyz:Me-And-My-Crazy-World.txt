Me-And-My-Crazy-World:Lost Boyz:5:1997-11-29

Yeah, 1997
Tony Fantell
Me and my crazy world
You know what I'm saying
Will my niggas that feel me throw your hands up
You know what I'm saying
All my honeys that know how we do throw your hands up
This the joint, for real
Yeah, we got my team in here
[incomprehensible] how we always do representing knocking shit down
Yeah, right
Feel me, yeah
Come on

Now, I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong 'cause I don't wanna lose none of them
Am I confused? 'Cause I don't wanna choose one of them

It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question show my honeys love in every way
Possible, I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass, plus I love that ass

Short and sexy, lips always wet see
I go downtown 'cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way, sometimes we just chill and lay

In the sack, I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is, can't say her name
'Cause if I do I won't be true to my game
Word up

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

Yo, I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

Now, my next one, she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Every time I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty can't wait

Now, I can still remember when we first met each other
Exchanged numbers promised we won't forget each other
Goes to work and school, that's cool
No doubt, that's why a nigga went that route

Uniform Foot Locker, shorty lookin' proper
She's out to get me, can't stop her
Know I had a lover, yo, still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength for her

Yo, chatted, talked about, see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long, shorty had to go back to work
Something inside said, "That will work"

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

I thought I couldn't live with chicks 'cause they be to demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding
Like, well who was that? Where you goin'? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with

Don't let these niggas in the street get your head up
Like they can do better than me plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinkin' to me short, she thought that I'm

Some clown nigga, she can scream on and talk to
I had to run her down the line this ain't no walk through
Now who the fuck you think you talkin' to, chick
Your complaining's makin' me sick

Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo, understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say, "Everyday, I be there for my friend
Good things always come to an end"

So yo, I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

Yo, I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't want to let none of them go

See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes, I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere

Word, she began by saying "Try after try"
It's a done deal, now I'm singing, "Bye-bye"
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try

Too many threats kid, got to let her go
Always in your corner, got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give, we talked out

I'm feeling pain as it came to an end
I said to shorty, "I will always be your friend
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I ain't going nowhere, for real"

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

Don't want to let them go, oh
Don't want to let them go, oh
Baby
[incomprehensible]
Baby
Oh
