23:Mike WiLL Made-It feat Miley Cyrus, Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J:2:2014-03-22

Ah-ha. I'm so fresh man (EarDrummers)
Man, y'all scared to do it how I do it
(Tahahahahaha... Mike Will Made It...)

I'm, in the club high off purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on
(I'm, in the club high off purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on)
J's on my feet (you know it)
J's on my feet (you know it)
J's on my feet (you know it)
So get like me (hm-mm)
J's on my feet (you know it)
J's on my feet (we trippy)
J's on my feet (we trippy)
So get like me (hm-mm)

I be in the club (the club) standin' on the couch (the couch)
In them Wolf Greys (what) like it's my house (I'm home!)
Drinkin' out the bottle, I got no respect (AY)
Lookin' like a model, who just got a check (change)
I back it up, cause I don't give a fuck (I don't)
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us (uh-uh)
I'm MC Hammer fly (fresh), you can't touch (nope)
J's so fly - I should, work at, Flight, Club

Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I'm +Naughty by Nature+ like I'm +Hip-Hop Hooray+
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I'm 'bout to turn up now

I'm, in the club high off purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

I be rockin' J's or I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors, my kick game is major
More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley (Smiley), Miley (Miley)
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned
Got choppers if they wanna try me (if they wanna try me)
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe (wannabe)
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23
Put on my J's and dance (tahahahahaha...) the whole night away

I'm +Naughty by Nature+ like I'm +Hip-Hop Hooray+ (Uhh)
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side

I stay showin' out (hm-mm), my kick game is a beast (hm-mm)

I got thirty pair of J's that ain't never been released (you know it)
Flu game twelve (ho), Space Jam 11 (BITCH)
On the hype beast sick, they gon' need a paramedic (cash)
Turn up, turn up, turn up - I got trippy, I stay live (ho)
All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's (we sippy)
I'm so high, I got three bitches that go bi (pussy)
I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
