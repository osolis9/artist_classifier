Oooh, she's just my type 
Hair long and her eyes light
Her smile shine like the sunlight
One of a kind, baby momma type
Friend muggin, she the hater type
Waka Flocka, I'm the player type 
Jewelry bright, winter white
Champagne chilled on ice
Hold up!
Every bad bitch in the club to the dance floor
Hands on your hips, get real low
Throwing money, my M.O
So slot me your info

Wanna see me do tricks with the next chick
Anyway, boobs up and my ass out
Somebody get a medic when he pass out

They your size, little waist don't match your thighs
Say you're on my level but my level too high
Looking in your eyes, don't look so surprised
I know you ain't heard that, before
Searching in the club and I just found one
Pick up lines, I just dropped mine
Single for the night, tryna double my fun
So whats up, to the bad bitch
In the corner, with her ass big
And her hair long, I'mma grab it
She call me daddy, but I'm a bastard
Like, I ain't tryna be horse & carriage
Or tryna take care of you, so put your bad habit
I just wanna smash it, smash it
Pass it, show you where the cash is, cash is
But first lemme see you...

Get it low, get it low

See you get it low, get it low, get it low, get it low
To the floor, to the floor, to the floor
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me let me know
