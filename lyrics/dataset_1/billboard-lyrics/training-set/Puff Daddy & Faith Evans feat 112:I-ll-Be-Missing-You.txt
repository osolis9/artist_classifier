I-ll-Be-Missing-You:Puff Daddy & Faith Evans feat 112:1:1998-01-24

Yeah, this right here goes out to everyone
that has lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out...

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they came to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream
In the future can't wait to see if you
Open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometimes, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath

I know you're still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take

What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Everyday we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on

Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you're still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day

When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Somebody tell me why...
On that morning
When this life is over

I know, I'll see your face

Every night I pray (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)
Every step I take (we miss you)
Every move I make (we miss you)
Every single day (we miss you)
Every time I pray (we miss you)
I'll be missing you (we miss you)
Thinking of the day (we miss you)
When you went away (we miss you)
What a life to take (we miss you)
What a bond to break (we miss you)
I'll be missing you (we miss you)
