Gotta-Get-It:Juvenile:23:2009-12-05

Y'all think broke look cool, man

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it

I am Magnolia official, I played the Ave for years
They talkin' 'bout me like when Shaq went to the Cavaliers
I keep the wit me, just call me prince of keys
Sellin' tobacco and ain't none of my is nicotine

A dog gettin' it, how much can a gorilla make?
I'm tryna chill, don't wanna have to put on ma killa face
I get whatever I wanna, boy, I don't wish it would
When I come out, look out, I be sharper then a stick of wood

I wish somebody would, I make somebody bleed
I cut somebody like three dollars worth of Limburg cheese
I lay somebody down, I probably have to do or die
Won't nothin' change, I'ma stay gutter like a sewer line

Yup, it's manure time, business is picking up
When find out I'm the man, they probably give it up
No, I ain't new to this money thing, boy, I been a fool
You tryin' to chill, I'ma blow up this just like a inner tube

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

I gotta get it so people, get on yo' day jobs
Ain't nothin' crowded but the jail houses and graveyards
I'm on the corner in the ghetto like a pay-phone
I call my baby, like, "Daddy be on the way home"

Talk to you later, it's easy to get ya cell tapped
And I got powder like a factory full of gel caps
I'm ballin' in the game, boy, I need a pair or two
I'm walkin' on 'em in my slippers like a pair of Lugz

I'm not gone ever lead the way, that's what the preacher said
Like I'ma be on the corner at Morgan Freeman age
I'm in the streets making connections in them restaurants
I'm eatin' tacos and fajitas with the Mexicans

Well, I define the definition of what livin' is
And anyway you see me out, it's what thanksgiving is
You'all some counterfeit papas, I am a real daddy
Shoot up the world, I tell it would keep the kids happy

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

I gotta get it, boy, you beefin' over petty change
I'm ready, man, I got my fingers in on e'rythang
I'm on 'em Dana Danes, puffin' on that
Look, I'ma leader, it's one of us up in every game

And yeah, I'm fly 'cause I always got that eagle on me
I pop a watch how quick he call the people on me
This is an act and not in it to receive a Tony
I'm over here with all the cheese and I don't see baloney

Give a, what? I be talking mad to 'em
They say I'm dodo like a kindergarten's bathroom
I'm in a yellow Chevy thang with the doors up
I'm smokin', the ashes burnin' my clothes up

See them canaries in the grill? Yup, I talk major
Look at the light, it's like a Saturday night in Las Vegas
Yup, I'ma boss playa 'cause I say I is
I chase this money 24 hours everyday out here

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it

Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta, gotta get it
Gotta get it, gotta get it
