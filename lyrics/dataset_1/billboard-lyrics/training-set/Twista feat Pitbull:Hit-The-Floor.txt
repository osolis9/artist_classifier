Yeah, we gon' take it from the bottom to the windy city
Miami's finest, Chi Town's finest, Pitbull, Twista
And we want all the women to
Boogie boogie boogie, go ahead baby
Boogie boogie boogie, go ahead baby

Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir

Shake it, shake it fo' me
Come and work it for me, shawty but don't break it for me
Wiggle wiggle want you, come on and get naked fo me
Say you like the dick, won't you come and take it from me

Gon' twirk it fo' me while I let the dick slide
Pop it fo me mama, show me you know how to ride
Now stop runnin' from me, go and hold that fatty up
Now let me beat up until you say you've had enough

Pitbull and twista shawty, show me how you work that work that
Got to the flo' but don't hurt that, hurt that
Take you with me if you can show me how you do that
Looking so hot and got the hood hollin', who dat

Hit it so hard mamacita, come and let me inspect yo thigh
Open up because I got a new excercise
I can drop it down pick up the flow
Hit that bitch up with the rhythm and go, get down, hit the flo'

Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'

Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir

When Pits in the area, area
Better check his bank fo direst deposits
Check under yo bed bed, check yo closet
She don't like bacon? Cool I'll give her sausage

If it doesn't make sense, sense
Don't make dollars, dollars
Don't make money, money
Don't make profits, boogie boogie

I just want to give you nook, noogie noggie
Turn around let me see how you would, do me, do me
Put it all together that would be a
Boogie boogie, noogie noogie noogie, do me, do me

Damn it woman, I'm on the track with Twista
So it's only right that I take my words and twist 'em
Watch how I get up and go, watch how I switch up the flo'
Watch how I do it like, no one's done it befo'

Yes, uh Pits a pro
Mami what you fronin' fo'
Girl, do what you do best
Hit the flo'

Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'

Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir

All the chicks be lovin' Twista when he spittin' 'em rhymes
And I be lovin' all the ladies that got dick on they mind
From the windy city down to the dirty south
Like Luda you know, I beat that shit by the word of mouf

I sold 350 the first week
The day after I'm coming at you on a smurf beat
Because he got the base to hit you on the head like a 4 by 4
Now back it up for me, I'm beggin' shawty Por favor

Go and get the other lane, let me show you how to jack it
Aint no like nothin' a brother, you gon' like it when I smack it
Got you in the fantasy, I hope no shit pop off
While we grindin' and I'm trying to get my rocks off

Hope them haters don't coma at me thinking my blocks off
'Cause we known to get the heaters burnin' like hot sauce
Its all because I gave them baby mamas dick on the low
I tell 'em, get down hit the flo'

Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'

Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir

Boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie
