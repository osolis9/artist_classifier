Hey Mackelmore, can we go thrift shopping?

4x What, what, what, what
4x What, what, what, what
+ Bada, bada, badadada

OH

I'm gonna pop some tags,
only got twenty dollars in my pocket.
I, I, I'm hunting, looking for a come up.
This is fcking awesome.

Nah, walk up to the club, like "What up? I got a big cock!"
I'm so pumped, I bought some shit from the thrift shop.
Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty.
People like "Damn that's a cold ass honkey."
Rolling in, hella deep, heading to the mezzanine. Dressed in all pink, 'cept for my gator shoes, those are green. Draped in leopard mink, girls standing next to me.
Probably should've washed this, smells like I carry sheets.
(Pissssss)
But shit it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments. Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in.
Bummy and grungy, fck it man
I am stuntin' and flossin' and
Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, btch.
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style,
No for real - ask your grandpa - can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers.
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'.
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard.
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a kneeboard.
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Miller
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no.
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those,
The sneaker heads would be like "Aw, he got the Velcros"

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come-up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-up shirt
'Cause right now I'm up in her skirt
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searchin' in that section (Uptons)

Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, second-hand, I rock that motherfucker.
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci - that's hella tight."
I'm like, "Yo - that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt."
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt - that's just some ignorant bitch
I call that getting swindled and pimped
I call that getting tricked by a business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand? Then you hella won't
Then you hella won't

(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah!)
