All-The-Above:Maino feat T-Pain:10:2009-07-18

Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me, oh
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be, oh, yeah

I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above, yeah

All the above, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh
All the above, oh, oh, all the above

Listen, really what do you see when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing to me living my dreams
I done been to the bottom, I done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, headed straight to the top

Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I get nothing but love now when I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money ain't going to shame
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain

How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me and I'm still gon' survive

You get truth from me but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me, oh
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be, oh, yeah

I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above, yeah

All the above, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh
All the above, oh, oh, all the above

It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nikes, picture you livin' my life
Picture you stuck in a cell, picture you wasting your life

Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine

You've been seein' me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father tryna hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama

I envision the diamonds, I envision Ferraris
If the world was perfect all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? That I'm making a statement?
Take a look and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

Now if you come to the spot, spot
All the way from out on the block, block
I hustle hard 'cause it's all the same
They know, they know

And you know that grind don't stop, stop
Just 'cause I rose to the top, top
And everybody knows my name
They know, they know

Still grindin', still hustlin'
No more pain, no more sufferin'
To my ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Just start dancing and shine in the love

All the above, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh
All the above, oh, oh

All the above
