King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
You could hear me 'fore you see me I got king Kong in the trunk
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

A yo this beat is bananas
Gave king Kong a treat then put him in the trunk of the McClaren
So when the doors lift up they fall off, fall off
Take a look at my ride, you see the doors fall off
'Cause the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front, they be sitting on my lap
Got the bumper to the ground, Cause the trunk weighing it down
They think it's a low rider when they come from outta town
That's a King Kong, in the trunk, that's the gorillas behind me
When I'm rolling through your hood anybody can find me
You can hear me from the next block
When I'm on the next block, when I'm headed to the next block
Got you jumping to the next block

King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
You could hear me 'fore you see me I got king Kong in the trunk
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

Lil' Momma got you stopping and dropping
When the bass start bumping
So I told her she wasn't talking about nothing, and she just fronting
You can hear me from a block
And you already know what's up
With the women cause they feeling me how it rumble in the trunk

I got plenty speakers up in my trunk and I turned it up
And all the ladies loving how it be bumping
They can hear me coming, you can hear before you see me
I got beats up in the trunk
All the ladies want to chase me when they hear my system bump
I'm 'bout to head out to that Lou
And holla at you 'bout some fetti, hit my celly soon as you ready,
Split this cheese like a deli.
They thought I was a lunatic when I pulled up to the telly
I had that candy coated Chevy, showing it's grill like it's Nelly
And the ladies love me why is that,
They love the way I be getting my lean on
Flip the diamond, and get a multi colored diamond bling on
That King Kong, yea I bet ya this gon' be the theme song
Cause that King Kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone

King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
You could hear me 'fore you see me I got king Kong in the trunk
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me
I got King, I got King Kong

yea, yea, yea, yeah
Them boys is knockin', I got it on lock
Cause I make hits like I'm boxing
Start it up and it sound like a rocket
Then a hater, hating inside, like don't pop with this
See the beats is beating, ya hear me before you see me
Before you even can reach me, it'll have ya thinking
That this boy is a beast in the streets
While ya blinking, have ya bopper looking like you been drinking
I'll eat ya, it's like I have speakers in my speakers
So when they speaking on it all they gon' speak of is a beaster boy
So don't make me just treat ya to a feast

A beast'll just beat off both of your ear drums

King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
You could hear me 'fore you see me I got king Kong in the trunk
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
