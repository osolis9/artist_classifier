I-ve-Got-To-Have-It:Jermaine Dupri & NAS feat Monica:15:2000-07-01

Uh-huh, oh, uh-huh, oh, so so def
(I've got to have it)
See this is what it's all about right here
Understands me, see my life real
  (I've got to have it)
I don't know about yours
Everything I do is an event, Nas, Monica, and me
  (I've got to have it)

When it comes to my honeys in the strip club
Sumpin' on dubs in the middle
What the block like what?
Say my name

When you see me with the crispy fade
Ice it out, glowin' with the lights is out
Yo, say my name
When you see a Bentley or Ferrari
A Maserati, it's probably me
Say my name

When your hear this song bump in the club
When you're chillin' on the corner with your thugs
Say my name
I make it hot and take your block
Who they wanna be and hate they not
Yo, say my name

When your girl don't call you when you beep her
And you hit it and her thing feel deeper
Say my name
Pull on her hair, spankin' her rear
While I'm in 'em, all I wanna hear is you
Say my name

Squeeze my, beef is done
Police come you know the game
Don't say my name
Dipped out crazy
Timbs chicken and gravy
Q B, Dupri baby

When it comes to the clubs packed
Cristal flowin'
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to homes plushed out
Chrome stuck out in traffic
(I've got to have it)

When it comes to a neck full of glow
And a check full of O's, you know
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to my honeys in the strip club
Sumpin' on dubs in the middle
What the block like what?
Say my name

Gotta have my tied up
Iceberg Gucci Rolley
Bezzled up, bezzled up
Gotta have me a double O
With a six in the front
And the bump, bump in the trunk

Gotta have me an Escalade
My house is laid
A man that keeps my bills paid
My records play every day
What can I say?
I've got to have it

When it comes to the clubs packed
Cristal flowin'
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to homes plushed out
Chrome stuck out in traffic
(I've got to have it)

When it comes to a neck full of glow
And a check full of O's, you know
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to my honeys in the strip club
Sumpin' on dubs in the middle
What the block like what?
Say my name

When you see a black do-rag through the tint
Of a black Bent going too fast
Say my name
When you talk about longevity
And they know how to keep gettin' that cash
Say my name

When you're sick of your songs sittin' on the right
And wanna know what the top feels like
Say my name
You wanna know what being hot feel like
And shuttin' down the spot feel like
Say my name

J D from the home where the bowls get thrown
And the dough get gone real quick like
Sick like 40 karats and a chain
Foolish ain't it?
Say my name

Everythin' you did, I've done did double
If you hate to see flash, your ass is in trouble
Scram now and don't look back
'Cause until I die it's like that

When it comes to the clubs packed
Cristal flowin'
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to homes plushed out
Chrome stuck out in traffic
(I've got to have it)

When it comes to a neck full of glow
And a check full of O's, you know
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to my honeys in the strip club
Sumpin' on dubs in the middle
What the block like what?
Say my name

I've got to have it
I've got to have it
I've got to have it
