Key-To-The-Streets:YFN Lucci feat Migos & Trouble:18:2016-12-17

I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug evicting me
We the niggas that want to beef
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

Young nigga from the north
Got my eye on the streets like a hawk
Wrap ‘em, put ‘em on a boat
Boy you better not chock
and Ian kno I run the north
We got the key to the streets
Everybody notice me
Used to dream about 50 thousand in my jeans
Now 50 thousand cheap to me
Remember the days watching the Hot Boys and Master P
Now I'm down in Miami, one phone call, I pull up on Wheezy
All of my niggas with me, you feel me
Straps on everybody in the building
All of niggas came from dealing
Or either they kicking in doors and stealing
I feel like I'm not having no feelings
Before the fame, seen quarter milly

Came from robbing pizza man at the top of [?] building

I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug evicting me
We the niggas that want to beef
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

I'm from the dirty, we play dirty
All these sticks they dirty
We don't fight, get murdered
If my niggas say fuck you then I'm sorry for you
If my niggas ain't fucking, then get out ho, hurry
Real trapper never seen a drought, we gon' ship ‘em out
Any problem, we gon' air ‘em out
What they talking ‘bout?
We don't count [?] now
No we ain't servin' no ounce
We sip purple, we ain't never out
We ain't never out
Hit up Quavo, we gon' need another bano

I'ma fill that bitch with more keys than a piano
All these bitches say they love me, I'm so handsome
Yeah they know ‘bout Lucci goin' out soon, they [?]

I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug evicting me
We the niggas that want to beef
Cause we got the key to the streets

We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

I got the key to the streets my nigga
Just like Dr. Dre, he got the beats
I come straight up out of 1500
That's the block, my niggas over easy
Double cup but no ice tea
Pour me a four before I go to sleep
Fuck around and land in the hospital
Geekin' off the Henn and the lean
24/7, no day off, balling like we in the playoffs
20 bitches at the playhouse
You quick to freeze up when that K out
If that bitch ain't tryna fuck I kick her out the house
Like Martin, lil bitty bitch stay out
They like to [?] until the Ks out
Get to looking for ways out
You niggas ain't workin', get laid off

Trouble decapitate him, blow his face off
Won't get it ‘til these niggas laid off
Assassinating, knock him off like I'm Adolf
Been getting money, 19 with a 650
[?] seem it's stuntin'

I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug evicting me
We the niggas that want to beef
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
