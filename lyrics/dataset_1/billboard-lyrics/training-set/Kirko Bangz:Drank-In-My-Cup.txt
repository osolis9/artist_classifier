Drank-In-My-Cup:Kirko Bangz:1:2012-09-22

I done came down, hold up

Grip the grain, Roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me

'Cuz I ain't trying to control her

She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made to lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man

I'm flying down your boulevard
She cooking dinner with your pants

Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on

Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, they put you to bed
They ain't trying to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm coming baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company

Got this drank in my cup
Oh yeahhhh
I got this drank in my cup (This drank)
I got this drank in my cup (This drank)

Cup, cup.
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style
Same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up

Same page, same book
Different song, same Everytime her nigga tripping
She on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up

She hit me with that same look
Lips biting, hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if u got that sip type
Only if u got that wine fine
Only if u got that sip type
Only if u got that mine bomb
Only if u got that Zip type
Eat that shit like Wonton
Choking baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to being that one and done
But girl you got that (get right)
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, they put you to bed
They ain't trying to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm coming baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup
H-Town
Oh yeahhhh
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup
cup, cup
