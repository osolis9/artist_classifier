Uh, Felli Fel, Ne-yo, Yeesy, Calm Down, Easy, Easy.
Keep Tellin' Me You Got A Man,
But He Can't Do What I Can,

Keep Show'in You The Miner Thing,
Let Me, Show You The Finer Thing,
Let Me, Show You What You been Missing,

Right About This Time Raise Your Glasses,
What's My Modivation, That Ass is,
Start A Conversation, Like As If,
You Really Want To Know About A Day In That Shit,
Go Ahead And Tell The Dj To Play Swizz,
So I Ain't Gotta Tell These Hoes Who I Is,
Bitches Hatin Again That's Music Too Me Ear's,
What's You Think My Fuel Was For All Of The Years?
Im Inspired When People Don't Like Me,
They Keep Me Writing So Exciting,
Man, The Drama Is So Intising,
I Might Just Bite ''A'' Mutherfucker Like Tyson,
Just Too Fly'ed A Mutherfucker So Change,
Throw Your Cash, That's Cake And Ice'in,
I Ask'ed Her You Buying?
She Said No Just sight seeing,
Maybe That's Just Because You Ain't Found The Right Thing? Yeah!

Keep Tellin' Me You Got A Man,
But He Can't Do What I Can,
Let Me, Show You What You Been Missing,
Keep Show'in You The Miner Thing,
Let Me, Show You The Finer Thing,
Let Me, Show You What You been Missing,

Let Me Show You What Is Like Too Be The Wife
Of A Nigga With A Life,
That Make Your Head Spin Around,
See It's Funny Because I Know What You Like,
But I Be See'in You With Nigga's That Ain't Right, Round Hard Top,
Know'in That You Really, Really Want's Your Top Down,

We Don't Live Twice, Only Life Once,
And I Know You Like Nice,
So How You Gone Front On Me?
Baby, Im The Boss JD,

He Buy Car's,
I Write You Poetry,
He Send Flowers,
I Send Mercedez,
Like Ye Said, having it ain't everything, not having it IS,
And Yes, I Guess, Im Into Trickin Off biz,
But Shit, If You Had It Like I Got It,
And You Got It As A Kid,
You Say The Same Thing To A Girl,
That I Just Said

Keep Tellin' Me You Got A Man,
But He Can't Do What I Can,
Let Me, Show You What You Been Missing,
Keep Show'in You The Miner Thing,
Let Me, Show You The Finer Thing,
Let Me, Show You What You Been Missing,

The Life I Live, Fit For A King,
Now All I Need, Fine Little Dime That's Sharin My Shine, You Sit Back And Watch The Haters Go Blind,

Now I'm Tryna Keep The Losses Too A Minimum,
If You Associating Binnen Em with Winnin Em, Then I say I Win Nine Out Of Ten Of Them,
Frankly I No Binnen Them And I Like Spendin Them,
You Like The Smooth And Can White Linnen Them,
You Wan't A Thug, Hey I Look Good In A Timb,
You Might Win Some, But Everybody Lost One,
I Put A Check On That Like Airforce One's,
It's Easier To Lose Her Then To Find Her, So Wine Her And Dine Her, And Treat Her To The Finer, Things, Lines, From The Top Designers,
Bling, Shine, Like You Tryn'a Blind Her,
These Are Just Reminder's,
Just Too Sign ''Her'',
Show Her You Find ''Her'',
Eight, One Of A Kind ''Her'',
See Alot Of Ass, Buy That One Behind Her!
Let's Just Say That Im Diggin That Like A Miner, Ya Digg

Keep Tellin' Me You Got A Man,
But He Can't Do What I Can,
Let Me, Show You What Your Missing,
Keep Show'in You The Miner Things,
Let Me, Show You The Finer Thing,
Let Me, Show You What You Been Missing,

KanYe, NeYo, JD, Low So, Felli Fel On The Track,
All The Hater Take Two Step's Back. And We Gone!
