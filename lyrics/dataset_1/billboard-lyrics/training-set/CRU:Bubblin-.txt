I be that lay back loungin' from the Lafayette Ave.
Talkin' mad lip an' shit that ain't my style
Makin' mad chips an' I shall proceed
An' I gets busy, that's word to my seed, what seed?

The seed to my H Y dro an' the big Y O
Gonna keep it fly though
An' Yog, don't sleep, playas be yawnin'
Wakin' up French kissin' duck tape the next mornin'

See, it's time to pay dues, deliver the news
Like you mass, we re-fuse to loose
Rhymes an' booze, the life we choose
Fight with the mic like Muslims an' Jews

No shame in our game, things stay the same
Niggas try to front, we ain't with the flame
Never take the blame, too much game
In the concrete jungle, our minds untamed

You can clap your hands, the hands, you clap
If your girl's in the club, it's your girl I'm at
If you don't know, check the sound
I am from the boogie down

The Rhythm Blunt CRU, The CRU's Rhythm Blunt
Hangin' niggas from his Versace, don't front
Got big booty bitches but they ain't for sale
With them big juicy lips like Rochelle, for real

As I'm makin' funky tracks with my main man, Taj
An' I gotta get a mil' so Shah can make the Haj
I'm smart but not Maxwell, the demo's on the Maxell
Then print the jam on wax is a back an' watch the Waxell
I swell, Latin Kings like gorilla fam be like damn
Yogi's comin' through Chad, my man

Rippin' microphones off hyper tones are the slow ones
Then we about when our flow's done
Bust you down like the last cigarette
Rhythm Blunt CRU, we the best shit yet

Aye, yo, I used to begin love with the girl named E Bridget
Had a crush on Puffy, fat ass like a midget
Rollin' with them kids, call 'em 'Uptown cosa nostra'
Goin' state to state in a hoopta Testarosa

I said, "Oh, Bridget, baby, know you drive me crazy
When I see your body. you astound an' amaze me"
She said, "Yogi bear. I ain't nothin' but trouble
Keep me on the low, I'll see you when you bubble"

Yo, I want the kingdom, the power an' the glory
The whole story is gettin' money an' livin' honky dory
Plenty, y'all fall, any an' all quickly
Known to turn lezzbo strictly dickly

Crushin' like a wreckin' ball when it fall
I reckon y'all on a nigga, then give it its all
Just give me some cash 'cause life is troublin'
1 2, 1 2, let's start bubblin'
