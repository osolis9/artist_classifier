We sing 1 an a 2 and a 3 and 4!
Born Jamericans
About your door!

Well Jamaica is an island me seh under the the sun
ah na dessa mi born
but mi heritage from
Washington where we livin' ah the heart of Babylon
No one elese can sing the yardcore song (sing along)

Yardcore de people want more
A nuttin less an' a nuttin more
Yardcore

Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e de people want more!
Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e yardcore de people want more!

North and the west
And they wantin' more
People of the world want more yardcore
People of the world you know i'm talkin' to you
So, here we see that light of day
We'll always pave the way
For the chorus to remain the same
Even thought it might not happen right now
But we know that it won't be long
Cuz our vibes are just too strong
We will endure for sure
People of the world want more yardcore

Not an accident
Just a new revelation
Yardcore movement across the nation
Just slide n wind reggae hip hop combine
Some a dem a still, can't catch my style!
Whoa.! Who could it be.where is it from
Original boom lick from the born jamericans
So act like ya know
And move your thing in tow
Come catch the vibe from the next stage show
In the high resolution i'm talkin' color quality
In 1973 began my DJ's degree
After 22 years I build my lyrical career
Yardcore is how I spend my career

Jamaica is an island under the the sun
On it's depths we are born
Washington where we livin' are the north of Babylon
No one elese can sing the yardcore song

Yardcore de people want more
A nuttin less an' a nuttin more
Yardcore

Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e de people want more!
Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e yardcore de people want more!
North and the west
And they wantin' more
People of the world want more yardcore
And no it ain't nuthin' new
People of the world you know i'm talkin' to you

So, doesn't seem that long away
'till we see that shinin' day
Cuz now and then
You can hear some real reggae music in some airplane
But we know it won't be long
Cuz our vibes are just too strong
We will endure for sure
People of the world want more yardcore

We have permission to oppose with our musical souls
Pushing the maximum let them all behold
Movement from the rebels moving to another level
And some of them cease and some of them seckle
Sing a sing and bring my style again
An i'm lucky to way
And the essence is in J.A.

It's all about giving peopl more then what they bargained for
To keep them rocking on from dust till dawn
On and on the dance floor
I said Yardcore it is something more
It is something more
From shore to shore

If you dance all for for
I said you push up your pants
Cuz we all maintain that you dance to tradition
But some of them feel
Closer to feel you don't know the deal

Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e de people want more!
Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e yardcore de people want more!
