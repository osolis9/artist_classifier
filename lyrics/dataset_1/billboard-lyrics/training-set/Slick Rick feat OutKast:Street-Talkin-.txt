Street-Talkin-:Slick Rick feat OutKast:22:1999-05-01

Don't try to claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and Outkast is on this jam
What kid? Diamond on the 2-2 grand
Trying to help raise all youth to man
Slick the ruler rick, his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

Outkast and Slick, the answer is in it
Hon' you need to get your ass on the dance floor this minute
We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks
Show your ass, move your fuck out, we're mad smoove snots
La-di-da-di, mmm, we like to party
Don't make me get money and platinumize my body
With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love
Blind folks be like, somebody turned the lights off

Immense rep, poppin' out a muffin
Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin
At the real estate, behavin' type choosy
Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please
Got the kid like watch your manners
Since I came out of jail, it's like the planet gone bananas
Lack of strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin' at me all stink, I had to tell her that

Don't try to claim things I haven't earned honest, man

Uhh, I went from player's ball to bulldoggin'
From bulldoggin' to bowhoggin'
Now bowhoggin' and pimpwalkin'
That strictly fresh and street talkin'
And we all last like that there
Ruin them all up like cat hair
We never fall off like hat wear
We some of the dopest MC's out there
Now eat that, Outkast and Ricky D, bitch can you beat that?
Remember the time I laid them down to teenage love now see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens

Shuckin' and jivin' was never the style
I'm gon' keep on beatin' this line
Spittin' that king shit, you cling shit
A tailor and a seamstress
New gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction 'coz I need it, hip-hop is that I be that
Like a junkie showin' your monkey, 'coz I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it, fold you up like you was pleated
Like some slacks and, relaxin', be strollin' like some cats then
I got a, baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin'
Not trappin', B-boy, but rappin', huh

Seems everybody's open off the grammar
The white fox pink velvet suit, white cabana
Listen baby girl, genius rick ta
Dreamboat wish, you shoulda been clicked picture
(Check her out)
I don't know what you're tryin' to figure out
Down south, barbecue ribs fly out a nigga mouth
And touchin' me the chosen, for such a will opposin'
Me and Big Boi tryin' to give our children clothing

Smokin' love, do we provide dope enough?
Even people unborn kid wide open off
The enginin' I'm sendin' in
Even make construction workers start actin' kind of feminine
(Hi)
10%'ll blast this hit from me and Big Boi
Who represent the Outkast click
A jealous cat, lack of strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin' at me all stink, had to tell her that
