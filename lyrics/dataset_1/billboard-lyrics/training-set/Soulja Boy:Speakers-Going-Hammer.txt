Speakers-Going-Hammer:Soulja Boy:24:2010-12-18

I wake up early in the morning
Round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassup)
And I'm all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?

My speakers out of space like ET.
Cops watch me all day like TV.
SOD hit da club we be so deep.
Mine on D and I grind like a OG
I got 12 diamond chains like a Ozzy
Follow me like de wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cuz it is so mean
Ask about me in da streets I spit so heat
Aint nobody in da game messing with my click
Style swift hot like itz july 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn't
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin money over here hands in the air
Ya'll making it too easy!, it's not fair

I wake up early in the morning
Round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassupp)
And I'm tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got ma speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer

Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?

I remember back in the days mayne I was broke
These days soulja tell em run a hundred spokez
No joke, mayne I'm balling out the atmoshphere
Say you ball harder then me, man get em outta here
I gotta my speakers going hamm in my Lamborghini
Two door coupe, girl in bikini
Passenger seat and she five star she so swagg
She so fabolous they way she throw it in the bag
Its young soulja soulja mayne I swear I'm popping tags
Back then, u could catch me in a poniac
Theese days droptop phantom with a 100 stackz
Yea they buy this album but they want they money back
Girls wet like they living in a fish tank
I'm getting money man what the fuck a bitch think
Young soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer
Like Rick Ross bitch I think I'm MC Hammer

I wake up early in the morning
Round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbours like wassup(say wassup)
And I'm all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got ma speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
Speakers going hammer, bammer bammer bammer
Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer?
