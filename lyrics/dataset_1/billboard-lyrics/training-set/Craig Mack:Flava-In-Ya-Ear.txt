Flava-In-Ya-Ear:Craig Mack:1:2001-07-28

"yo mack i don't even understand how they didn't understand you in
That mary joint!"
"yeah i know man."
"kick that ol' robotic futuristic george jetson crazy joint!"

Just... like... uniblab robotic kickin' flab
My flavor be the badder
Chitter chatter
Madder than the mad hatter (1)
I bet you my shit come out fatter
Got the data
To turn your body into antimatter (2) {...body into antimatter...}
And just like a piece of sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach
With the eggs and grits between {...take 'em down, mack...}
The king is what i mean
I mean
My man get a cup
And put some change inside your hand {...take 'em down, mack...}
Now hold up,
Let's make this official {...make it official}
Everybody let's agree that m.c.'s need a tissue {.wake 'em up}
The funk's my only issue,
I bet your mama miss you
And i bet the mack take off like an m.x. missile
No more of your whining
On the charts climbing
As i make the funk
Kickin' out more harder than a diamond {...harder than a diamond}
And if you didn't know who's rhyming
I guess i'm gonna say craig mack
With perfect timing

.you won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear {...kick it down!}

Chorus:
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
{...brand new flava in ya ear...}
[time for new flava in ya ear]

I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

[mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]

Craig mack
1000 degrees
You'll be on your knees
And you'll be burnin', beggin' please
Brother freeze! {boy!...}
Man's indisputed
And deep-booted
Funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad m.c.
With stamina like bruce jenner(3)
The winner
Tasting m.c.'s for dinner
You're crazy like that glue {...you're crazy, boy, you're crazy.}
To think that you
Could out-do
My one-two
That's sick like the flu {...shake 'em down, mack}
Boy, i flip
Boy all the time, 'cause
Boy, the rhyme you're kickin' {haaaaaaaaa! boy!...}
Ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition
In this rap world expedition
You come around,
I'll knock you out [of] position {... knock 'em out!}
No flav
Could ever dig a grave
For the mack
The power pack
In black
Makin' cement crack {...make it crack...}

.and here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
{here- comes- the- brand- new- flavor-...
[time for new flava in ya ear]
...in- your- ear...
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
...boy!}
[mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
{flavor down...}
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
{flavor, flavor, here comes the flavor}
[time for new flava in ya ear]

I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

[mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
{flavor in ya ear, boy...}

Haaaaaaa!
The mack's dope
With more hope than your pope
But for m.c.'s more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down
Down-breakin'
Forsaken
Lords of m.c.'s shakin
With this track that my man's makin'
M.c.'s will run like a bomb threat
I bet {what?}
Or better yet {huh?}
Make you sweat
Gettin' hotter than the sun get {yup!}
Craig mack is the flav that romps
From here to tibet {boy!}
I break all rules
With my action
That the mack sends
To m.c.'s stop relaxin'
This brand new sherrif that's in town's
Gettin' down
Leavin' bodies buried in the ground {...rest in peace...}
I set up rhymes for a decoy
To off a bad boy {ooohhhh!}
Watch the m.c.'s i destroy and... {boy!}

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
{time for new flavor...
[time for new flava in ya ear]
...fla-vor!}
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
{time for the flav...
[mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
...boy, here come the mack}
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
{haaaaaa!...
[time for new flava in ya ear]
...wakin' up with flavor!}
I'm kickin' brand new flava in ya ear

[mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...]
{haaaaaaaa!... boy...}
