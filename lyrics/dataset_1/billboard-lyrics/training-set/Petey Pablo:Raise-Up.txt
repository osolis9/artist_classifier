Or should I say members of the hip-hop community

(Aiyyo go get my homeboys)
And has teamed up with Timbaland, outta VA
(We gonna blow this up)
In a quest to redeem his title
And bring, North Carolina, and Virginia, to the front of the line
(Yeah, we gon' do it)
We're gonna stand by

Black with the bars from the front to back
And got a button in the middle, make the trunk go "eh-eh"
But it ain't 'bout that
It's about gettin' whatchu gettin' and drivin' all back here

You remember them days y'all, we used to play y'all
The radio and put our own lil' part in the song y'all
We used to
(Rep our city, rep our city!)
Runnin through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off

My house, my home, my hood
(Hah!)
My brother, my sister, my cous'
(Hah!)
My niggaz that was there from the beginin'
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggaz just glanced at it, now I gotcha starin' at it
But it's been the same ol' North Carolina it's been bein'
Y'all niggaz just gettin' it, oh it's a shame isn't it?
Oh you thought we said we were comin' wit a whole lotta somethin'
We were bullshhh!

Just incase you were one of the ones
Who wanted to come and ask somethin' stupid
(What you think you doin'?)
What it look like?
Puttin' it down for my niggaz in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bity overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses,
Ain't nothin' but a T.T. blast
That we got comin' atcha
(Beat)
Slammin'
(First)
Classic
(Gold for this)
What's after platinum?
(Baby you don't want the bomb)
And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills
These streams and N.C. outta the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
And tell 'em, "I told ya"

Hey look, this is David Nevermind
I'm signing off, but before I'm outta here, remember

North Carolina and V.A are definitely at the front of the line
You have my vote of support, over and out
