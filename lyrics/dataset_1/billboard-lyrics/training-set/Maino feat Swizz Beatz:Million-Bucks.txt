Million-Bucks:Maino feat Swizz Beatz:21:2009-08-22

I think I might give away a million bucks
I think I might give away a brand new truck
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Hey, I think I might take you on a shoppin' spree
You in the club, goddamn all drinks on me
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Good Lord, look what a beautiful day
My enemies ain't here, they gone away
I feel good, everythin' is okay
I feel like givin' all my money away

'Cause niggas is broke and there ain't no bread in the hood
Look what they did, they sendin' Feds in the hood
I ain't going to change, I'm coming back through the hood
Do what I do then back to the hood

I'm blessed, went places I never been
I live to see a black president
I'm good, yes I feel good, drinks on me
Baby what's good?

I think I might give away a million bucks
I think I might give away a brand new truck
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Hey, I think I might take you on a shoppin' spree
You in the club, goddamn all drinks on me
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

For the ones who got more than one mouth to feed
Gas so high got em' riding on E
Daddy needs shoes and kids gotta eat
They can have every last penny on me

Me and Swizzy rollin' in the Lambo
Sit back reminiscin' when I never had no dollas
Pride is well, poor dear mama
Stuck to the fight like a drained out boxer

So I know what it feels like to not have much
I should give away what I made last month
'Cause I gotta a lot to feel good about
I think I'ma give away a good amount

I think I might give away a million bucks
I think I might give away a brand new truck
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Hey, I think I might take you on a shoppin' spree
You in the club, goddamn all drinks on me
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

One shot for my niggas in the state pen
Two shots for my niggas still hustlin'
I feel good, I'm so good
Man, I rose from the bottom and it feels good

I'm a introduce to you a new dance
It's called the money dance
You pull the money out your pocket like this
You put your hands in the air like this and you simply just umm

Bounce, throw it all around
Throw it all around, throw it all around
Throw it all around a little more now
Throw it all around a little more now
Throw it all around

I think I might give away a million bucks
I think I might give away a brand new truck
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good

Hey, I think I might take you on a shoppin' spree
You in the club, goddamn all drinks on me
'Cause I feel good, yeah I feel good, 'cause I feel good
