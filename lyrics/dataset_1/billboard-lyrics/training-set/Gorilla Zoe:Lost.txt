Lost:Gorilla Zoe:10:2009-03-28

Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world, a labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be no

I ask them no questions, they give me no answers
Following the wise but they're walking in Pampers
Give me a cigarette, smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away but I still have no answer

I'm lost on the road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind, losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving on and off the road

I'm lost on the road
But survival is a must, don't know who I can trust
I'm living in a rush, I don't understand this fuss
My brain is 'bout to bust

I think I'm losing it, I might be losing it
I just might lose, am I losing my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue 'fore I run out of time

Am I losing it? Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing, I'm losing my mind
Am I losing it? Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing, I'm losing my mind

I-I-I'ma need counseling
I lost my mind and still haven't found it
I used to be so well-rounded
But now I tiptoe on hell's boundaries

F-F-F. Baby a.k.a. Crazy
Trapped in a maze, therefore I am amazing
Block E the doc, I'm just a patient
And even with navigation

I'm lost on the road
I-I-I don't know what's wrong with me
But but I'ma keep that styrofoam with me

I'm lost on the road
And I, and I don't know what's wrong with me
Gorilla Zoe on the song with me
He must be gone with me

I-I-I think I'm losing it, I might be losing it
I just might lose, am I losing my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue 'fore I run out of time

Am I losing it? Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing, I'm losing my mind
Am I losing it? Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing, I'm losing my mind

I'm making this money just to go spend it
Living the good life, hope nobody ends it
But who are you kidding? Ay who are you lying to?
You know if they want you best believe they will find you

I'm lost on the road
And there's no one to talk to
There's nowhere to run to, I'm going in circles
I'm talking to myself, got me blazing this purple

And I think I'm losing it, I might be losing it
I just might lose, am I losing my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue 'fore I run out of time

Am I losing it? Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing, I'm losing my mind
Am I losing it? Am I losing it?
I think I'm losing, I'm losing my mind

I'm lost on the road
I'm lost on the road

I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving on and off the road
I'm losing my mind
