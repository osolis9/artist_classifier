Aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit
Pop a little bit

Aye get fucked up
Drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit
Pop a little bit

Aye get fucked up
We ain't doing much
Tryna have a good time
Got 4 bad bitches
Man the pleasures all mine
Girls kissin' girls
Best believe they all fine
Girls kissin' girls
Best believe they all fine

Let go, let go
Let go, let go

What you doin'?
Drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit
Pop a little bit
Aye get fucked up

Drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit
Pop a little bit
Aye get fucked up

4 bad bitches
Man the pleasure all mine
We ain't doin' nothing
Tryin' to have a good time
Roll around the city, porsche seats on recline
4 bad bitches
Fuckin' at the same time
Bitch named keisha, got an ass like a bubble
Feed her M&M;'s watch it turn to some trouble
Two hands on the ball, shorty just double
Once I get mine
I ain't trying to cuddle
All in the party,
Hippy trippy on the henny
Jar full of weed,
Baby girl I got plenty
Break fast for the chick
Like I work at Denny's
Shawty where the shots
I need many, many, many, many
Molly in the system
Drinkin' out the bottle
Shorty goin' in
Going hard full throttle
Instagram likes got her feeling like a model
If you looking' for the drugs, don't worry I got em

Drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit
Pop a little bit
Aye get fucked up

Shot number 4 got her still talking sober
Molly got her ass wide awake no folgers
Aye what it is Diego bring the Doja
One more shot I'm in that hole like a gofer
Smoke, smoke, smoke
Drink, drink, drink
Bitch I'm Getting money
Give a damn what you think
One more shot, hella bent, might faint
Super lit hit it hoe
Going hard in the paint

Fruit rolling up he ain't ran out of yet
Boutta take off, my migos offset
Rolled up the blunt, got a dutch full of shrek
Said that she want more
Guess she ain't done yet
Green Green Green
Mean Mean Mean
Bad bitch kissin'
I ain't tryin' to intervene
If you gone do it
Baby do it for the team
And it's on blowing strong
Money long, Limousineee
