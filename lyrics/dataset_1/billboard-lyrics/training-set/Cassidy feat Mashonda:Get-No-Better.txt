The sun that shines above I think I'm in love
'Cuz every time I look in your eyes they be dumb bright
Like the sunlight when I look in the sky
And you always look fly, you stay with a mean outfit and
Got shoes that didn't even come out yet

Always got your your nails done
Always got yourself fixed you da type of chick I
Can see me going out wit and I ain't knockin' yo
Hustle but you should be somebody's wifey icey
Wit a rock on your knuckle and we would look hot
As a couple 'cuz you shaped so beautifully and
You are most cute as me

Respect yourself girl it's whatever I get da
Cheddar when we get together it don't be no better

And you can see I'm throwin' it 'cuz my arm
