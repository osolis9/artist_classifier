Marvin-Chardonnay:Big Sean feat Kanye West & Roscoe Dash:4:2011-12-24

Yeah
No, nigga, you don't really wanna take this cool off
Boi, thug

She got me early in the mornin' when she's all alone
I'ma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood
Girl, I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Yeah, yeah

She love the way I'm doin' it, do it
So good, she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is you the finest
Gave you a new name

What's that, what's that, what's that?
My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there

Let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it
Marijuana every mornin'
And Patronin', girl, we groanin'

The pussy got me feelin' like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on, on?
You know, I got it goin' 'til it's

Early in the mornin' when she's all alone
I'ma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood
Girl, I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

So just let the song play the long way
The strong way, it's our day, it's our way
This was all inspired by
A little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up

Talk to the, talk to the hand
You talkin' to a grown ass man
It's like way, way, way too much in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
There goes the bed sheet

Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off 'cause I'm rappin' my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fuckin' anthem, get it, the fuckin' anthem

Early in the mornin' when she's all alone
I'ma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood
Girl, I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

So just let the song play the long way
The strong way, it's our day, it's our way
This was all inspired by
Little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

I don't really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you're blazin'
And I swear you turn at least Half-Asian
And we 'bout to have a liaison
She so cool, gives head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cap on
And it's just so amazin', so amazin', so amazin'

Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I'm speed racin'
Leave 'em with me, it'll boost your reputation
Westside is where I'm stationed

Spend all night just Champagne tastin'
Ain't no rest, girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

Early in the mornin' when she's all alone
I'ma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood
Girl, I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

So just let the song play the long way
The strong way, it's our day, it's our way
This was all inspired by
Little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

And this was all inspired by
A little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
