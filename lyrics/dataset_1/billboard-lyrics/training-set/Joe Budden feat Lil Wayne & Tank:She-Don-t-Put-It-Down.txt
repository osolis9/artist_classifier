She-Don-t-Put-It-Down:Joe Budden feat Lil Wayne & Tank:25:2013-03-02

She ainâ€™t got a leg to stand on
Donâ€™t even trip

I can take you all over the world though, even tell you pack light
The last lad couldnâ€™t even get a cab ride
She donâ€™t do the blogs, but if she did, sheâ€™d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that Iâ€™m always on her bad side
Uh, now she donâ€™t ever stress me â€™bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned with other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, itâ€™s my turn, that shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why Iâ€™m always tryna wear her out
She donâ€™t ride like you, no she donâ€™t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick, uh
And Iâ€™m telling yâ€™all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made up
She kill â€˜em in Leviâ€™s, see why, it ainâ€™t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear, how could other women compare
They canâ€™t

I done put another in your space
Damn if they do, itâ€™s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Ainâ€™t nobody fucking with ya
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you

I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch, I miss you like a deadline
And the girl Iâ€™m with is just the girl Iâ€™m with
I mean itâ€™s working out, so weâ€™re staying fit
But you know love is nothing, ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy, crash test
You be fucking that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga, he canâ€™t fuck with me
Iâ€™m Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back
But given night, Iâ€™d still pop that ass like a Prozac
Girl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me and I know ya still for me
Thatâ€™s why we still fucking, cause she donâ€™t put it down like you

I done put another in your space
Damn if they do, itâ€™s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Ainâ€™t nobody fucking with ya
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you

Looking â€™round mine, no downtime, see nothing else even matters
Canâ€™t even walk slow through that mall, cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off, like Iâ€™m sleeping with the clapper
Still she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How Iâ€™m sexing her, making likes of hers, no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to desperate
Climb with the former rather ladder, you already know which one Iâ€™d rather
Cum on

I done put another in your space
Damn if they do, itâ€™s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Girl you working with the killer
Ainâ€™t nobody fucking with ya
She donâ€™t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She donâ€™t put it down like you
