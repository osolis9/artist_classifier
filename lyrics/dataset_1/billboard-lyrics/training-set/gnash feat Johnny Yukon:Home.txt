Doesn't matter where we are
We are never far apart, no
Doesn't matter where we go
When I'm with you I am home
Yeah, I am home

I think it was last year on my birthday when you broke the news
Things ain't rollin' how we need them to and we have to move
But I said, "Dad, get those moving boxes out the room"
And cut the cake, I'll get it, I got it, I'll give my all for you
Too many memories and feelings I'm not down to pack
So lately I've been putting all this weight up on my back
I know that's never what you wanted dad, but understand
We can't afford another heart attack to keep the fam in tact
It's whatever as long as we stick together
This shit's forever, above us there's nothin' better
Do you remember when you said "Do what you love
And don't give up, it's in your blood"
That's when you taught me
If all I have is me, then all I need is family
If all I have is home, then all I am is happy
I may don't know at all but I know this
Home isn't where you are, it's who you're with and it
Doesn't matter where we are
We are never far apart, no
Doesn't matter where we go
When I'm with you I am home
Yeah, I am home

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I'm with you I am home
Yeah, I am home

No matter where we go, we'll call it home
So no matter whee we go, we're not alone
Why fix something if it isn't broke?
You call it holding on, I call it hope
I'm not tryna make my sister move or tryna change my momma's mood
So I got all this shit to do to make sure movin's not the move
'Cause lately I've been feeling all this pressure within
But one day we gon' all be back together again
So for now I'm on my grind, workin' all the time
Sending all these dollars, dimes to you
When I'm out there on the road, you can always hit my phone
So I'm always right there next to you
Now I'm missin' all these birthdays
Just to put my family in a good place
'Cause that's all that i wanted in the first place
'Cause I only do it for my family
So we good because...
When I get it all, I'mma give it all to you
And when I get it all, I'mma give it all to you
And know I did it all, yeah I did it all for you
When I'm with you I am home
Yeah, I am home

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I'm with you I am home
Yeah, I am home
