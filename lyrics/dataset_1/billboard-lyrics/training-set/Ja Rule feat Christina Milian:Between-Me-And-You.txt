Murder Inc. shit

Uh...uh, uh, uh

Chorus: 

The secret little thing that we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Let's keep between me and you

The secret little thing that we do
Should be between me and you
The freaky things that we do
Let's keep between me and you

Yo...

Now when I first met her
All i thought was...thong, thong, thong
Like loser lang we can get our freakin on
Baby you know the game slipped away
Slide me your number
It's the last day of spring, see ya first day this summer
I'm a bad motha...shut yo mouth
Pull the drop out
Creep at a low speed
Cuz homey probably know me
I push the peddle
Thought to yours to let em 
Way up in the air like i think he's here
Cuz see, every time that i'm alone with you
Homey be checkin' up on you
But if that nigga only knew
You've got a lot of freak in you, babyyy
When that startin' to rain
I pop the roof and the champagne
How jay said? "money ain't a thing"
It's been close to few
Something even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, babyyy

Chorus:

Girl it's on again
Every year..we hummer 'em in
Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends  
And when the..day ends 
That's when it all begins
You wit him..here's my room key (holla at me)
Why ya thinka thinka i'm gon' hit it up
Then look at the nigga ya thinkin' ya love (c'mon love)
We could go there, me and you
Free for, for a night
If ya love it
In the mornin', awake with new light
If i lookin' like i ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my bizzz
It is what it is
Nigga livin' his life
And that's my bitch
Ya know i gotta wife
Let's keep this thing tight, babyyy

Chorus:

Dont' let the word get out (shhh), babyyy
This is..strictly between me and you, babyyy
If they..new we were doing what we were doing
It'd probably ruin our pre-rent way summer in cancoon-an and I
Love the way we get away
Throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
Fuck life, we live life, this is our life, live your life
See, every time that i'm alone with you
Shorty be checkin' up on you
But if baby girl only knew
You've got a lot of freak in you, babyyy
Did i ever tell you, my man love what you do
That little thing with your tongue
You the best, who knew?
It's been close to few..at times even impossible
But..it's been between me and you, babyyy

Chorus:
