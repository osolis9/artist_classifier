Lifestyle:Rich Gang feat Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan:3:2015-01-10

I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga living life like volcano and this only the beginning
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffing on clouds and niggas still beginning

Million 5 on the Visa card
Hundred bands still look like the fucking tires
Nigga serving great white like I'm feeding sharks
I won't do nothing with the bitch, she can't even get me hard
Something wrong with the pussy
Even though I ain't gong hit it, I'ma still make sure that she douche it
Me and my woadie, we don't get caught up like that, no way
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J
(Who said money?)
Hop up in my bed full of forty bitches and yawning
Hey, this a show bitch you performing
I do this shit for my daughters and all my sons, bitch
Im a run up them bands, I'll take out their funds, bitch
I got a moms bitch, she got a moms bitch
I got sisters and brothers to feed
I ain't goin' out like no idiot, I'm a OG

I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga living life like volcano and this only the beginning
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffing on clouds and niggas still beginning

Still screaming "Fuck the otherside"
I'ma ride for my niggas, aye
And I'ma die for my niggas, aye
Ain't gonna be latching on my niggas aye
Niggas couldn't see me if they had a genie
I'ma live my life like Bennie, R.I.P. my brother Bennie
I stack my racks to the ceiling, now these niggas can't beat me
I just might wake up in Chanel and these bitches can't see me
I'm in a whole other league
I ain't got aids but I swear to God I would bleed
'Til I D.I.E
28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E
Pee on top of these bitches
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me
I'm in that coffin with baby mommy getting sloppy toppy
I'm bleeding red like a devil, I see these bitches plotting
They wanna know how I got M's and I didn't finish college

I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga living life like volcano and this only the beginning
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffing on clouds and niggas still beginning

I do it for my daddy, I do it for my mama
Them long nights, I swear to God I do it for the come up
I'm Willie B beating on my chest, in the jungle, aye
Money on money, I got commas in every bank
Sunday through Monday I've been grinding with no sleep
Talking 'bout taking something from me, like no way
Thugger Thugger, that's my brother, brother
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle knuckle
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punching on the gas, too fast, and I lose yah
Give me a bed, I'll do her, I want a head, Medusa
I swear a nigga gone cause this strong I'm blowing super
Grinding for a new day
I'm skating, like that nigga Lupe
Hey, I'm on the top just like toupee
Hey, I'm in her mouth just like toothpaste

I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga living life like volcano and this only the beginning
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffing on clouds and niggas still beginning
