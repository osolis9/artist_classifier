Pop-Bottles:Birdman feat Lil Wayne:6:2008-02-23

{Start with straight shots and then pop bottles} (ya) brrr
{Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models} (uh-huh) believe that
{Start with straight shots and then pop bottles} (ya)
{Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models}
Okay we poppin champagne like we won a championship game
(Look like I got on a championship ring)
Cuz I ball hard (no bitch we ball harder)
I am the Birdman (and Im the J.R.)

Okay start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Pour it on the models, shut up bitch swallow
If you cant swallow, shut up bitch gargle
Straight up out the water wit my Mark Jacob's goggles
Im fresher than a mufucka, yea Im a mufucka
No I wouldn't take ya girl but I should take her thong from her
Could you tell I love woman, like no other woman
Im sorry sweetheart, I thought you were my other woman

Now as I recline behind my desk
I aint got a lot of knifes but I got a lot of checks (money)
Got my own shoe brand new on the set
Went from sittin in a cell to sittin on a jet
From shittin on a cell to shittin on a jet
I lost too many friends but I won too many bets (too many bets)
I made too much money I aint made enough yet
So I scratch, and yes Junior is the best (shawty)
So many nggaz from my hood on they back
So many niggaz from ya hood on they back
Thats why we so paid and it be like that
I rather pop a bottle, befo I pop a gat

Yea, only sippin red champagne
White-tee red hat red bandana
Uptown, chopper fucks the pain
Fuckin wit the Birdman we choppin yo propane
Fuckin wit my son man we run up in ya mansion
Chopper make music, bitch start dancin
Stunna man back so you know the cirumstances
And Im cookin up the Carter 3 no advances (youngin)
All my cars automative automatic
No lie, we dont even drive no askin
Uptown we packin and we stackin (believe that)
Young Money Cash Money we the champion
