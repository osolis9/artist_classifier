No-Problem:Lil Scrappy:8:2004-11-20

It goin' down right here
Hold that nigga back You can, you can get crunk in the club
Roll, roll wit your hood, get stomped in the club
Or you could, you could get buck in the club
Get fucked up in the club, nigga, we don't give a fuck

But you don't, you don't want no problem, problem
But you don't, you don't want no problem, problem
But you don't want no problem with me
BME, we be filthy deep

You don't wanna be dead in the streets
Mouth, mouth full of blood an' soul full of heat
Why you, why you tryna act hard as hell?
Know, know damn well, you don't wanna feel the shell

Nigga, I've been down by the law
Gun to my head, pressed dead to the wall
I got big balls an' bullets like baseballs
Split ya dome, put you straight, knock out all y'all

Hell no, them boys don't play
Straight nuts to ya face, put ya pistol away
An' don't please weed, weed to my head
Pray, pray for the folks in the club gettin' scared
Got a problem with that?

You can, you can, crunk, crunk, club, club
Roll, roll, hood, hood, stomped, stomped in the club
You could, you could, buck, buck, club, club
Get fucked up in the club, nigga we don't give a fuck

But you don't, you don't, prob, prob, prob, prob
But you don't, you don't, prob, prob, prob, prob
But you don't, you don't wan' roll with me
BME, we be filthy deep

Hold 'em back, hold 'em back, fuck, fuck that nigga
Fuck that, hold 'em back, gotta push that nigga
Hold 'em back, hold 'em back, push, push that nigga
Fuck that, hold 'em back

Shawty, shawty, it's on, goddammit, it's on
Keep poppin' in my face an' get popped in the dome
Hey shawty, it's on, goddammit, it's on
Keep poppin' in my face an' keep poppin' in my face
Keep poppin' in my face an' get popped in the dome

Learn to rush muthafuckas, If a nigga fall, that's when shit gets worse
The problem with you niggaz is you just talk too much
Man, swing on a nigga an' fuck his ass up

An' you can walk on by with yo' nuts in a tub
I'll beat yo' block if you really won't get crunk
In the A, we don't play them games
We just stack an' slang an' load up them thangs
Gettin' buck if you wanna an' catch a bow
Keep yo' pretty ass girl, beat your ass an' take your hoe, nigga

You can, you can, crunk, crunk, club, club
Roll, roll, hood, hood, stomped, stomped in the club
You could, you could, buck, buck, club, club
Get fucked up in the club, nigga we don't give a fuck

But you don't, you don't, prob, prob, prob, prob
But you don't, you don't, prob, prob, prob, prob
But you don't, you don't wanna roll with me
BME, we be filthy deep

Yeah, man, this is the muh'fuckin' BME click
It's on
