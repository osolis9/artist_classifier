What-Is-It:Baby Bash feat Sean Kingston:12:2008-02-23

Bash, tell me, what it do
Tell me, what it do, Kingston
(What is it)
What, what, what is it
Hey, hey, hey, hey

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

I'm a holler back, then I pop my collar back
Girl, I see that da, da, da, dunk, I want all of that, follow that
Train man, follow that caboose
Ain't nathin' in the world like some thick and some juicy

She going downtown 'cause her favorite DJ's spinnin'
I'm all up in the door, so I'm already winnin'
I got a lot of women, but I'm way too choosy
And then I love my cake, like that Ricky love Lucy

On some peanut butter leather, with the wood so grainy
It must be raining dollars 'cause she lookin' so gravy
Sophisticated lady, pop it to the end, what it do, what the busi'
Baby girl, tell me what's happenin', what's happenin'?

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

She move like she dancing on YouTube
The kind of chica that you really ain't used to
Dame lo, dame lo, mami, shoot through
In my ear, talkin' 'bout, I'm a do you

Everyone top-notch it, everybody watch it
Ain't no punk, when she pop, lock and drop it
Straight show stop it, watching me perform
Got the Cyclone ring-tone on the phone

I feel it on my body, baby girl, I'm in the zone
Must be the goose mixed with a little 'Tron
She make it happen, Cap'n, feelin' on me
We in the billin' and we feelin' like wee

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

What, da, da, dang?
What, da, da, dang? Hey
What, da, da, dang?
What, da, da, dang? Hey
What, da, da, dang?
What, da, da, dang? Hey
Listen to the sound, everybody go

What, da, da, dang?
What, da, da, dang? Hey
What, da, da, dang?
What, da, da, dang? Hey
What, da, da, dang?
What, da, da, dang? Hey
Listen to the sound, everybody go

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it
