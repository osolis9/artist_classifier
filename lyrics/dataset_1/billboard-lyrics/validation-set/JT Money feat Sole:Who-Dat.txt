Yo, who dat off-brand nigga tryin' to hang wit the clique?
Flossin' like you came wit the clique
But would you bang with the clique if it was thick
Or do you just ride dick?
'Cause playa, I don't know you, nigga, tell me who you wit?

If you hang wit the Squad, you bound to get scarred
Sucker boys run they mouth, real niggaz run the yard
'Round here we blow trees, don't fuck with OBs

Uhh, me an' my girls rollin' deep, represent the Sole
Bunch of fly-ass bitches, when we ride it's on
See them niggaz all pause, droppin' digital phones
Askin' me, “Where you from?” 'cause they wantin' to clone

Niggaz, them lines, they spit, they want my shit
But game be whack? I turn my back
Then hear that you're lickin'it, stickin' it
Tell all your friends that you're dickin' it

Swingin' on them [Incomprehensible]
Hi-fi shit, nigga, get sick with this
Say, “Who dey? Who dat?”, no chance, blew dat
When you said that you wrote this
Have Red Zone niggaz on blow for this bitch

Don't you deny it, nigga, don't even try it, nigga
You makin' claims that you laid wit the fly, nigga
Don't know, your name, it still, remains
That you would say you fucked, Sole

Every time they turn a back, burn tracks
Niggaz wanna say they've earned stacks
Dick be jack, picture that
Say my name, I'm the one, who the fuck is dat? Why?

I been said a legendary up in this motherfucker
Veteran in this game an' still bringin' ruckus
Never had no time for tricks or no bustaz
I only fuck wit dat real, I got no love for suckers

All these tiny ass niggaz be wanna wear my shoes
Ain't got the slightest of clues or either paid your dues
Then these hoes goin' crazy 'bout J, baby
The way you show me your love is by the way you pay me

The game room been closed, so stay up out of mine
Just know, I keep niggaz up an' crunk like battle lines
Motherfuckers be all up in a nigga biz
Tryin' to question my shit just like a pop quiz
