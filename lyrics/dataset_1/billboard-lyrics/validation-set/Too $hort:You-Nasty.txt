You-Nasty:Too $hort:6:2000-12-02

Bitch
You nasty, you nasty, bitch
That's what I said, bitch
(You nasty)
I said you nasty
(You nasty)
Fuck that shit, fuck you hoes
Fuck all y'all, man
 (You nasty)

I used to get straight A's, read my books in Catholic school
Now I find myself in the men's bathroom
With a top-notch, goin' wild in the stall
She ain't even trippin' 'cuz she's havin' a ball

I used to play with my toys in the back yard
But now I just walk around and act hard
A lot of women like to be called a bitch
I'll break it down so you understand all of it

I always thought I was an educator
I might not love her but I never hate her
Shes the kind of girl who make your toes pop
Keep ya wide open, never need nose drops

Now y'all wanna get mad at me
For talkin' about another young, nasty freak
It's life, it's not a major catastrophe
You ain't a hoe 'cuz you givin' up the ass for free, you nasty

I know why y'all mad at me
I ain't break your heart, girl
 (You nasty)
Man, these bitches trippin'
 (You nasty)

Too many tight lil' dresses with no panties on
Too many females tryin' to take a man home
Where your mommy and your daddy at?
Just because a player got a Cadillac

You wanna lay in the back, with your face in his lap
All you gotta do is taste that
You get to ride, get used all the time
I ain't made the situation, I just made the rhyme

Adapt to my surroundings, look around
Nothin' but pimps, tricks and hookers found
In the Town, if you ain't one you the other
I ain't fooled, what you gonna do to a brother

Lookin' at me, like you wanna eat me
Didn't even have to use words to meet me
Now we havin' sex and I forgot your name
You just a hot thang, nothin' can't stop your game 'cuz you nasty

I already fucked you
 (You nasty)
I don't know why you trippin'
 (You nasty)
I told y'all I was gonna call you
 (You nasty)
After awhile

I understand where your anger comes from
'Cuz I've been talkin' bad on the mic since day one
Never took the time to explain myself
But keepin' it real is somethin' I can't help

I know some real women, I know some real hoes
And male-bashing songs, I don't feel those
But I'm glad you bi-sexual women came out
Don't tell 'em what we did and keep my name out your mouth

If it wasn't for the groupies or for the oral sex they gave me
I'd treat you all like ladies
I'm just a victim of society
Look me in my eyes and don't lie to me

You ever had a one-night stand and go to church the next day?
A full night of play, wake up and pray
Wishin' you could stay but you cain't
Oh, you a good girl today? You ain't no saint, you nasty

Oh, yeah, I know I fucked you too
 (You nasty)
Man, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
 (You nasty)
You need to take this muthafuckin' opportunity
 (You nasty)
And have some big fun
 (You nasty)

I got some drinkin' in the kitchen, baby
 (You nasty)
My niggas comin' through
 (You nasty)
Oh, it's cool girl
 (You nasty)
We gon' work this shit out, bitch

I ain't mad at y'all
I ain't mad at you
Shit, I ain't mad
'Cuz you nasty
