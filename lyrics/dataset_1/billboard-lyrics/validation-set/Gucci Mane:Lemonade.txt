Lemonade:Gucci Mane:8:2010-05-15

Yeah, it's Gucci, what's up, baby?
Yellow everything this time, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Yellow rims, yellow big-booty, yellow bones

Yellow rounds, yellow MP's
Yellow watch, yellow charm ring chain
Yellow livin' room set, lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl
It's Gucci, it's Gucci

My Phantom sittin' on sixes, no 20's in my denim
Your cutlass motor knockin' because it is a lemon
My rifle's Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches, I'm not fuckin' with 'em

I'm truly stupid paid that's just how I feel today
I'm movin' slow 'cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm sellin' lemonade
$600 a pint the going rate off in the A

Lemonade diamond bracelet put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimpin' where I'm winnin', that's just how I'm chillin'
I'm smokin' grits and sellin' chickens, Corvette painted lemon

It's Gucci

Lemon on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemon on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemon in the shade with my feet up
Lemon in the shade with my feet up

Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face watch 'em freeze up

I got lemonade and lemon tit, lemons watch me mix the shit
Lemonade complexion, East Australian girl be killin' me
She say I be killin' her, I say I be feelin' it
Four days then I'm sick of her 'cause her brain is lemonhead

Cocaine white exterior, interior lemonade
Yellow with the off-white trimming, I call that the super drank
Yellow diamond pinky ring, call that there the lemon rock
Jewelry box a lemon bin, my earring size an apricot

Yeah, I smoke that strong a lot, yeah, I need some what you got
Half a pound of lemon kush, call that pack the lemon drop
Canary yellow lemon watch, big bird yellow top
Yellow Polo, Polo slippers, white and yellow Polo socks

Gucci Mane be pumpin' dawg, he don't got all he say he got
Just stash one Lemon homie, I can supply them the 50 glocks
Yellow boat parked at the dock, yellow bone gone make the drop
Flip the flop mine up the top then go buy me a yellow yacht

It's Gucci

Lemon on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemon on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemon in the shade with my feet up
Lemon in the shade with my feet up

Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face watch 'em freeze up

Lemonade my town, said Miami I want yellow carpet
Woke up in the mornin', fuckin' bought a yellow Aston Martin
Yellow bricks, yellow dust, yellow link, yellow tusk
Yellow pills, spinnin' wheels, yellow weed, we up with us

Coward-ass nigga, yellow stripe, you a yellow back
AK hit your dog and you can't bring Old Yellow back
Yep, Gucci bang up eighty thousand that's a yellow set
Yellow homes, mellow homes, you know you a scary cat

No sleep for two days, so my pupils lookin' yellow
Five flights, six shows, quarter-million on my schedule
Bangladesh and Gucci Mane, niggas know they in trouble
Green ice, red light, caution Gucci rock yellow

Lemon on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemon on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemon in the shade with my feet up
Lemon in the shade with my feet up

Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup

Lemons in their face watch 'em freeze up
