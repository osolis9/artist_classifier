Margi' chain slide on lil shawty hit the side though
You get penalized, you come around, It ain't enough dough
Keep a bag of xannies if you tryna join the family
Got the sauce on me in this off white tanny
Puerto rican freakin' oh she sneakin', I done ordered up
She was goin' in the spur like a party bus
Pardon me, before I take a greed I never brag or boast
She ain't speak no inglo, but I know she like to tweak that coke
