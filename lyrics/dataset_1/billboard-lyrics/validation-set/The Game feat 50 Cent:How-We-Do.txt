How-We-Do:The Game feat 50 Cent:2:2005-06-11

This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club

This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
Fresh like, unhh, Impala, unnh

Chrome, hydraulics, 808 drums

You don't want, none, nigga betta, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum
Come get, some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white air, once
Since red, rum, ready here I, come
Compton, unh, Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin', "Unnh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, unh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna, stunt
I put Lamborghini doors on that Escolade
Lil pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year man, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me

I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best tre pound on my hip

Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good 'cuz I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cuz shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Dougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do

We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin' on bulbs
Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
Cali got niggaz in New York ridin' on hundred spokes

Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest

50, unh, Bentley, unh
'Em came 'n gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
Homie, it's game time, you ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months but Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit had niggaz like, "Huh?"
Don't try to front, I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head, lumped
Fifty got a, gun ready here he come
Gotta sick, vendetta to get this, chedda
Meet my Ba, retta the drama, setta
Sip am-a, retta my flow sounds, betta
Than average on tracks I'm a savage I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique
(G-Unit)
