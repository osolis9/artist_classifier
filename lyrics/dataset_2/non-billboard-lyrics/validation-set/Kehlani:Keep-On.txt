Keep-On:Kehlani
Anything you're saying to me right now
Probably have the right to say
Any crazy things you're feeling for me tonight
You can get it on out the way

Cuz I ain't been the best that I coulda been
I ain't do the shit that I shoulda did
But every time I come crawling on my knees
You're there

And you just keep on taking me back
And I don't know why you do
Cuz I'm no good to you
And you just keep on taking me back
In your open arms, maybe I belong
And you just keep on taking

You can yell and you can curse and call me a bitch
Probably have the right to do
You can tell the world that I'm a narcissist
I would think they'd listen to you

Cuz I ain't been the best that I coulda been
I ain't do the shit that I shoulda did
But every time I come crawling on my knees
You're there

And you just keep on taking me back
And I don't know why you do
Cuz I'm no good to you
And you just keep on taking me back
In your open arms, maybe I belong
And you just keep on taking

Me back, and I don't know why you do
Cuz I'm no good to you
And you just keep on taking me back
In your open arms, baby I belong
And you just keep on taking

I'm not taking you back
Oh no I'm not
No I'm
Taking me, you're taking me really back
No I'm, no I'm, no I'm, no I'm not
