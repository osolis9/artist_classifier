Yah, red light district music
Jon b welcome to the netherlands
I hear that cello
Look at this girl hiding behind the
Glass
Sometimes u can be so narcissistic,
Pessimistic, everything i taught u
Bout yourself
U missed it
Girl you're crazy its secret.
Rhinestone shower curtains
Sleeping in sequence
What r u a nut case nothing but a
But an waist, c-cups not enough
Insecure. Not demure. Not the pure
Woman that your daddy always
Hoped for u 2 be. Get with jon b
And be the cup of tear

Porcelin eyes that make u fall in a
Trance
U gave me a glance. Reintroduced
In the disco
Handle with care you're fragile
Stare off your look out
U see me you're so aware make u
Want get took down yeah
I know your kind
You're the type to be delicate like
China so high on a shelf in your
Mind
Its time to take u down and fill your
Cup up

Its written on your glazy eyes.
Don't where no disguise
Since u tipped your cup
I had to oblige
Take this from my gentlemen's hand's
Take sip's real slow
Sophisticated taste
Know u can go with my flow

I'm the moody blues
Pocket full of hundred, closet full of
Shoes
I get off the board. Get on the 1's and
2s
Go up against me reggie u ll lose
I keep the hood bobb'n like its on a cruise

Then i'm on the move
I'll be out before they put each other
On the news
I drink and i smoke 8uti don't lose my
Cool
I'm trouble free 0 g
That's what i choose
I'm in the glass, house countin'
Cheddar cheese
Turn my hundred spokes in for some
Double os
I used to move keys now i'm movin
These f-a-c-e s and g's
Get on my staff, your on my path
Hop up on the wrath,
Make your two friends laugh
Hit the jet ski
I get 'em wettski
I do the hat trick like i'm wayne gretski
(ladies)take me ta ta take me
This shelf is starting to shaking
Hot enough for the taken
U look thirsty i might get took by u
Porcelain doll baby
Antique and vintage lady
Fill me up to the rim. Come lace me
Straight shot no chaser taste so smooth

Girl it seems like a dream.
This is real
Take it off, loosen up, this your chance
Handle with care you're standin' still
But i know how u feel
Don't be shy, take my hand, we gon' dance
Cause your feet start movin' and u look
Like you're fee un' yourself
More precious, you're so fine,
U gon shine
My vibe hits ya like a whistle blowing
The top of the kettle
This is the time where i know your type
So well
