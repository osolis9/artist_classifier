Give-You-My-Heart:Unity Klan
Lord I give you my heart
I give you my soul
And I live for you alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord Have your way in me

Lord where you at
In the midst of trust
Its getting hard to pray & read
And so I struggle
Lord you always said that you'll never leave me
But As the devil keeps on temptin
Its getting hard to believe
Why cant I die, die to my flesh
Lord you know my heart, man I wants to do my best
I tried sex, drugs, money and the fame it felt good but at the end it always ended in pain
Lord You've always been there through the thick and thin.
So Lord can you please forgive a brother's sin
Spirit is winnin but the flesh wants to do wrong
But since Your word says Lord I gots to stay strong
Press on, keep going, hold on (Lord this is your song)
Lord you know I love you so
I give you my heart and I give you my soul
Take control Jesus and do what chu gotta do
Because is was your blood that dropped and you said I love you
I give you all that I am my heart, my soul, and my mind I just want to be a godly man.

Lord I give you my heart
I give you my soul
And I live for you alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord Have your way in me

Lord I give you my all
Give me the strength to never fall
When I'm down on my knees and start to call
All the pain in my heart begins to hurt
You took the life that was broken and made it work
Jesus what would I be without your love
All the power in the world is in your blood
Please Lord I need you to hold my hand
All the struggles in my life into your path
As a baby the devil tried to take my life
Abortion failed the mighty hand of Jesus Christ
I'm not worthy to be where I am right now
All I can do is go to your feet and bow
I wonder what did you see in me
My selfish ways gave me pain suffering and misery
Can you see this broken vessel
crying out to you without your presence by my side
What would I do
humbly I stand take who I am give me the grace in my mind
To help me understand I lay my life down at your feet please take it
Because only by your love and mercy can I make it (can I make it)


Lord I give you my heart
I give you my soul
And I live for you alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord Have your way in me

Lord you took me from the gutter
became my soul lover like no other
My friend closer than a brother
Since the baby born you had a plan for me
The blood of Calvary became real to me
You took me from the jail cell not the gates of heaven
And I reviled because greater is you who sent me than the one whose in the world
I give you my soul my Lord the blood on the cross the greatest story ever told
My heart belongs to you my life belongs to you
Gotta grow worthy of the calling sometimes I feel I'm falling
I wait for your grace to gets me
So I'm and its picks me up when I feel I cant make
when I feel cant take it gotta be real I cant
Fake it I know you see my heart
You gave me a new start now and I live and talk
Now I shine and walk
According to your word all the mess you put me through this is my desire
To hear my name before you one day
Miss the fire I've been sanctified sent apart and then after your own hear
like David were meant to worship you
Like David I feel the spirit of the Lord in my soul
and I let it flow
