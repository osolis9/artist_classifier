Ooh, look at you shine baby
Look at you shine, look at you shine, baby
Why don't you shine?
Look at you shine, baby, look at you shine
Look at you shine, baby, look at you shine, come on

Girl, why do you got that look on your face?
Time, is now girl I don't want to waste
You shocked my eye when you stepped in the place
I wanna get with that, baby

Now there's no way I can let
Let you get past me now, baby
I've scoped you now you're mine
It's time to let, let you shine, all night baby, yeah

Love, love, girl let me take you out
Show you around my town
Look at them starin' at you, baby
Tonight, girl you deserve some wine
Here's to you being so fly
Let me just let you shine now, lady

Girl, why do you got an empty glass in your hand
You got your girls but do you have a man?
I feel your vibe you look so good

Tonight, girl you deserve some wine
Here's to you being so fly
Let me just let you shine now, lady, yeah

Took the cup back, long legs, bare breasted
The type of body that got my mind manifested
Lyrical potion took me at the glance when I see you dance
Highlight from the light from the back

'Cause I, I love the way you make me feel
Got that sex appeal
So swing it over this way
Tonight I wanna make a long stay, cause I

Love, girl let me take you out
Show you around my town
Look at them starin' at you, baby
Tonight, girl you deserve some wine
Here's to you being so fly
Let me just let you shine now, lady

Just let you shine, na, na, na
Just let you shine, na, na, na
