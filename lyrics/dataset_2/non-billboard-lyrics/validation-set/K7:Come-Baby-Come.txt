Come-Baby-Come:K7
Bounce, come on, bounce
Bounce, come on, bounce
Bounce, come on, bounce
Bounce, come on, bounce

I slam the door, boom
When I come into the bedroom, wham bam
'Cause I'm the king of the castle, na na na
Turn me on, turn me loose, come on, come on

Try to hit it, it's a hassle, come get some of this
Don't forget the innuendo, play me like Nintendo
Never ever let go, screaming so loud you'll be hitting the crescendo
Doh ray me fa sol la te doh

Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Well, you gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some
You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some

Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Well, you gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some
You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some

Well I can hear the ring, ring, ring, the telephone goes ring, hello, hello
But we're still gettin' busy, pump, pump, pump huh
Now you're getting dizzy, I can slow it down
So you can pump it, pump it

Then I can move it fast, so you can pump it, pump it
Two balls and a bat, the pitcher wears a hat
Sliding into home base, tryin' to hit a home run
Swing batta, batta, batta, batta, batta swing

Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Well, you gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some
You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some

Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Well, you gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some
You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some

Come down, bring it up, bring it up
