Good-Fights:Lorde
There's no love
Tell your friends
You don't really love them

But you really love when
They braid your hair,
You give in

We can try to get in
To place where it ends
Where everything ends
It spins again

Ooh,
I didn't come all this way
Just for broken lives

Ooh,
You can feel down,
Like the people that are
In your mind

Ooh,
If it feels close
Even when you don't feel alright
It's alright
It's alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight
