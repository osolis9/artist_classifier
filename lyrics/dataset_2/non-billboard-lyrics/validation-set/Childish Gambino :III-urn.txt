III-urn:Childish Gambino 
I watch them all pass by
The moon & the stars
Let me hold you in my arms, forever more
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing, by the side
Let you go, oh to the sea, just for me

Don't ever let me, my love
Keep holding on
Let the modest go
As my mic goes to and fro
Waking up for one more show

We see him in the night
Tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of them
Cause I won't know
