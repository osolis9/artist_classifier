The-Veil:DECA
(There'll be food and drink and moonlight dancing)
(If you could see to it somehow)
(Could you lend your place or a Hotel room now?)
Now
Miss perfect was powderin' her nose
In a bathroom stall with a pile of chemicals
Gettin' suited
I was daydreaming about my music
Cleaning forbidden fruit out my teeth with a toothpick
The masqueraders are passing out party favors
And playing games that appeal to our darker nature
Like William Tell with a loaded glock
If you're not a short shot you'll decorate their flesh with red polka dots
Holly stepped out the restroom with toilet paper stuck to her stilettos, holdin' a golden glow
If all the king's men were riddled with bullet holes she'd be the bulimic bell of the ball that stole the show
But tragedy's a photo op, so strike a pose
With the seven headed beast
She's a sight to behold
My Babylonian beauty
Burgoeis(?)
Domineering
Designer wearing diamond earings
Find your bearings

(Just want to mention in passing)
I just wanna say
(There'll be food and drink and moonlight dancing)
It's gunna be great
(If you could see to it somehow)
If you could see to it
(Could you lend your place or a Hotel room now?)
Now
The sky Darkened
But no one seemed to notice
Fighter planes blocking out the sun like locusts
It's all showbiz
Glamour and glitz
Dafan play off of broadway and camera tricks
Little miss bites her lower lip
Wine trickles down her chin
I'm sittin' in a corner taking notes with a fountain pen
Inside looking out
Outside looking in
Sing her praise from a wrinkled page in a book of hymns
And when the moon turns blood red
And love is somethin' terrible and beautiful that's hangin' by a thread
You don't know if it's the end or a new beginnin'
But know for sure there's somethin' fundamentally flawed with the life that you've been livin'
I wasn't there for the crucifixion
We tightrope walk the thin line between truth and superstition
If you don't know you'll know real soon
The sacred and profane entombed in a hotel room now listen

(Just want to mention in passing)
I just wanna say
(There'll be food and drink and moonlight dancing)
It's gunna be great
(If you could see to it somehow)
If you could see to it
(Could you lend your place or a Hotel room now?)
Now
I've been so lost
Kicked while I was down
Barely had the strength to pull my sickly frame off the ground
I've been found out, a fraud a phony
Exposed
Felt the world breathe and taken beyond my threshold for pain
Maintain
Sang in the rain
I'm the only one to blame for not stakin' my claim
I have fallen so far from grace
Built, destroyed, and searched for new world's that would help me to fill the void
I am one zero
I killed the noise
I'm redrum
The rhythm section with no exception
The real McCoy
Searching for the source
The dream merchant in the sky
The most high
The pen allows the certain sin of pride
The serpent in the skies lurk around the city streets
I pulled the curtains back and saw Jehovah speakin' with the beast
Weigh my soul, Weigh my organic metronome
Place it on a scale
Help me see beyond the
Veil
