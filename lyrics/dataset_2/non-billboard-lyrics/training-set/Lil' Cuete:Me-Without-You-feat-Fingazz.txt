Me-Without-You-feat-Fingazz:Lil' Cuete
I don't want to see,
Me without you, you without me
I don't want to see,
Me without you, you without me

Ever since we hooked up, it's just been me and you,
Good and bad times, but we still made it through
And I don't want to see you with somebody new,
So I'll do whatever it takes for me to make it with you
I love the way it feels when I'm touching your body,
All alone, on our own, love when you're acting naughty
Light skin, nice shape, with the beautiful face,
I know that you're the type of girl that I couldn't replace
And I don't ever want to have to see you go,
Cause if you did, I wouldn't want no one, I'd rather be alone
I need you in my life, I'm not afraid to admit it,
So don't tell me that it's over, cause girl I know it isn't
I know I made you sad, and I'm sorry that I did it,
But please babygirl don't tell me that you're finished
I promise I can show you I'm the one that's for you,
And I don't care about who knows it mija, I love you

Me without you, I can't see it,
Girl I need you, please believe it
Give me one more try,
I'll make it worth your wild

Me without you, I can't do it,
Girl I know, I put you through it
They don't want to see,
You with me

And not a day goes by, without me thinking of you,
I couldn't picture me happy, without picturing you
You know we got many that don't want to see us together,
I know it's been a little rough, but me let you go, never
And it don't matter what they say or do,
Cause they're never gonna change the way I feel about you
I'm not impressed by other women, I won't waste my time,
I mean look at yourself baby, you're so dam fine
And I ain't lying when I say that you're one of a kind,
You're always on my mind, your beauty shine, I'm so glad you're mine
And I could look, but never find someone quite like you,
And I apologize for everything I put you through
I can't get enough of you, and you know it too,
I can see you on the ile, and you're walking through
And that's all I ever need in my life,
All my dreams will come true, when I make you my wife
That's right

Me without you, I can't see it,
Girl I need you, please believe it
Give me one more try,
I'll make it worth your wild

Me without you, I can't do it,
Girl I know, I put you through it
They don't want to see,
You with me

I know these girls think you're lucky, but I'm no fool,
I know it's me that's lucky, for being with you
I love your long hair and pretty eyes, and you're the perfect size,
The kind of girl that'd be wanted by other guys
You by my side, I'll never be lonely,
I'll always want you to be my one and only
Became addicted to the love you showed me,
I only want you to be the one to hold me
You're so sweet all I want is you,
Cause when I close my eyes, all I can picture is you
And that's how it will always be,
So come here and tell me you feel the same as me

Me without you, I can't see it,
Girl I need you, please believe it
Give me one more try,
I'll make it worth your wild

Me without you, I can't do it,
Girl I know, I put you through it
They don't want to see,
You with me

I don't want to see,
Me without you, you without me
I don't want to see,
Me without you, you without me

I don't want to see,
(Fi-fi-fingazz on the track)
I don't want to see,
Me without you, you without me
