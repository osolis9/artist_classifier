Runnin-feat-Notorious-B-I-G-:Configa
Check it, I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game,
got a ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into
the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make
But still I'm having memories of high speeds
When the cops crashed
As I laugh pushing the gas when my glocks blast
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and many wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies
now the whole world trying to screw me,
even the cops tried to sue me
So what can I do but stay true, sipping 22's a brewing
Now the medias trying to test me,
got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, thats my mind's state
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate
Ma main man had 2 strikes, slipped,
got arrested and flipped
He screamed 'Thug Life!' and emptied the clip
