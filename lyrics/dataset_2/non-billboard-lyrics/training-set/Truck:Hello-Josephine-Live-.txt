Hello-Josephine-Live-:Truck
Hello Josephine How do you do?
Do you remember me baby Like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me I was a fool, fool, fool
I used to walk you home I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella Every time it rained
You used to cry so much It was a cryin' shame
Hello Josephine How do you do?
Do you remember me baby
Like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me I was a fool, fool, fool
Solo
Hello Josephine How do you do?
Do you remember me baby
Like I remember you?
You used to laugh at meI was a fool, fool, fool
You used to live over yonder
By the railroad track
When it rained, you couldn't walk
I had to tote ya on my back Now you try to make me leave It was to be like that
Hello Josephine
