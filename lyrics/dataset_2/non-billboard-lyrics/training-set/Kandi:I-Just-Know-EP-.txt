I-Just-Know-EP-:Kandi
Yes you are, the man that I was born to love.
Yes you are, the one that I canâ€™t get enough of
You are, everything Iâ€™ve been missing
You are, so I wonâ€™t put up a resistance

People ask me how I know
Cuz I feel it in my heart
How I feel so strange inside, whenever weâ€™re apart
I just know, cuz I can feel it in my soul
I just know, cuz Iâ€™ve never felt this way before
I just know, because Iâ€™ve got this special feeling
I know I feel it with everything within me

Yes you are, everything that I need
Yes you are, I feel that youâ€™re the other half of me
Yes you are, the air that I breathe
You are, the man that makes me so complete

People ask me how I know
Cuz I feel it in my heart
How I feel so strange inside, whenever weâ€™re apart
I just know, cuz I can feel it in my soul
I just know, cuz Iâ€™ve never felt this way before
I just know, because Iâ€™ve got this special feeling
I know I feel it with everything within me


Donâ€™t ever question how I feel, because I know our love is real
People talk about how our love, began but itâ€™s not for them to understand
They ask me how I can I be sure, that youâ€™re the one but Iâ€™m secure
They ask me how I know its love, Iâ€™m so confident because

I just know, cuz I can feel it in my soul
I just know, cuz Iâ€™ve never felt this way before
I just know, because Iâ€™ve got this special feeling, deep inside
I know I feel it with everything within me
I know, I know, I know, I just know, I just know it. I feel it deep
Within, I just know it.
