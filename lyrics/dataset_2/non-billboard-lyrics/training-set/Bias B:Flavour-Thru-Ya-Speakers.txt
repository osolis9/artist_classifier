Flavour-Thru-Ya-Speakers:Bias B
(*Prod. by Jase)


[Bias B:]
My dad keeps on bugging me to save my cash*
You'll need a house and all that, I should be making stacks
But I'm waiting back, hanging out with mates who rap
Always late paying tax, don't save a cent, I always raid the stash
I like to splash it on some dinner and wine
Having the time of my life, late nights comfort me, I wind my mind
I find I spend too many hours on end
putting a bend in my brain with substance I shouldn't recommend
I settle in for a night on the couch
But this Hip Hop life has got me waking up, I should be passing out
Walking past my house, smell the passing about
A free paper, time for play, but let me spark it up now

Flavour thru the speakers, smelling lovely

Sometimes I wonder why I bother to rap
Travel interstate just to rock on a track
Wake up after the show and I'm coughing up black
I wish my wallet was fat, I've got to stop and look back
And all these kids want to chat, always the same old convo
Disable that shit and let me sit and sip my Cointreau
I've got no time for this idle conversation
Damn right it's wasting, trains the same in every state
and I'm hating the scene like Lyrical Commiss' at times like this
Wanna find a chick to kiss, but some kid's got some lyrics to spit
I've had enough of it, sometimes I can't be fucked with it
You roll that scoob yet D? Let's puff on it

Flavour thru the speakers, smelling lovely

My name is always on the door list so fuck the cost of it
Everything always free with a rhinoceros hanging off of it
On top of this I've got to write lyrics that Chopper ripped
I used to send out promos, now I'm shipping out a box of shit
Watch kids stop me on the street, they want their shit signed
Spit rhymes into my ear and let me know how much they dig mine
Gone are the days getting pissed, drinking to get blind
Instead go out for dinner with mates and slowly sip wine
See basically my shit shines on stage when I kick rhymes
Drinking Cointreau cranberry with a twist of lime
The radio cohost who occasionally smokes
Go crack a bottle of Moet with chick's breast cause I'm so stoked
