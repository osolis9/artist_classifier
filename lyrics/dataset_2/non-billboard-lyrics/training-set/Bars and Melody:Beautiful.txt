Beautiful:Bars and Melody
Be-a-utiful
Don't tell me girl 'cos I'm being truthful
When I tell you you're perfection
Take a minute look at you reflection, oh
Never put yourself down
‘Cos I'ma lift you up before you drown
When I see you in the crowd
The beat in my heart only gets louder
Your hair, your eyes, your style
The way that you stretch and the way that you smile
Girl I have been watching you for a while
You will be making me run for a mile

Your personality too much to handle
Ya light up the room like a candle
Can't you see girl?
I hope you believe in destiny

The day I met you, I became somebody
Now I'm standing next to you
You make me feel like somebody
Tell me what you wanna do
I just wanna be with you (with you)
Wanna be with you (with you)
Just wanna be with you (with you)
Tell me baby what you wanna do

Come over here, we don't need to think about it
Life's way too fast to overthink about it
It comes down to what I don't want to lose
Million girls in the world but I choose you
You got some in the vibe, the way you move
The way you talk, I want to prove to you
That I ain't fake, it's give or take
Wanna slow it down pull the emergency break
‘Cos you got something that I need
My heart's with you just listen, believe
Don't be shy when I hold you close
You're the only one I ever want the one I want the most (oh)

The day I met you, I became somebody
Now I'm standing next to you
You make me feel like somebody
Tell me what you wanna do
I just wanna be with you (with you)
Wanna be with you (with you)
Just wanna be with you (with you)
Tell me baby what you wanna do

Your eyes they shine to me
Your imperfections pass me
You are perfect the way that you are
I'll be the sky and you'll be a star
I could be a moon to your light
You add the goodness to my night
Now rest your head and go to sleep
I will be yours for you to keep

Baby girl don't be shy, come dance with me
Me and you on the dancefloor has to be
When I hold you close, baby, my boo
‘Cos you give me a sweet taboo
Your heart's locked up, give me the key
Forever my lady, you made me see
When I'm with you, girl they don't faze me
In my arms you're a charm, you should show it baby
We should slow down, if you're gonna be mine
Don't need to rush, let's take our time
(Skip a beat) Skip a beat, every time you're around
Baby you could be my brandy, I wanna be down

Your personality too much to handle
Ya light up the room like a candle
Can't you see girl?
I hope you believe in destiny

The day I met you, I became somebody
Now I'm standing next to you
You make me feel like somebody
Tell me what you wanna do
I just wanna be with you (with you)
Wanna be with you (with you)
Just wanna be with you (with you)
Tell me baby what you wanna do
