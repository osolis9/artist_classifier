Shaniqua
Hello?
Nah Nah she don't live here man
I thought I told you!
Yo, I think you need to step off aight?!

Moved into my apartment after U n Iversity
The only one who lives here is me! So why the phone ring along?
I got no friends except Mike and he's gone for the summer!
And I just want sum peace n quiet!
Come to my room and it's a telephone riot
Ring-a-ling-a-ling
Everytime I take a step can't sleep can't eat can't breathe can't bet
Can't even get my work done
Cuz ppl keep callin with the same damn question
Hello Is Shaniqua there?
Nah, she neva moved out last year, I think you have tha wrong numba, this is little T
U sure u ain't Shaniqua's brother?
MAN can't you just leave me alone? This ain't Shaniqua's house, this ain't her phone, and dont call back again, cuz if u do, u know the answer man
*Chorus*
Shaniqua dont live here no mo'
Shaniqua dont live here no mo'

HELL NO
Shaniqua dont live here no mo'
Shaniqua dont live here no mo'
Shaniqua dont live here no mo'
Is Shaniqua there?

Verse 2
I wonder who Shaniqua is
What she does and where she lives
Is she pothead with too many zits?
Or a movie star, with some big ass tits
Does she take the train, or drive in a car?
Work in the office? Or down at the bar?
How the hell should I know? She could be albino for all i care!
Hello, is Shaniqua there?
Yeah, she is, but she can't talk now, she's busy milkin on purple cow, and talkin to the easter bunny!
Man you think you're funny?
Shut up beavis i told you 6 times before

Chorus

Check my machine on friday, there was 22 messages
Man I can't win at this
One said
This is for the kid livin with Shaniqua, if you want that trick u can keep her!
Will this ever cease? So i can get some sleep?
Shaniqua moved out leave a message at the beep
*beep*
Yo...Shaniqua...I love you..... Call me...

Chorus
