1 Million Ways To Burn
I look upon you 
with eyes burnt from tears 
sear the meat of my heart with 
memories 

of your hot/cold words 
your dry ice words 

sticking 
stinging 
singing 

with vision blurred 
I watch 
our love go up in a frigid smoke 
guess I got to close 
I inhaled 
I choked 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

Etched you name on my walls 
with the fire in your touch 
Our ardor once warmed like summer 
soldered bodies 
we swam 
in simmering sweat 

I 
melting metal 
softening 
glowing fiery orange like the sun 
bending 

You 
blacksmith 
branding 

At strangest times 
I feel the heat of the iron 
still 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

Like smoldering coals now 
weaker 
but able to burn 
still 

3rd degree 
1st degree 

This hurt turns angry 
scalds 
like freshly boiled tea water 
spilled upon flesh 
making skin bubble 
then blister 
later to heal 
scarring 
still 

Etch my name on your wall with a caustic tongue 
hope at strangest times you feel the heat 
still 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

Shall we leave our love at the stake 
within a fence of flames 

sacrificed on an altar of discontent 
sacrificed for no greater purpose 
on an altar of self 
for the purpose of self 

Will the rains come 
to douse or drown 
Will we rebuild from the ember and ash 

Or will nothing ever grow here 
on this burnt earth 
that was 
us 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

slow burn, slow burn 
slow burn, slow burn 

Burn 
from passion 
or displeasure 
Burn 

slow burn
