Lord what have I become, what have I done, done, done (x8)

Im stuck in a maze, so close to my brain Krayzie loco insane, to the brain as I choke on this haze Dont know if Im going through a phase Or is it just part of the game I walk in the rain, its funny the pain keep on calling my name My mama keep sayin I need to change, pray to god and be saved But I just cant see me escaping my ways As Im cocking my guage, Im clocking my paper We already cought up, its too late to save us So tell the mayor dont be comming around here, cause we gon have to blaze em Struggle in the city life, hussle till we get it right Muscle when I hit the grind, troubles a good friend of mine I feel like Ill never get out of the ghetto, Im in this too deep Too much heat in the streets, they wont let go Im tired of being broke, living with the poor Sleeping on the floor, eatin' whatever I stole Dats me runnin up in that liquor store Willin to let this pistol smoke Oh you think its a joke, hurry up and get the doe!

Lord what have I become, what have I done, done, done (x4)

Determination is my motivation, patience aint a virtue Aint ate or baked in days, either I get paid or I murk you Its as simple as that, so empty it into the sack If you hear the clcik of the gat, that mean you walking too slow, You gotta move quicker than that, cash money On my mind while my nines on my victim If you waist any mo time, givin 6-5 time to get here I might get violent in here, my baby momma wantin child support This chick be tripping everytime in court Ah ah, dont you press that panic button Dont you make me hang you somthing Dont wanna be the one to take your life, not I Dear Father, my minds going insane Its getting harder, am I supposed to maintain Maybe I should just end it all myself But than, how would that help if Im doing this to gain wealth I aint trying to be a killer, Im playing a role In a movie of life, but its out of control!

Lord what have I become, what have I done, done , done (x4)
