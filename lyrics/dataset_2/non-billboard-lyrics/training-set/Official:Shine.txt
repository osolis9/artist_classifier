Shine:Official
High cut angel, what's been on your mind?
Is it the way I'm flying way too fast for my own kind?
You're brighter than the morning sun, the moon and all afar
So help me up to where you are, just like the star you are, are

Light me up with your shine
Fill me up from the inside
I won't fall down with you by my side
Light me up with your shine
Pave the way at midnight
I can't fall when you're so close by
When I think about you I succumb
To the best world I can dream, whatever I believe
I could feel you touching all along

I just needed to see what you are

High sweet starlight fall into my arms
And you and I can feel what it's like to share a beating heart
We can take the ocean, the land then the skies
Forever here with you I can see it in your eyes, eyes
Light me up with your shine
Fill me up from the inside
I won't fall down with you by my side
Light me up with your shine

Pave the way at midnight
I can't fall when you're so close by

When I think about you I succumb
To the best world I can dream, whatever I believe
I could feel you touching all along
I just needed to see what you are
Drown me in your eyes half open

And tell me how you are the one that speaks to me again
Fire in our eyes, lead us there
Fire in our eyes, lead us there

Light me up with your shine
Fill me up from the inside
I won't fall down with you by my side
Light me up with your shine
Pave the way at midnight
When I think about you I succumb
To the best world I can dream, whatever I believe
I could feel you touching all along
I just needed to see what you are
