Come on, show me what you're missing, tell me what's bothering you

Well I'm on my way, yeah I'm on my way, yeah yeah

Chorus:
Take me away - come and get your lovin' now
Take me away - come on, come on
Take me away -  come on into my life, 'cause I need you tonight

I'll listen to you darlin', tell me what you want to do
No he doesn't love you, doesn't love you like I want to
So I'm leaving tonight, I want to make it all right
'Cause it's late in the night, and I'm needing you, so

chorus

If you want me to love you, I'll show you what you gotta do, that's true
It's not enough just to know you, I need someone to hold on to, and it's you
So baby come on, baby come on, baby come on

Yeah I'm on my way, yeah I'm leaving today, yeah yeah
Yeah I'm on my way, maybe tonight

Take me away - come and get your lovin' now
Take me away - come on, come on
Take me away - somewhere I've never been before

Take me away...  (repeats out)
