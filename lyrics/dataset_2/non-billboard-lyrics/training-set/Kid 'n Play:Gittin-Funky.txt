Come on, come on baby
Come on baby

The ingredients for comin' correct we select
On the set beats and rhymes that are both in check
Herby's behind the board cold gettin' respect
We are Kid 'n Play in total effect

We're gettin' funky, up to par
And that's with a hyped up beat just playin' on the guitar
You'll feel the bass, it's soft and wet, yes, honey
You'll get a taste, but not just yet, right, money?

The beat is live, troop, so don't front on it
Get it while the getting's good and just jump on it
Minute by minute, yo, hour by hour
Kid 'N Play got soul power, we're gittin' funky

We're not profilin', we're freestylin'
Got you dancin' in the aisle and, you be smilin'
From ear to ear, let's make this clear, dear
Ridin' the range on the rap frontier

Here, is where we stand by popular demand
Let's have a hand for the 4 man band
Other MC's in the dust trailin'
We got quick on the horns just wailin' around

So if you're feelin' down we're gonna cure that
Or with the hyped up sound makin' sure that
A troopers gonna say at the end of the night
That the boys were right and they rocked the mic, gittin' funky

Come on, come on baby
Come on baby
Come on, come on baby
Come on, come on baby

Yeah
Come on, come on baby
Yeah
Come on, come on baby
Yeah
Come on baby
Yeah
Come on, come on baby

Just call me Play I say, you gotta listen close
If you don't dance to this, then you're comatose
'Cause I'm fierce, I'll pierce your soul
Step back, relax, Jack, watch the heads roll

A rhymin' editor, competitor competitive
So hyper you're gonna need a sedative
Just take a hike on a bike when I'm on the mic
Told you I'm a cobra, I'm ready to strike

Administer, sinister, right, so savage
Axe to the wax, I'm gonna do damage
Like a volcano about to erupt
Get set, I'm gonna wind it up, I'm gittin' funky

I see you standin' with the dumb look on your face
Hey, if you came here to stand, you're in the wrong place
You got to move your feet so there's no doubt
'Cause when I drop the beat it's time to work out

Onto the floor, let's start to go off
This ain't hardcore but yo, it ain't soft
You been throwin' wack rhymes at me
Right 'n exact, I'm doin' exactly

What I wanna do, and what you gonna do
Is clap your hands when I get in front of you
Hype beats and rhymes are the recipe
Yo man don't even mess with me, we're gittin' funky

A style that's bold, so cold that it'll freeze ya
Numb your mind, give ya amnesia
You'll forget why you ever stepped up to bat
You try to dis, hah, we'll have none of that

Listen to me, I'm known to please, gonna
Lift up the crowd like Hercules when I
I step to the stage the microphone I seize
And defy you to try and take it from me

Your brain must be numb if you think you got my number
Boy, you're just dumb and I think you're gettin' dumber
To think that you could handle the Kid, ha-ha, just to dis
Yo, I'm the best at this, I'm gittin' funky
