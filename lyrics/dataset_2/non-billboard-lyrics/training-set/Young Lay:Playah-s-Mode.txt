Playah-s-Mode:Young Lay
[Ebony]
Sup ya'll this is Ebony I'm from a playah'z hole with young lay
I can't let you down til you take it off

[Young Lay]
Now there's a dope rhyme sale up in this town
Listen to the sounds I bring
I be dropping hoes be jocking like feens
I comes so clean when I spit in his mouth piece
Coming with that young playa shit fools get with or without me
Living life dangerously but hoes be in the nickel mix
When I think I hind of this but silly rabbits full of tricks
But I don't trip let her be a mac though she ain't
Baby bought the rules in the fucking dank
Tip toed out the door right after I g'd her
I wanted to do the crew so how the fuck am I going to sleep with her
I liggity loc the side digged her down like I'm straight
I bet that trickity tramp bitch keep me down now I'm back on the set
Kicking up some more though yea hoe that's how it works
I told her I'am getting paid cuz the game is like some minute maid
I still got hoes to faint
LAY DAMMIT my nigga played the dozen running through her crew
Her sister partner and her cousin
School I though you know in 92 but it's only buzzing
Then up in 93 in the vidy there always up to something
The po or not got you running way past 94 cuz they couldn't find me though
Chillin up in my playah'z home

[Chorus x2]
Make ma ma ney ma ney
Make ma ma ney ma ney
That the way we do it
Off in my playaz home

[Young Lay]
I spit some game at these hoes they can't get a hold of
I said to be with me I going to need somebody I can fold love
Steady cashflow where a nigga should be getting strady paid
On breaking a bitch and leaving a hoe with some juice and change
You got a job hoe and you know u need to get one
To get with me cuz see I need to get some income
Straight pimp the p, i, m, p, the bitch that be steady pleasing me
Cuz now I'm a mc
I can't wait got a date in jamaca
Me and the chocolate trip on a trick with some dank huh
I threw my loccest side gruve in and put my dick smooth in
And now she want to plan to move in
I told the young baby like this
I hear that shit she dropping put some heam in the spliff
And quit the panties dropping what do I mean naw
I gots to go back to velliho hit the L's in my playah'z home

[Chorus x2]

[Young Lay]
Back in the day I used to be tripping off the messy hoes
Young life been a trip peeped the pimp game
Ever saw the straight up used to check a hoe
Getting it for the means though
Fast talking comment brains full of bomb in
See pencils never come in
Always with that to the gangsters that used to spit rap
And still took heat and ol shcool kick back
But now they living phat growing up off of my shit
Why you g'd l y be you little ol suckas
They can never get enough of this loccest shit
Running up in your bitch niggas scared to get a dose of this the game
The shit you was on up on but let you tell it
They never knew about my crew and hoe we in the valley
Late night creeping out the back door
Dank box in my demo tape they wouldn't play me though
I gained publicity now they like to listen see
I turn nuts when I hits the set nigga what
But now I got to find me a bigger cut niggas hate
To see me in triggers got the biggest gut
I pulled the shit now I'm stuck
Yo young lay where you stuck
Off in my playah'z home

[Chorus]
