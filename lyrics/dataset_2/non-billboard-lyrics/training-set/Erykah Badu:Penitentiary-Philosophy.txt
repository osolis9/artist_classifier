Penitentiary-Philosophy:Erykah Badu
Here's my philosophy, livin' in a penitentiary
Brothers all on the corner
Tryin' to make believe
Turn around, ain't got no pot to pee

Make me mad when I see ya sad
Can't stand to see ya hussle doin' bad
But you can't win when your will is weak
When you're knocked on the ground

Evil
Don't you test me
Evil
You won't win

Oh why
  (World)
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad? Yeah
So mad, yeah

Oh why
  (World)
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad? Yeah
So mad, yeah

I'm tellin' you the truth
I hope I'm not being too cruel
Since you ain't playing by the rules
I'm 'bout to kick you off your stool

Evil
Don't you test me
Evil
You won't win

Oh why, why
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad? Yeah
So mad, yeah

Why in the world
  (World)
Why world
Do you want me to be so mad? Yeah
Say why

I am a warrior princess
I have come from the other sun
Gather all of your members
Unite them as one

Move together in harmony
Build a bridge, now destroy a bridge
Eliminate your weakness
Conquer evil, the demon and live forever together

Why can't we get along
And take all the funky tones
And make up a funky song
That be bangin' on and on

Make me mad when I see ya sad
With the same look ya momma had
But ya can't win when your will is weak
But ya get out ya seat

Oh why, why
Why world do you want me to be so mad?
So mad, yeah

Why in the world
  (World)
Why world do you want me to be so mad? Yeah
So mad, yeah

Why in the world
  (World)
Why world do you want me to be so mad? Yeah
So mad, yeah

Why in the world
  (World)
Why world do you want me to be so mad? Yeah
So mad, yeah

Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Oh, why, why in the world? Yeah
World yeah, world yeah, world yeah

Bring it all back
Bring it all back
Bring it all back
