F-My-Ex:Lady Leshurr
Man F my ex man
He was just a joker man (trust me, seriously)
I don't even know why I'm talking about him
He was a wasteman anyway

I tell my friends F my ex
Couldn't care less if they F'ed my ex
Crossed him out yeah I x'd my ex
Things weren't right so I left my ex
Little man ting he was childish
He had a little man's ting, he was childish
Small like a child's dish
Bank account was on minus
Look them ones when he tries moving to your friends
Them ones when he's always chilling on the ends
Them one's when he's in the passengers seat
Hollerin' at girls in his best friend's Benz
Step your money up, have a motive
You're thirsty, here's Volvic
And I don't need any man paying for my hair closures

Why did you bring him?
Why did you bring him to me?

My ex was stressed
Stressed for my breasts
So I told him it's over
Via text
Moved house moved on to the next
I'm way up, blessed
Did he think I was impressed
When he showed up at my address
I was like hold on a minute, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
I was like don't even finish, stop what you're doing
Look stop what you're doing
Cos I don't even want you no more
I don't even want to know more
Delete my number don't call
Why did you bring him oh lord
I'm like oh lord

(Sure you do)

(I'm not coming back)

(Nah man, you're a joke ting)
