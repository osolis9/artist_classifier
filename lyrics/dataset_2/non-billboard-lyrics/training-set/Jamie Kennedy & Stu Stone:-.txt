This is the part where you dance
This is the part where you boogey (ooh ooh ooh)
This is the part where you dance
Ladies shake your booty
Shake your pants like this
Shake your pants (shake it, shake it, shake it)
Shake your pants like this
Shake your pants
(Uh Uh Uh Uh...)
Ladies let me hear you

You're just too good to be true
Yeah good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
I love ya baby
You'd be like heaven to touch (mmhmm)
I wanna hold you so much (yeah-yeah)
At long last love has arrived
I thank God I'm alive
You're too good to be true
Can't take my eyes
Can't take my eyes off you... YO!

Neil Diamond/Disco Mode
Pardon the way that I stare
No one else you can compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Country Mode
I love you baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you baby
To warm those lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I found you, stay
And let me love you baby
Let me love you...

Heavy Metal Mode
You're good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much

Back to Rap Mode
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At last long love has arrived
I thank Lord I'm alive
You're too good to be true
I can't stop watching you
Can't take my eyes off you
Too-good-to-be-true

Ending -Musical Mode-
I love you baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you baby
To warm those lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say (shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I found you, stay
And let me love you baby
Let me love you

This is the part where you boogey
This is the part where you dance!
