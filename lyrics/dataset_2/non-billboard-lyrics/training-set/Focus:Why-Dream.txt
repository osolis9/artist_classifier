Why-Dream:Focus
Why dream about the future?
Now is the present as bad as the present can be

Why dream about the future?
The light is dark and darkness is all you can see

Planes go flight by flight
(Planes go flight by flight)
Ready for a fight
(Ready for a fight)
Ships pass in the night
(Ships pass)
Through the Bosporus
Marching columns sound
(Marching columns)
Reasons yet unfound
For me for you
For all of us

Why dream about the future?
The sun is shining upon a world full of fear

Why dream about the future?
When the clash and the bang of that future is coming to near

This is our time
(This is our time)
We will drink this wine
(We will drink this wine)
Reaches our cup
(Reaches)
And we like it fine
Please don't hesitate
Before it is too late
You had your chance and lift your fate

We dream about the future!
Where we can change things as they ought to be

We dream about the future!
Where we will be moving and choosing our own destiny
