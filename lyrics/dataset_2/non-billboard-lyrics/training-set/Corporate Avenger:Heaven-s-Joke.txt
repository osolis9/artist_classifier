Heaven-s-Joke:Corporate Avenger
Crazy I 
Talk to the sky
For this is heaven's joke
Water flows
The mountain knows
For she is old and wise
Crazy me 
Talks to the trees
This hole it is my home
Circles end 
Where I begin
For everything is whole
It's easy to kill me
Cuz I'm like the water
Sunshine
Is mine
And your time
Is over
Silent I
Lie in her side
Her beauty makes me choke
And down below the fire grows
And so we are alive
She die in me
So I can see
A world I've never known
Then again so far within
I'd rather be alone.

It's easy to kill me
Cuz I'm like the water
Sunshine
Is mine
And your time
Is over
Arrows fly through frozen sky
Their fire leads me home
Vessel shines for life is light
This universe was mine
Now begins where before ends 
So this robe has it's time
Circles end where I begin
For everything is whole
It's easy to kill me
Cuz I'm like the water
Sunshine
Is mine
And your time
Is over
