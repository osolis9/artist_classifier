S-A-N-T-A-N-A-:The Diplomats
I'm back, Juelz Santana, I'm back, Juelz Santana
Y'all got a problem, his name is Santana
I'm Back, uh oh
No one to play around, we'll squeeze them hammas
Santana, Santana, Santana

Okay, I'm reloaded, okay, the heat's loaded
Okay, now we rollin', okay
My fo'-fo' piece talkin', sound, oh, so sweet talkin'
The Momo street talkin' is Stone Cold Steve Austin

An' I bang it well, slang it well, shave it well
Hell, you lookin' at a preview of the Matrix 12
L, rock dem, I'm here to shake the bells
Shake the bells, what's my name?

You got that gear right, I'm not that queer type
Nasty behind the wheel, but my mind ain't steered right
Fuck drivin' reckless, my mind is reckless
Plus, I stay with two time crime offenders

I can't give it up like an old man, who can't get it up
I'm not a man 'til it's up
So now I'm rappin' bad, I'm back, I'm badder
Shit, y'all probably think I'm takin' 'Rap Viagra '

Got as many songs as Pac had on 'Locked Stash'
I can pop songs just like I pop tags
I do not brag, just watch, fag
I'm here to get the keys to the lock back

Open the door, close it an' re-lock that
Don't touch, stop that, it's locked black
An' guess what? I'm back, I'm back

Y'all got a problem, his name is Santana
I'm back, uh oh
No one to play around, we'll squeeze them hammas
I'm back, uh oh

Say hello to my little friend, hello, before I pull again
An' show you my bullets, friend, hello, my name please
Straight, blahm, the Lima, for cake stand behind ya
Make plans to drop ya I ain't Aunt Jemima

Bitch, I ain't here to wind ya, I ain't here to dine ya
I came here to pop ya
Shit an' I came here for lobster, the whole damn shabang
An' they ain't bring the pasta

Now I got to be rude, they ain't got me my food
I'm not goin' be used, shots goin' eat through
This kid's small body an' this big long shotty
That'd just make shit here all sloppy

Straight out the pot, I'm ready, straight out like rock, I'm ready
Or more proper, I'm straight out like hot spaghetti
It's rock an' roll time, it's lock an' load time
Show time, adios amigo, gotta go time

Yeh, but I'll be right back atcha
Twice back atcha like Christ, back atcha
You'll be like "damn, that's one nice ass rappa
I kinda like that rappa, I wanna be like that rappa"

No, but if you bite that rappa, I might bite back atcha
With that rifle atcha
Yeh, I know that might sound bad
But it's, I'm back

Y'all got a problem, his name is Santana
I'm back, uh oh
No one to play around, we'll squeeze them hammas
I'm back, uh oh

Juelz Santana, Juelz Santana
