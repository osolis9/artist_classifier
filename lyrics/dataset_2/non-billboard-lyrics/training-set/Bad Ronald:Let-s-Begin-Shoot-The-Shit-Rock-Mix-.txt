Let-s-Begin-Shoot-The-Shit-Rock-Mix-:Bad Ronald
I can't believe that shit
I can't believe that's all, I can't

We gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

I'm holdin' but I'm 'bout to cop some more
I'm real high 'cause I smoke a lot before
So what you stoppin' for, keep passin' by
Smoke good weed, get a long lasting high

And I know it might be right, I know it might be wrong
But if I'm gonna have a drink it might as well be strong
It's not the beginning and it's not the end
We gonna pass the shit around, you can hit it again

Let me be young live life while I can
Get the wrong idea of what I actually am
Like a flash in the pan so hold on tight
Catch a little buzz and everything gone be alright

We gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

We gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

Once the beer starts flowin', everything gone be fine
I'll be stuck up in the party, tryin' to get mine
Left paw on the wine, right margarita shakin'
Tryin' to concentrate but I'm straight space cakin'

Life is Erie like the lake and I be forgettin' what I know
My girl told me to wait but I had to come and go
You steady with the flow, palpitation precision
Glue my feet to the track to properly ride the rhythm

I ain't given a flying fuck what you didn't care to say
'Cause karma gonna get you in the long run anyway
And in the short for the sport I was straight Charles Bronson
In Houston with Allen, you were lickin' Larry's Johnson

We gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

We gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

Everybody raise your drinks to the sky
Mr. DJ, make ya sound amplify
Lovely ladies get up, don't be shy
And listen up as I clarify

My mission to why I'm spittin 'cause y'all be whinin' and bitchin'
Moanin', groanin' and dissin'
There ain't no hate in my crew, we just do what we do
We ain't stoppin' we got plenty trees and enough brew, so

Everybody raise your drinks to the sky
Mr. DJ, make ya sound amplify
Lovely ladies get up, don't be shy
Go for yours, don't be standin' by

We gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

Gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

Gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

Gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound

We gonna light the weed, tap the keg
Shoot the shit, now let's begin
We're gonna kick right back, we're gonna sit right down
Enjoy it girl, you gonna love the sound
