Espionage:Mareko
Yeah, last year we were swingin' blades
On these corny MCs
This year were dropping 'em
Guillotine style

Yeah, yo 2003 year of the robot
My mouth will stimulate your head like a blowjob
Once my pages absorb the ink from my Bic pen
My thoughts'll peak and I develop a sixth sense

That shelter the weak and manage the mislead
So character attacks are nowhere near possible
My effortless attempts to clear obstacles
Has to get under your skin like ingrown hair follicles

Ya think? A Samoan misfit of science
My brainwaves'll leave you stranded on Gilligan's island
I'm sick of the rhyming, sick of the liars
I'd rather listen to sixty minutes of silence

I'm nice yo Auckland cities conosuier
I take longer to toast than sesame seed molenberg
Shredding more documents than a crooked cops office clerk
So dwell on that before you drop a verse

Y'all want it then bring it I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here all day, all month, all year
It's me Mareko, when my records hit stores
It'll have the impact of a global war

Y'all want it then bring it, I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here all day, all month, all year
It's me Mareko when my records hit stores
Ain't nobody really gonna pay no attention to yours

The acranomical alchemist
Watching the world pass like a herman on house arrest
Plus the dickless told me to devour the counterfeit
Harder than Deff leopards drummer
Using his hands to count to ten
Straight up, I get dissed by these corny MCs

That rhyme Mareko With teko
But that juvenile shit doesn't faze me
'Cause you suckaz don't really want it like a deformed baby
I'm known for letting horses out their stables

With intentions to drop then top to bottom
On mountain faces
Rearranging your fan bases
Making the backpackers hand back their fat laces
I'm serious yo, obviously evident

I don't fuck with fags when I play then percentages
Oops, I mean takin' my percentages
When I proof read these biters plagiaristic sentences

Y'all want it then bring it I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here all day, all month, all year
It's me Mareko, when my records hit stores
It'll have the impact of a global war

Y'all want it then bring it, I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here all day, all month, all year
It's me Mareko when my records hit stores
Ain't nobody really gonna pay no attention to yours

I'm like straight up
(Straight up)
I can't be touched
(Touched)
I can't be seen
(Seen)

I can't be snuffed
(Snuffed)
My story unfolds if you ask too much
(Too much)
Reverse your blood flow make your heart go bust
I'm like straight up
(Straight up)

I can't be touched
(Touched)
I can't be seen
(Seen)
I can't be snuffed
(Snuffed)
My story unfolds if you ask too much
(Too much)

Reverse your blood flow make your heart go bust
I'm the conspiracy theory that travels without secrecy
A radio pirate hijacking your frequency
Fortified, these MCs are falling like Alicia Keys

Flat in chronological sequence
I'm equally gifted with all numbers
A habit of stepping on your lies like long jumpers
Some chap from my past life

Ouija board Internet access to the dark side
You don't wanna drop rhymes
You wanna keep them hidden
Like the porno archives on your hard drive

Fuck a sharp knife
My blunter side is never getting taken out
Like the fat girls in high school
My raps burn in side you with a towering inferno

That's only rivaled by my ego
So kiss my ragga dopest freeflow
For one amigo till that big head fit my sombrero

Y'all want it then bring it I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here all day, all month, all year
It's me Mareko, when my records hit stores
It'll have the impact of a global war

Y'all want it then bring it, I ain't going nowhere
I'll be here all day, all month, all year
It's me Mareko when my records hit stores
Ain't nobody really gonna pay no attention to yours
