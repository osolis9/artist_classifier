Star-and-the-Sky-feat-Skyzoo-:Dynasty
I've got stories to tell that are filling my spirit
Super star so bright I can't even get near it
But still some of the things I be hearing taking my feeling
That a whole generation is crying out for the healing
Listen, when I spit it you don't get it 
Rather listen to these phony MC's who swear they playing the billionaire
You won't believe that they chilling, making a killing 
When you ready for the real then I'm ready, able, and willing
I'm hype, that what they call it, them black boys with rhythm
They know when I'm 'bout to spit it, they toss and turn to wiggle
And know I'm from credential, know that I'm â€˜bout to win it
Yeah, I'm doing it for myself, I'm eliminating the middle man
Please, try and stop me, the female version of Rocky 
Embodying all my contingencies, legitimately been cocky
Broads are so sloppy, anything for a record 
I'm working for what I'm getting, legitimately I'm meant to break

I HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING 
I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
YEAH, I HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING 

The flow is like jumping over J sincerely on purpose
And answering the recorders like yeah, money deserved it
Handling my supporters so yeah, the money is perfect
Winners from the beginning, but shit, the running was worth it
Me? Shit, I'm working, my bitch passing for Birkin
They bash them and then they use the in the booth
Stuffing the burger in a booth, the truth is I'm in the booth for a coupe
Loving alone is the truth, it's all that I'm giving to you
So how do you stunting?
I was me from the day you opened the CD tray and the clovers of Cloud 9
And you loaded your CD J 
And now that I'm top 5 and I'm only a beat away
And my hands are full of music and broads, I'm Stevie J
Too fly to be a backpacker, Frisbee to stone is too high to be a trap rapper
And no one can rap after, heck, same story they told Sean
Fat for a 600 mil', the barrel's on

I HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING 
I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
YEAH, I HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING 

I'm way too dope to be classified 
Shine too bright for you to pass it by
Truth I would fold to be pacified
I'm the truth but some of you would rather pass a lie
One to the next one epitome of perfection
Most of y'all won't make it, it's the natural selection
Said you do it for the love but y'all showing no affection
But me, when I spit it, you know that I really mean it
Make the hair stand up on your chest 'cause you believe it
I'm bigger than what you seeing, greater than my appearance
My spirit is up ahead and me running the interference
While my speakers all blast, pump it so you can hear it and fear it
Set the bar too high for you to clear it, that's why they can't touch her
That's why they love her, I'm the star, up here with the Sky
We both hover so even if you learning to fly you can't cover
'Cause we up too high for your position down under

I HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING 
I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
YEAH, I HEAR YOU TALKING BUT YOU AIN'T SAYING NOTHING
