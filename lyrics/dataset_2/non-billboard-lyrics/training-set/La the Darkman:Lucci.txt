Lucci:La the Darkman
I came from a wealthy family
I joined the clan because I wanted to learn a special Kung Fu
To be a real expert and an actual fact
I've just become a killer, killing, that's all I know
Death, every day another

Gun rule
We gon' make this spicy
It's La Trapacanty right here
You know? And we gon' do it like this
Yeah, Darkman

Yo, yo, watch the Corleone give neck ties and puff bones
Stick Arabs for the crystals like Indiana Jones
Witness, La, hands of stone on this action packed odessey
Majesty livin' out the golden book prophecy
Unstoppable, Iron Shiek of rap speaks
Blaze a tree in the street, blue and gray Benz jeep
Tasmanian, rebel, new Wu tycoon
Two thousand-five lyrics, you'll catch on soon
New entrepreneur, no match to go to war
On tour, blowin' smoke out the four by four

Enjoyin' life, I don't know a man who live twice
Cee-Lo, king, rollin' dice, holdin' Glaciers of Ice
Playin' ninety-seven matten at the loft of Manhattan
While I get blitzed and rich, watch him run short flicks
With a bad chick, La been raw since eighty-six
On the block, new kicks with chalk and skunk mitts
Son, I'm fortunate to still be here, shells is close
City Lights, La The Dark, stay conceilin' the toast
'Cuz thieves who deceive get loot the most
But thieves that see me are left Holy as the Ghost

For that lucci, it's all about that lucci
Lucci, it's all about that
Gettin' money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays

Hey, lucci, it's all about that lucci
Lucci, it's all about that
Gettin' money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays

I'd rather die if I'm not livin' fly, now Y
Can't get a job with a corporate, fuck it, I'm gettin' high
Suicide committed in cells, dwellers square as hell
Children can't have a chance with impairable bells
Sufferin' in a jail, I don't recognize a soul
Reach one with a cold force, gon' be the one that have to be told
Behold the son of God with a scroll
Flame throwin' lyrics, niggaz better stop, drop and roll
Lyrics is gold, Darkman pushin' up in the land
Hit a spot fot a Rolex watch, two thousand grams

Now dip, 'cuz loose lip shorts ain't shit
But in this drug rap, I bang like the Bloods and the Crips
Guns and clips seen to make my state rotate
Stayin' close to a hornet, drinkin', bustin' that jake
Holdin' my weight, now a purchase 'bout to case
When I coke 'em and drop 'em it equal Cali earthquakes
I escape, baggin' worth, pawn porcelain plates
Get ill like Al Capone after sniffin' that ape
And my state from the halls of Hell
Sing-sing stick a spear through your chest like an ear and an earring

For that lucci, it's all about that lucci
Lucci, it's all about that
Gettin' money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays

Hey, lucci, it's all about that lucci
Lucci, it's all about that
Gettin' money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays

Niggaz and sneakers and over-night night crawler creapers
Cake junkies on the Jones plannin' a heist to get ya speakers
In that Acura, same soldiers attackin' ya
Desert camellion, no civilian, better know as Dracula
Seven, I'm 'bout to see about a half a mil'
With twenty niggaz perfectin' in Kung Fu skills

And fuck bitches, they only want they name on my will
And all you half-ass rappers, kid, you'll need to be killed
My shit is ill, the eels gave birth to my friend
I represent on all tracks like the number four train
Maintain, it's all about the cheese you gain
I get the studies, then the money and the bitches, fuck the fame

Hey, lucci, it's all about that lucci
Lucci, it's all about that
Gettin' money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays

Hey, lucci, it's all about that lucci
Lucci, it's all about that
Gettin' money in many ways in these last days
With Venom written wisdom, I have to say crime pays
Hey lucci, lucci
