I-ll-do-Anything:Damizza
You say you'll do anything, well sell a car, pawn your wedding ring
And off with them worldly goods, I need 'em, come tribute 'em to the king
Girl, the way I'm doing the thing, I may go topple damn game
Doing a damn thing, busting to move ya up out of the damn frame (N.U.N.E. Dawg)
You say do anything, I need you to be doing it all
Doing it ya'll while I'm doing it for all us
Keep doing the most from coast to coast - you know me
And not to be loving hoes and bitches ain't good for me
The only nigga that has fucked his whole block
And bitches keep coming back because they love it a lot
No need to ask questions, the word for why I stand
I do what the fuck I want, I'm a grown-ass man, bitch

I'll do anything that I wanna do
I'll do anything that I wanna do

You might spit a good game, but not quite like Dame
I fucked ya'll up with a simple name change
I hit it quick like weed on the bricks
Bread to these chips, beats flowing through the click
C'mon, don't stop Flows for dumbshits, tracks for assholes
You seen my hassle, it's a sick life (sick life)
No denying, when I'm like, fifty I'll have a fifty year run on you bums
