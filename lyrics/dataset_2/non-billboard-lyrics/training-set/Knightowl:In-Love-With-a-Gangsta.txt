In-Love-With-a-Gangsta:Knightowl
Baby, i know that right about know
you think we aint gonna make it.
But dont worry, believe in me
And call my name whenever you need me
I'll always be there for you
no matter what my daddy says

Daddy i'm in love with a thug
daddy i'm in love with a gangsta.
daddy i'm in love with a thug,
dont be mad cause i'm in love with a gangsta

(knightowl)
i never thought that i would meet the girl
that would stick around even though
you told me that your parents used to say I TOLD YOU SO!
he's a bald headed gangsta,
and through his eyes I see insanity
but girl that never stopped you,
and till this day i rock you
your my girl, and your the one
thats always been around
when i needed love, you held me tight,
you kissed me through the night.
people told you that i was violent,
people told you that i was crazy,
but still we both remained as one
when you feel pain, i feel the pain.
you never left my side,
when you was mad,
you kept it all inside
you never told me,
matter of fact you used to hold me
and that is just like loving
Like the world was made for me and you
Your so damn strong, I dedicate to you this song.
Cause your the woman, thats seen
the way i've now became a man.
I now make money off my raps,
don't need to take fools off the map.
But i will if i have to.
Don't think that I went soft.
All things be the same.
I'll put a hole inside your brain.

imma thank you for them times
you put a smile upon my face
you've always been able to make me see
that life be rough but i be tough
i gotta keep on fighting
all them trials and tribulations
life aint never been fair
but i gotta stay on top to make it through.
i gotta make it
cant let no motherfucker take it.
i always keep it real
with the shit that i reveal.
i cant let go, them evil thoughts
that creep all up inside me.
i gotta maintain composure
cause the devil walks beside me.
got good and bad upon my shoulders
but i feel them heavy
im so deranged
my minds insane
i'm cursed, I'm dead already
but what am i to do
when death keeps calling out my name
i feel the pain
but i wont complain
i'll sit and watch the rain
start thinkin and reminscing
bout them times we used to have
all them times we still be having
cause its you that gots the man in me
thoughts that make me see
how much i love you
i put no one above you
and i'm always thinking of you

i wanted to sweat you
since the very first day that i met you
but girl you made me wait
do you remember our first date?
i tried to grab your hand
you pushed me back and told me to stop
when all that i wanted to do
was hold that hand try to make you mine.
whoever thought that you and me
would get to be what we now be.

and without you I wont make it.
