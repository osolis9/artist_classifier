Dream-:Rhythmicru
{*Spooky computerized voice*}
I command you
To go, to sleep, and dream {*echoes*}

[Verse:]
Oh dreammmmmms! Oh!*
What am I gon' dream about?
I done dreamt all I can dream in life
I'm tryin to wake up and live
And make some money off of dreams that
That people been makin off MY dreams y'know
People think that everything in the world...
... last thing I dreamt about, electricity, no good!
You know I ain't gonna go for nothin like that
I pulled the plug, you may as well know what's gon' be happenin
Ain't nuttin gonna be...
... We are the ones that been wakin up the world
You don't want me to go to sleep
Pull the plug out on you and you'll be dead
I got a computer at home that's mean
That was invented back in 1930-somethin
You know the piano roll? You scared of that...
I went by, I went by somebody's house
A woman was makin love to her computer
She didn't have no, you know, pull the plug...
