The-Road:Seven
I can see the road
In the fading light
cross the old sky-moat
To set it all just right

So in the setting sun
In the rising moon
The story has begun
Road-god's granted boon

[Ref.:]
There's time enough to take it
Gonna take the miles, gotta go
To walk the way that is waiting
I'm never sad from roads that I know

In the setting sun
In the rising moon
The story has begun
Road-god's granted boon
