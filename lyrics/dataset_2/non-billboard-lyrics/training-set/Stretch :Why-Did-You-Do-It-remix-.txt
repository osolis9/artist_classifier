I've been thinking 'bout what you have done to me
The damage is much deeper then you'll ever see
Hit me like a hammer to my head
I wonder, were you pushed or were you led

Why did you do it?
Why did you do that thing to me
Why did you do it?
Why did you do that thing to me
The only one who knows the truth
man, thats him and me and you

My friends they listen to the things I say
They listen and they here more every day
But I know they never understand it
Because it was no accident you planded [hey, thats what he sings!?]

Why did you do it?
Why did you do that thing to me
Why did you do it?
Why did you do that thing to me
The only one who knows the truth
man, thats him and me and you

I've been thinking 'bout what you have done to me

Why did you do it?

Why did you do it?
Why did you do that thing to me
