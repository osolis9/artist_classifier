We-Funk-The-G-Funk-:Dove Shack
We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
  (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)
We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
 (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)

C Knight, well, can I expand my mind
Like a rubber band, its me niggy Knight man
Niggy Knight man, with the mic in hand
Just come to G Funk your mind
The Dove Shack is one of a kind

So stay tuned to the platoon
The bombs I drop to clear the room of wack MCs
Because G Funk is just a substance
Of music that you need

So proceed to pop it in yo tape deck
And I guarantee, when you listen to the fool named C
I'll make you say Woo! like Warren to the G

We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
  (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)
We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
 (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)

Now can I get an amen, like the corner street preacher
Seat yourself down and peep the main feature
The B O R O C is ocean
Out of control when I'm flowin', 'cuz I'm mind blowin'

The D O V E is so flossy so toss me
The herbal on sweet so I can rip verbal skills like Jah
Why would I walk away, walk away, when I can stay

In the G Funk
(Where rhythm is life)
Where we funk
(And life is rhythm)
Musical melodies laid with no discrepancy
My card is spreadin' like leprecy

We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
  (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)
We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
 (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)

Take a snip of the funk created for the G's
Strictly hip-hop, no wannabes
In front of me, we leave fools deliveries
Sloppily, nuthin' stoppin' me from playin' scores like Monopoly

So can we blaze G, it never seems to amaze me
All y'all fools, crazy
If you think that you can hide from the aroma of the G Funk
Funk for the G's, please

These, that you couldn't touch us with a twenty foot pole
Platinum is our goal, let Eastside roll
G is like Adam, Funk is like Eve
The G comes first but funk is what you need

We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
  (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)
We funk, 'cuz G-Funk blows my mind
 (G Funk, we funk, G Funk, we funk)

We come to funk the globe
Close your eyes and open your nose
G Funk is what you need
To put your funky hearts at ease

We funk, 'cuz G Funk blows my mind
You know that it's one of a kind
Can't you see, it's the LBC
And it sounds so funky
So funky, so funky, so funky

We come to funk the globe
So close your eyes and open your nose
G Funk is what you need
To put your funky hearts at ease

We come to funk the globe
So close your eyes and open your nose
G Funk is what you need
To put your funky hearts at ease
