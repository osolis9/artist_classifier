Do-You-Feel-Me:Young Cellski
I'm juss a young nigga with a 9, don't know how to act
You bound to get smoked if you don't get jacked
I need some dank so I can keep calm
Cause with the 9 in my palm makes me think about Vietnam
I be thinkin bout goin nuts
Cause the stress on my mind makes me think when I was growin up
A nigga couldn't even sleep!
Cause in my dreams I used to see niggas tryna creep 4 deep
I don't know what's wrong with my braincells
Is it the chronic or the muthafuckin pain pills?
Just like a nigga on lock-down thinkin about
All these niggas that I did shot down but um
I don't let it get to me, bro
To get the stress of my mind I get a 4-0
Biggitybang, biggitybuck, biggitybow-bow
That's how it sounds when I let off 30 rounds
You better run and hide when I let loose, mayne
Cause that's the consequences took up in the dope game
Niggas dyin young over little punk shit
Funking with each other cause there's no-one else to funk with
Even my niggas from back in the days ain't my niggas no more
Cause you know how niggas change
It used to be "Wasup my nigga?" now it's just a straight mug
Cause all the niggas I grew up with is straight thugs
But um, I cop game from these OGs
I watch niggas count G's and cook whole keys
And you wonder why a young nigga game is tight
Cause my folks turned a nigga up wrong from right
And you wonder why I keep the 9 and the vest
Because the dank keep a nigga more and more stress
And what I'm spittin is some shit that's straight real, G
And I'm axing you niggas, can you feel me?

And if you feel me then

(How does it feel mane!?)

x8

I'm stayin at home with the chrome, with the lights out
Cause I capped some niggas that was muggin me on rand-off
And my bucket hit the back cuts to avoid
The fucking po-po's cause they got me paranoid
They ain't stoppin nuttin gots to get my money on
Still with my niggas mobbin 4 deep gettin gone
Taking (?) and dankin me the energy to bust caps
Makin sure them niggas that I bust at ain't gone bust back
Cause them niggas tried to put hands to (?)
From hollow point lead from this tec-9 infrared
Cause niggas can't (?) one shot then you're hit
Cause when the mac spits that ceases talkin bullshit
Cause where I come from you got to stay strapped with a 9
Cause 17 shots in south shootin a deuce-five
The muthafuckin night and these muthafuckin HKs
Make niggas bow off the Frisco niggas don't play

Cause when it's funky up in Frisco, niggas locced up
Cause when the bang is on, niggas wanna smoke ya
Do or die is the attitude niggas got

So when I plot you better listen to the gunshots

Boom-boom-boom, ratatata is the sound of the mac
Spit some shit that even make my own niggas step back
Cause um, I'm comin straight real G
And I'm axin all my niggas, do you feel me?

And if you feel me then buck him, buck him down-down
And if you feel me then buck him, buck him down-down
And if you feel me then fuckin buck him down-down
Straight from the Fogtown, and fuck a fucking dogpound
I'm in this, Young Cellski-a
Buck him, buck him down straight
From P-Fogtown niggas lay down when I
Pull me SIG 9 millimeter
I buck him, buck him down cause I don't need ya
Cause I'm a young nigga
Bussin, bussin caps-a
At them niggas 'specially when I snap-a
Off the tanqueray and dank I be trippin
And you know I got the Glock and I'm never slippin, buck-buck!
Niggas gots to feel me G
For 1994, ye, this Young Cellski and I'm out like dat mane
(Fuckin bustas)
