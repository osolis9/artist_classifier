My deejay's funky

Def and mighty, supernatural rappin'
Ace boon coon ski never back-stabbin'
Don't give a fuck about what you heard
First name Schoolly, last name D, word

80 Dollar shirt and my 100 dollar sneakers
Gemini mixer and some PB speakers
Turnin' out parties everywhere that we go
And peepin' all the hoes at the end of the show

I say one thing, he says another
What's that word you be sayin', muthafucka?
I guess it's alright, man, I don't care
But I might scare your mama out her underwear

Fresh, fres
100 Dollar Filas on, it got to be fresh
Jammin' to a beat just got to be fresh
See a fly young lady, she got to be fresh
The things I said to her, you know they had to be fresh

I said, "Fly lady, now you got a big butt"
Thinkin' to myself, I need to bust me a nut
Let's go some place and you give me some smut
She looked me up and down, I was out of my luck

Man, what the fuck there a whole copy breed

And then a pimp pulled up in a Caddy Seville
Put my hand on my nuts when I started to ill
Nigga saw what I was doin' and he started to chill
Didn't wanna be pushin' daisies off some hill

So all you mothers and you fathers, with due respect
I know you have to worry when I got the kids in check
Because the shit I'm sayin', dudel, you did it too
I pull a microphone, 212122

Well, I'm a tell you a story never ever been told
About the 52-crew, so bright, so bold five M C's with mic's in their hand
Could you rhyme with a hell of a man?
Deejay Lynn on the mix guaranteed to put you all in a blizz

If you're out there dancin' on the floor in the fix
I let you all know I'm not talkin' shit
'Cause I'm always rappin' never, never rockin' the beat
First name Schoolly, last name is D

Code money

I know you're wearin' gold but you're eatin' popcorn
Always rappin' never, never rockin' the beat
First name is Schoolly, last name is D

Ha, we gon' do somethin' for ya you know
I got my block hair cut, you know, I got my silk shirt
And my Filas on I got my tailor-made jewels
There's somethin' I gotta say before I go and it go like this

You know we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix
And all the other M C's get off of our dicks
Because we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix
And all the other M C's get off of our dicks

Because we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix
And all the other M C's get off of our dicks
It's that Coqui 900, can I have me a sip
Yeah, I get real high, start talkin some shit

And if the shit ain't hot, you know that it's it
And then I meet a fly lady, you're lookin' real slick
And then I take you in the back, I give you a kiss
And then I kiss you in the places that I just won't miss

Because we rock, we roll,  we jam and we mix
And all the other M C's get off of our dicks
Because we rock, we roll, we jam and we mix
And all the other M C's get off of our dicks
