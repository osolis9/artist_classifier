[Hook - Laurie Walker] Something changed when you came into view/ My beautiful, wonderful you/ You don’t know what you for me/ You make me believe in God/ God/ God/ You let me believe you’re/ My angel/ You let me believe in God

[Verse 1] I never thought that I could ever be a part of something so magnificent/ I feel I must’ve known you in another life/ wanna cherish every minute with you/ I mean, your features like lookin’ in the mirror/ So uncanny that I’m asking can it be the real thing, I mean I’m not prepared for this level of emotion/ I’ll admit, I’m scared/ To pick you up, they put you in my arms/ Looking down at you, see you looking up/ Your eyes pierce straight through my soul, and I’m frozen, I’m really shooken up/ Can’t believe you’re mine, can’t believe I’m cryin’/ You are so divine, from the bottom of your feet to your head, with your little curl/ Welcome o the world/ It’s my baby girl

[Hook]

[Verse 2] Awestruck again/ I can see your skin color coming in/ As I proceed to take you to the incubator room, and I’m nervous in my stomach, wonderin’/ I’ve never looked at human life in this position/ This isn’t my typical disposition/ Started to hear a voice in my spirit, decided that I would sit and give it a listen/ Telling me to be not afraid of the road ahead and where it may turn/ As the doctor pulls me aside to notify me that she had a few concerns/ The I see you, NICU, and I see ME in that glass/ And I’m scared to death, but I know somethin’, I ain’t givin’ up that fast/ This is a celebration of ya life/ Your vibration is too high to try to hold it down/ Look up at the sun, lil’ mama, let the ladybug fly/ Couple weeks later, look at you/ Welcome home, Jada, this ya room/ You so magnetic the planet can’t even handle it/ You such a star, you make me believe in God
