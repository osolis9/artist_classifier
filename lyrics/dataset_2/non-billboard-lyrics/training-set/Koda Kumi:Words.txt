I know that you lied to me
Using just your words to shatter me
Your words are like a dream
But dreams could never fool me
It's not right to me

I'm acting so distant now
Turned my back as you walked away
But I was listening
That you fight your battles far from me
It's not right to me

"Don't you worry 'cause I come back"
I could hear you speaking as
You walked to battle
I acted strong
To hide the pain when I
Turned back the pages
Crying out a windy answer
What if I shed my tears and
Begged you not to leave?

But now I'm not afraid to do
What's in my heart

Those thousand words
Have never been spoken
So far away
I'm sending them to you wherever you are
Suspended on shiny wings
Those thousand words
Have never been spoken
They'll treasure you
Make you no longer dare seem
So far away
And hold you forever

That dream isn't over yet
I pretend and say, "I can't forget"
I still live in my day
You've been there with me all the way
It's not right of me

"Don't you worry 'cause I'll write to you"
I could see you speaking as
You looked away
I acted strong
To hide the love when I
Turned back the pages
Anger might've been the answer
But if I shook my head and said
That I can't wait

But now I'm not afraid to do
What's in my heart

Those thousand words
Have never been spoken
So far away
I'm sending them to you wherever you are
Suspended on shiny wings
Those thousands words
Have never been spoken
They'll treasure you
Make you no longer dare seem
So far away
And hold you forever

Those thousand words
Have never been spoken
La la la la
I'm sending them to you wherever you are
Suspended on shiny wings
Those thousands words
Have never been spoken
La la la la
Make you no longer here
Feel like calling me
La la la...
