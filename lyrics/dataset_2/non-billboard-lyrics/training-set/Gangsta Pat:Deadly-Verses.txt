Deadly-Verses:Gangsta Pat
Deadly ass verses
We droppin this shit like bombs
These niggas be talkin that shit
And I wonder right up if they know they can't get none
Deadly ass verses
We droppin this shit for you ho's
The villin is now in effect
Hey yo pat nigga show em how you gunna flow

The villin is chillin
I'm plannin
And I'm killin you niggas for sport
And I'm tackin your life
And I'm leaving you dead on the side
Why cause I had no
2 way shootin and killin them niggas for nothin
See I don't know how in the fuck I got in it I really don't know
Started up all of this shootin
But I
Know that
I finish this so I pop
I clip in my Glock and I spray
Through everyone I saw fall
Bustin out of the club through the window with my bloody Glock
It in my draws
Takin no prisoners
Leavin no witnesses
This nigga is body this fucking song
I'm puttin my bloody Glock in his mouth and he's rappin his lips so real my gun
Scroovin and movin and groovin
I blow and I lettin you now
When I'm ruthless
I shot with the villin is chillin
And I'll kill em for nothin
For real and my nigga
And I ain't goin
Bustin up out this
Some sprints on a nigga that tried me
But he didn't last
He was writing a paycheck
With his mouth
His sissy couldn't cash
Are you trick
Niggas be thinkin the villins a sucku
But I don't give a fuck
When I bite my bottom lip you bitches better duck
Any mother fucker that defies me will end up riding in a hearse
I don't give a single cause on a deadly fuck
That's why I wrote this deadly verse

Deadly ass verses
We droppin this shit like bombs
These niggas be talkin that shit
And I wonder right up if they know they can't get none
Deadly ass verses
We droppin this shit for you ho's
The gangsta is now in effect
Yo my nigga show them how you gunna flow

I'm bustin they flow
And ya know
When I'm goin
I love when I come with that wicked style
Robbin they killas
Since I can remember
Cause see I was born as a wicked child
Comin up out of the grave
Nothin could save
You wanna start and get bucked
I'm rippin and flippin that shotgun
I'm back on attackin
I really don't give a fuck
Smokin that chronic
And feelin bionic
I'm smoked straight out off in another time
I might be insane
I'm keepin my game
I feel like I'm goin straight out of my mind
Pull out my nine
Cock it one time
Put it right up on the side of my head
Should I let me live
Or should I pull
The trigger and fill
Myself full of lead
Am I really ready for suicide
I know and I wanna just go there
But if it's not what I think it is
What if they won't let me flow there
What if they won't let me keep me your number
Outside when I'm ready to fall now
I guess I just gotta straight come
And drop you a bone when it's time to all out
I'm trippin and clippin and flippin
The niggas that wanna ride up and get bucked out
Bitches be talkin that shit
But they suckin my dick
In the end they get fucked out
Niggas that fuck with they G
They must love to get haled off in hearses
They don't understand I'm the man
And I'm droppin these deadly ass verses

Deadly ass verses
We droppin this shit like bombs
These niggas be talkin that shit
And I wonder right up if they know they can't get none
Deadly ass verses
We now we talk on the left up
My nigga lets flip the script
And rock this funky shit together

Can't nobody fuck with us
Niggas that know they can't get none
But what if they think that they can
Why don't they run up and try to come get some
Deadly ass verses we droppin these lyrics for all of you ho's
The villin is now in effect
Hey yo pat nigga show em how your gunna flow

I'm poppin my clip in my Glock
An I'm bustin up all of my councils
Til I see you fallin
I'm rappin out of this thing
Cause I'm hiding my bloody Glock deep inside my draws
And I'm leaving you all out
And this is for all of my bitches I have picked up in a heist
I'm am a bad nigga
Stoppin the flow and irruptin
And I'm lettin you know I'm nothin nice

Can't nobody fuck with us
Niggas that know they can't get none
But what if they think that they can
Why don't they run up and try to come get some
Deadly ass verses we droppin these lyrics for all of you ho's
The gangsta is now in effect
Yo my nigga show them how your gunna flow
I'm killin and stealin for money
I'm keepin my nine up
I'm somebody's face
If they move I'm gunna blast
And I'm kicken they ass
And I'm takin they shit
But they catch me a murder case
Niggas that know
They can't fuck with the gangsta
If they do I kill them and leave them for dead
I watch cause I'm on top with my Glock
I don't stop
I just pop
And rake shop
When I droppin a deadly verse
