Guilty
Your always to busy
Why dont you go with me
Dont act like you dont hear me
Neglected
Your guilty
He noticed no one was with me
I started getting so friendly
He told me I was to pretty
I flirted
I'm guilty

I have no reason to lie
I told you a thousand times
I needed you be my side, but you were nowhere to be found
But you pushed your luck
Now it's all messed up
Cuz you went to far when you broke my heart and I found my guy
And if losin you is what I gotta do to satisfy all my needs
Then I guess that makes me guilty

Stop wonderin a thing but
I want you so bad it's danger
Its true I'm nobody's angel
Convict me
Guilty
You aint no...
So good for...
It's not like I did it on perpose
The verdict is nuthing
He needs me
