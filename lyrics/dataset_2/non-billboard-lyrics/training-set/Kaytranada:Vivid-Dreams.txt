In a dream I can see you crystal clear
When I’m awake I begin to disappear
In a dream I can see you crystal clear
When I’m awake I begin to disappear

She’s burning here below my mind
The green and purple smoke it rises, rises
As every hidden wish collides
Those illusions but I can’t deny it
She’s burning in below my mind
The green and purple smoke it rises, rises
As every hidden wish collides
I’m falling and I can’t deny it
I’m falling and I can’t deny it
I’m falling and I can’t deny it
I’m falling and I can’t deny it
I’m falling in…
