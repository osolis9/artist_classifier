Black-Pyramid:Poetic Death
Organized Threat, that's all it is son
So let it be written, so let it be done

The curse of the Black Pyramid/
Light some candles and scribble this/
In the blood of all my enemies/
This movement is the masterpiece/
Got hollow points for you MCs/
Get the fuck up out my facial/
I'm the prophet sent to Babylon/
I convinced Cain to kill Abel/
A shooting star/
Manifestation/
Pirate ships in my basement/
Got a chest of hidden mysteries/
And a body bag of Masons/
I'm the wizard in the dragon's mouth/
And my thrown in made of spell books/
My staff is black obsidian/
I've cursed the souls of many men/
I'm back bitch/
The Black Prince/
Bringing advanced philosophies/
I'm the renegade like Jesse James/
With a pocket watch and envy/
You should have never underestimated/
The villains of the story/
Cause for the glory (shit)/
Whatever's necessary my dude/
I give a fuck about a fan base/
We're saluting the cult following/
Got a black robe with a black hoodie/
Sayeth the Lord/
So follow me/

Scarecrow hieroglyph/
Anuin the manuscript/
Take a hit of this and/
What do you see/
Could lose your life/
Or pay the piper/
Bullets from a sniper/
The body of a kid/
In the Black Pyramid/

Ayo I politic like Martin Luther/
But I operate like Malcolm/
Or the chief of an Indian tribe/
Scalp them with the scalpel look/
If it ain't O.G.T/
I ain't really trying to hear it/
And let's be honest/
You're bandwagon off the hard work/
We're putting in/
Peace to my nigga Mega yo/
We treat this like a gang though/
So claim your loyalty/
Or step the fuck up out my way ho/
The street code/
I'm operating regardless if you're feeling me/
Cause even the deft dumb and blind/
Can understand the victory/
Plus I'm highly intellectual/
With a nice amount of arrogance/
Immaculate/
I'll illuminate the stars/
Throughout the daylight/
They've been waiting on my return/
So address me as the general/
I'll convert the dark spiritual/
Into silhouettes and fallen angels/
Quoth the raven/
A paradox within my paradigm/
And my legacy is infinite/
Through calculations intricate/
And Jesus walked on water/
But I chose to walk the pyramids/
I'm Doctor Sues on Ritalin/
The curse of the Black Pyramid/
