If-I-Ever-Needed-Someone:Urban Mystic
Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You

See me through the daytimes
And through the lonely nights
To lead me through the darkness
And on into the light, oh yeah

Stand with me when I'm in trouble
And help me through my strife, oh yeah
When times get so uncertain
I turn to You in my life

Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You

Someone to hold onto and keep me from all fear
Someone to be my guiding light and keep me very near, yeah
To keep me from my selfishness, to keep me from my sorrow
To lead me on to givingness so I can see tomorrow

Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You

Someone to walk with
Someone to hold my hand, yeah
Someone to talk with
Someone to understand, oh yeah, yeah

To call on You when I need You
And I need You very much, oh yes I do
To open up my arms to You
And feel Your tender touch

To feel it and to keep it
Yes, right here in my soul
And then care for it and keep it with me
Never to grow old

Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You

Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
Oh Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
