[Short Circuit]
Yall Bounce Ya Yall Bounce Yall
Yall Bounce Yall Bounce Yall Bounce
[Ikeim]
You first heard of us on the Mean Green joint
Drop the first hot single now yall getting the point
We was here many years ago with same flow
If you seen us in your town probably doin a show
Keep it real and let you know it ain't all about dough
But it is about the kids with power to go
Mind ya own biz you don't like my flow
Find a spot to live cause the bomb gon' blow
We like spiderman superman and friends
Come to coliseum and slam these jams
Lil' Soldiers my controllers what messin with that
Ikeim and Freequan real brothers at that Yeah

Ain't life there all it is is love here
