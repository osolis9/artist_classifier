Sunshine-live-:Floetry
(Floesist)
You know sometimes we um we dont recognize our dreams inside our
realities, and other times were not aware of exactly whats real, we walk around
daydreaing but the sun is shining, the sunshine always is

Chours
I just wanna see my lovely sunshine, i just wanna bring back all of
my blue skies, and if you take away my rainbow i will cry (cry) cry (cry)
give me back my sunshine.

(songstress)
Dreaming in my state of being and i see you smiling so happy
just laughing and standing strong, im missing you right here
listen to my tears, im waking up to skies so gray im needing
you to brighten up my day

(Floesist)
Listen
Catch your breath cool out you need to calm down, lets concentrate
dont go making all your time run out, see your ok it looks much worst than
it really is and you'll pull through come on you know how we be doing
this, its me and you yo promised you cant pull out now, were friends
for life so you cant just sell me out, we shared alot but you
know we'll see to so much more our wedding day and the children
that we prayed for

Chorus

(songstress)
i used to depend on your eyes to show me the way that i should go
my reality is blurry im afraid of being all alone your light has been
my guide through out the good and bad i wish that i had spent a little
more attention to my one and only sunshine

(floesist)
Listen, listen
i'll never leave you, yo i swear that on my grave, damn whats that im
feeling dizzy kinda getting faint it aint nothing didnt sleep that
much last night from watching over you but no im cool im fine
