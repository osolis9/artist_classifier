Grew up in a world full of thieves
The son of Earl & Louise
Yearning for greed, I was working for me
My pops died on the train tracks, whites left him lay flat
Cause my mama fell in love with a man with shade black
My dadd died on a train’s track
He probably got his brain craked
Scar as a little kid 
Thought about Law School
But that’s not what niggaz did
Cracked ass teach thought Carpentry is what it is
My hair was red,no kind of colouring
Shiny shoes suffering
So I started hustling
My job wasn’t cutting it
I couldn’t fuck with it
Servin’ ight people wasn’t me
I had enough of it
Fell in love with ….,cool cats
All country boys in cool suits and …I got drunk, smoke weed,having numbers
And some skinny …,I was a bad brother
…she went crazy when that man dumped her
Dream of a Cadillac bumper
Thinkin’ back to blame it all on my lack of parents
Hanging up –town,see me master pimpin’
Red Fox cleaning kitchens ,he was stacking dishes
Man,listenI have fire from smalls
I had to prove a point
Everybody knew Detroit

Detroit Red,my name is Detroit Red

Man,I was on the cop’s hit list
Never sent list
Drop arms cause a pig was searching my…
This was way before Bill Ruseel was on Cellitichs
Started doing stick-ups
Sammy tried to kill me
Cause I smacked his bitch up
The West Indian Man with good memory
He will kill you in a heartbeat
Cause he tried to spot me ,wrongly
Got back to Boston
He assured me he was rocking
Sophie and her sister were down
I brought another guy,Rudy,in the project
I had to set it straight so I knew there wasn’t a problem
He wasn’t afraid to die
He was …
And empty gun with the bullets he had inside it
Silence covered the room
I had it quiet
Put the slug back in gun like a deposit
Pop it,nothing came out,I started smiling
Did it again,it was astonished
But little did they know I had the bullet in my pocket
Then we started robbing handbags and jewelry boxes
Going in the houses sneakier than the mouse is
Money out of wallets
Clothes out of closets
People when they snored, they lifted all up and took the watches
Door started knocking
We were caught by the coppers
Judge getting… but not because of my charges
It’s cause Sophie and her sister look like his daughters
I hate prison cause I see it as a slave system
So good,shit will be painless
Long boosting in Harlem
You know what my name is
