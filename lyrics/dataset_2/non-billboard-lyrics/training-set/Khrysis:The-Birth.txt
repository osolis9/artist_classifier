[Verse]
Yo, I saw a light they put me inside a towel
I heard a voice say "what a beautiful child"
Then I seen my mother's heavenly smile
The world stole it I ain't seen it in a while
But now I sing songs that make points you scoreless
Ding dong ditch was left on death's doorstep
Moreless feeling like life is tryna to end mine
And I'm between love and hate like a thin line
Back at it like crack addicts with bad habits
The name's Add but I was bad at mathematics
Looking back at my bad times and laugh at it
They say life is a test and I'm trying to pass at it
My friend told me his in-laws is outlaws
They cop cars then "WOOP WOOP" it's cop cars
I say the trap is a trap like Admiral Ackbar
My father kneeled to the floor and say Allahu Akbar
So whenever my mind thinks my ink's goddess
White lines and black thoughts and grey matter
Pyjama niggas be staying within the same pattern
I'm heart stopping but I'm resurrecting Hank Gathers
Sometimes I'm heated I feel like I need to vent
Like what if I missed my time? What if it came and went?
Spending all of my money and shit ain't been making sense
Got my diploma and broke as them niggas that never went
But, other than God tell me really who you gotta fear?
My granny's eyes probably cried for a 100 years
With no legs I could run it for a 100 years
I been savage no Wonder Years
You gotta be a little sicker be a little quicker
Your broad a little thin she gotta be a little thicker
Be yourself get a Snicker, your Army can't harm me
Baby boy I'm Snoop Dogg, fuck your fort lil nigga
