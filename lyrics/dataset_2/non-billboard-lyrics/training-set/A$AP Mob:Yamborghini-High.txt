[Verse 3: A$AP Ant]
My mama told me save that money, bank accounts, don't spend that bread
Cash out on new necklaces, 14 karat bracelet
Dibble dabble with the lean
Hi-Tech with the cream soda
As I whipped the yola
Lambo red, Coca Cola
My bros, Cosa Nostra
Ridin' on a speedboat
She suckin dick and deep throat
Rey Mysterio
When I'm jumpin' off the top rope
Banana clip with the scope
Wearin' all white
Like I'm the mothafuckin' pope

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
I'm on a Yamborghini high, flyin' high through the sky, hey yo
Yammy's vision got us rich, catch a nigga flyin' by in a Lambo
Sippin' the Henny got me gone, now I'm gettin' in my zone, hey yo
R.I.P. to my nigga, the gallon goin' to my dome, hey yo
This how it feel to be rich, fuckin' bitches in the mix, yeah
Where the chiquitas is at? Yamborghini with the shits, yeah
Lil Newport lit, Young Lord with the shits, yeah
I ain't with the game, bitch, she blow my cartridge, yeah
My Jewelry glistening why I’m always chilly
Can't believe a nigga made a couple milli'
'Bout to cop the house way up in the hillies
With a bad bitch in the Bentley
Wood grain with the roof gone
Make a bitch fold like a futon
Gettin' bread like a crouton
Tell me what the fuck is you on
