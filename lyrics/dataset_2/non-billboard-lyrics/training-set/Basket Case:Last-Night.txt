Last-Night:Basket Case
(INTRO: Mikey Styles)
Last night

Booming in ya trunk, it's booming in ya trunk
This is the sound when it's booming in ya trunk
Booming in ya trunk, it's booming in ya trunk
That's the sound when it's booming in ya trunk

(Mikey Styles)
We at the b-boy party (mashed up, mashed up)
Better grab ya honey, do the winey, winey
Mist-a Mikey, feelin typsy
Sipping on some cocoa, by cup rhyming(?)
This shroty, whispered to my ear
To break out to her crib
So this is exactly what we did
By the way her name is Precious
She pushes a cherry Lexus
Got crazy papers, 'cause at night she rumpshakas
It's all good
So I'm trying to knock the paisley
They couldn't get no dick, y'all niggas are chocolate
It's the return of the mack, me and my boys
Over here, it's true to dat
To all you playas hands up
Player haters hands down
Forever... trying... to think that you can hang now
Yo, I'm a big boy see, you woman ask, 'who he?'
I'm that rapping nigga with the fly bass
That be kicking it in ya baby (baby) baby (baby
Is it real enough?
Is it real enough?

(CHORUS: Mikey Styles)
I chill the back of the club
Cheer with the love, love
Sipping on Bud, puffing on buds
I chill the back of the club
Cheer with the love, love
Sipping on Bud, puffing on buds
I chill the back of the club
Cheer with the love, love
Sipping on Bud, puffing on buds

(Mikey Styles)
Last night, casually dressed... to impress
Looking for this princess
So peep the words I manifest
Bad boys on my block here smoke sease
Chilling at the bar, spending lucci on Moet
Chickenheads coming through to have some
Better come through with your digits hon
Your eyes on my shiny necklace, got you open
Like a gold digger miss
B-boys from my hood, we all ill
B-boys from all hoods chill (chill, chill, chill)
We all chill at the b-boy party (party)
Chill, we all chill at the b-boy party (party) 
(line echoed in background til end)
Player. Number 1. This is how we do
Know what I'm saying?
