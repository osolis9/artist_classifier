Falling:Cam Meekins
They say that they want the dude to play it cool
But, I told them that ain't me
But, I'm gonna beat the odds and I'll be on top
And be there like look at me
Yo girl I'm real no fake, no auto tune
No flex no game changing, lane changing
Rolling down 95 with no window pane changing
No tips for me
Everybody see my face and lamp city gon win that race
I gotta find a space to be me no strings attached
It's just me when I lay these raps and my story's true
Growing up just like you I'm 18 with amazing dreams
But, my mind is spinning and I'm going crazy
And my head feels like, feels like, feels like

I feel like I'm falling
To my knees, woah
I thought I had you calling
Cause you were running away from me
Like everybody else

Falling
To our knees, woah
I thought I had you calling
Cause you were running away from me
Like everybody else

So I started off like everybody else
I'm just trying to get my grind on
Now I look back I wasn't being me
Man, I was trying to get my shine on
Seen everybody in the rap game and I wanted to be like them
Running away from myself, I need some help
So no managers just friends
No second guessing I'm here for a reason dawg
I ain't dead yet cause I'm breathing dawg
If you think I'm running away
Well I guess I should start leaving dawg
Sike, I'm like cream of the crop
Tippity top, top of the pop
Never gonna stop but, in my mind
Feels like, feels like, feels like

Running away
