You get it back
You can't get it back
You get it back
You can't get it back

Verse one, when we begun
You know you had a sister all sprung
With your tongue
I thought you were my babe but no

When we laid
You always knew the right words to say
We got engaged
To be married the very next May

As the time moved on
The love we had got torn
You used to love me from dusk 'til dawn
But now you're trippin' from night 'til morn

Now you want me to change
I'm sick of you playin' these games
I'm tellin' you one thing
You wont get it back
You won't get it back, this ring

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that

You get it back
You can't get it back

Verse two, now were through
Too much time's been wasted on you
But it's cool
Put the glass shoe on another young fool

I accept that you cramped
And you couldn't take the heat
So you stamped, now upset
Don't come back for nothin' that you left

As the time moved on
The love we had got torn
You used to love me from dusk 'til dawn
But now you're trippin' from night 'til morn

Now you want me to change
I'm sick of you playin' these games
I'm tellin' you one thing
That you wont get it back
You won't get it back, this ring

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that

Boy, let me tell you this
Don't you know you can't get back
What you put in this relationship?
That includes this ring
'Cos I know I can't get back
All my kissin', huggin', lovin', [Incomprehensible]

We had a happy environment, I put on this diamond
I gave you my all and even met your requirements
Now you're goin' out, cheatin' and you're comin' up smilin'
You can say what you want but you ain't gettin' this diamond

You ain't gettin' this ring back, you tiptoed
You been livin' a stranger, just keep ya zipped closed
Did you really think that, that you can take me for a ride?
If you knock on my door, you know we're gonna collide

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my love and I can't get it back
Gave you all my time and I can't get it back
Now the ring that you gave me, you can't have it back
'Cos it's just not goin' down like that

Gave you my time and I can't get it back
Gave you all my love and I can't get it back
Now the things that you gave me, you want them back
But it's just not goin' down like that
