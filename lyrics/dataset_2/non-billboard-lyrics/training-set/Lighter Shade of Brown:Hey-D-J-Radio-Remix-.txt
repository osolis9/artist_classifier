Hey-D-J-Radio-Remix-:Lighter Shade of Brown
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Now what you hear is not a test
It's from ol' school to new school comin' back with a twist
It's the Lighter Shade bringin' back the funky rhythm
Time to show 'em what I give 'em, show 'em how I use to live 'em
Back in the days before hip hop departed
No more disco fever, John Travolta finished what he started
Walkin' down the street with ya ghetto blaster bumpin'
And thumpin', break beat always urge to rap somethin
Now a days, you got a new type of flavor
A certain rap behavior, Lighter Shade returns the favor
I'm giving props to all D.J.'s
That play the ol' funk, ya know how we play
And as the MC let the freestyle funk flow
Every once in a while they make the crowd scream, "Ho"
Jumpin' around wasn't the thing that they did
Steady bobbin' their head while the girls had said
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Can I get a dang dang, a ringa, dang digga, digga digga, dang dang
A ringa dang digga digga as I swing to the ol' school
Funk '94 bump, pop it in your trunk
And lay back and relax for a while
As I kick it to this smooth, dope style
And commence a get you in the mood
Move to the groove 'cause you know your gonna do it
A checka, checka, checka, check it out
Step right up and see what the Shade is all about
Who the flava, I'm the flava, and I came here just to save ya
With a bit of the same ol' that you heard
Huh, now can I get a word
As I'm goin', goin', gone
Hey, D.J., come on and play me that funky song
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Now I remember around the way back, back in the day
I use to know a D.J. who could mix it, wicked
Pick it up, pick it up like check, one two
Only now there's just more than a few rappers
MC's, who boast and they brag
A bag full of hits 'cause the Shade will never lag
As I rip it, I wreck it so check it
Yo, D, bust a fat rhyme for the fat record
Hippty hop, what it's the loco, peep the gam
To the PG and the vocals
As I reminisce over this and that yo, oh
Where we gonna take 'em, way back
Like I said before and I'll say it again
It's the ol' school versatile flex when we band
Eel skill that we got, you know we got mad
Props, so play me that funky song
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
Hey D.J., just play that song, keep me dancin' all night long
