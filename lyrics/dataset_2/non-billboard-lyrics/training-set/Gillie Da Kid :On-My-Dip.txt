On-My-Dip:Gillie Da Kid 
I am on my dip
I am on my dip
I am on my dip
You see I am going ..
I am so blow I don’t know if I can make it home
I am on my dip i am smoking on that loud
They call me mister .. we are gonna do karate
She gonna do me .. she ain’t got no change
We are not the same
These boys are stilling .. they see i am chilling

But i don’t slip ..- bottles of rose
Bottles ... everybody drunk who wants another round
I am so blow I don’t know if I can make it home
I am on my dip I am on my dip…
I am so blow I don’t know if I can make it home
I am on my dip I am on my dip …
