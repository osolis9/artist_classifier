Family-Man:Azeem
Everybody goes to work
Their computers, their saws, jackhammers
We use the tip of the tongue, the teeth, and the lips
I use the tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the, tip of the, tip of the, teeth
The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the, tip of the, tip of the...
Let me tell you about it
I got this girl, she's a harlot, man, everybody want her
Her name is Mary and her last name is Cali Chronic
Her style, it varies, since I was young I used to call her
Since then at night I like to kiss her and get up on her
We fell in love, she seduced me, her mood is soothin
That's how I met my second wife, her name is Rebel Music
Her and Mary get along just fine
We all had this child, his name is Rhymes
I use the tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the, tip of the, tip of the, teeth
The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips, the lips...
Yo, let me tell y'all about my situation
My other wife, her name is Music, she's all dogged up
Any type of free pleasure, baby gal disrupts
Always fiendin for travel all across the lands
From Oakland to New York City, Texas, France
Before I knew it she's flirtin with six stage hands
She wanted mic chord, speakers, electric amps
And a man to carry her bags and order her rice
Beggin Headcrack to play her on the radio twice
(Damn) I remember them days long past
She was a simple woman and we would just hold hands
There wasn't one care in the world that we had
Just me and music, chillin alone in the pad
Now she's an all-night tweaker, smoke more reefer
Than a top-notch dreadlock Rastaman preacher
Still I get with her and got no choice neither
Can't please her, she's always sayin love her or leave her
I use the tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the, tip of the, tip of the, teeth
The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, tip of the, tip of the...
Teeth, the tongue, the lips
Tip of the, tip of the, teeth, the tongue
The tip of the, teeth, the teeth, the tongue
Tip of the, teeth, the tongue, the tongue
The lips, the lips, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips
Love her or leave her alone
Make love to the music
Produce children named songs
Small castles, big empires
Hydroponic Sound System
Big pen push big poems
