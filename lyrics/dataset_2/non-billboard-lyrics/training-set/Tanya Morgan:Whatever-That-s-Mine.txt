Whatever-That-s-Mine:Tanya Morgan
Haters sipping consistent
Dont let nobody owe you shit
We have been . by since 606
They have been on my backside they wont quit
My math is on we are a . crash the 
Still the . now travel the horse are you still . man
Why are you . and calling me I aint studying your 
Big man on a campus shit fresh coat white man on campus
Feeling that you gave when you know you are killing him
. wiping hard from give a shit
Nothing . saint of a . thats digger shit
The best down the . only you can resist the gut . the shit
chorus
I stepped out the house today and what you do with it I am wear out today
I stepped out the house today and what you do with it I am wear . out today
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
Playing aint an option now
You set it up now you got to . down
Feeling good feels better when you awake better
And the only way the . being a quitter
You got the worst . in your life . just to make things right
And I dont care how good a wife they say it is
Aint . improvements could she
Never got comfortable losing
I realize success is intrusive
And I enjoy be any lousier
But I can prove shit if you cant . this
Dots in my . you got to fill them invisible

chorus
I stepped out the house today and what you do with it I am wear out today
I stepped out the house today and what you do with it I am wear . out today
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
Even if you . sun they will label you
I fly capable dont ask take it to something they aint telling you
It aint try to hard in the truth like I have read that
And I kept going see is no . back I left that sped up .
Still work . on till I get what I deserve
Told my kids to have a down as white 
Give me whats mine
Got to work a little more than the rest
Thats fine
Got other baddie the one I feel left off for days
Get out my head I wanna hear my own voice instead
Get out respect I want it all every single 
Got it bad
chorus
I stepped out the house today and what you do with it I am wear out today
I stepped out the house today and what you do with it I am wear . out today
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
And I am out to get whatever thats mine
