Fantasize:Floetry
I wanna do dumb things.
I'm talking: strolling-in-the-park things. Stealing kisses straddled on park swings in the daylight while the ice cream van sings little melody like...
Twa da da dum...Da da da da dum...

See, I want to- (Wooo-ooooh)
And I was thinking we could-(said whaat baaaaby)

And if you're ready we could always--(Oh oh oh baaaby yeah yeah)
See-
"I Fantasize...(uh huh)

everyday (everyday)
and I want to do just everything...
(thing for ya)
Said, Baby
(thing with ya)
said everything.
(everything)
And...I, I, I Fantasize about you,
Said everyday & I want to do just everything. Said, Baby, said everything. "I Fantasize about you, everyday & I want to do just...
