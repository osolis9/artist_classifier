What-s-Your-Name:Don Juan
What's your name? I have seen you before
What's your name? May I walk you to your door?
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ee

What's your name? Is it Mary or Sue?
What's your name? Do I stand a chance with you?
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me
Ooh-ee, ooh-ee, ooh-ee

I stood on this corner waiting for you to come along
So my heart could feel satisf-i-ied
So please let me be your Number One
Under the moon, under the stars, and under the sun

Oh-oh, what's your name? (what's your name?) Is it Mary or Sue?
What's your name? Do I stand a chance with you?
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me
Ooh-ee, ooh-ee, ooh-ee

What's your name?
What's your name?

Shooby-doo-bop-bah-dah!
