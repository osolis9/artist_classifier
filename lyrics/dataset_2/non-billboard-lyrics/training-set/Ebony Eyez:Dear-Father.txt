Dear-Father:Ebony Eyez
[Intro]
Dear Father are you wit me?
I jus hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I jus hope these prayers'll fix me
Dear Father are you wit me?
I jus hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I jus hope these prayers'll fix me
[Verse 1]
Say i dont walk right, i dont talk right
I dont eat right, I dont sleep right
What i do right? Who said you right?
Hell with do right, id rather do life
And by tha way pops, i aint forgot about it
Hold my chin up, see i dont pout about it
And when i see you dont think i aint thought about it 
But chu know how we do, we jus talk around it
And my last partner, she done went astray
So when i see her in tha club, i dont know what to say
I might be gone tomorrow but im hurr today
And i guess this ought to really matter anyway
Tryna clear ma mind, so i can write this rhyme 
Been on tha phone with my man and i know he liein
And at the same time, shit i know he tryin
At the same time, i know hes tryin
[Chorus]
Dear Father are you wit me?
I jus hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I jus hope these prayers'll fix me
Dear Father are you wit me?
I jus hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I jus hope these prayers'll fix me
[Verse 2]
Car leakin oil plus i need a muffler 
Now that aint no way to live for a baby mother
Off to tha clinic how'd they miss my cycle? 
And my family wonder why im actin spiteful
Test came back, (Shhh) negative
I cant see myself dependin on my relatives
Was a close call, but yet and still, need to call my aunt
To help wit my electric bill, aint got no rest, too much stress 
Momma called said they found a lump on her breast 
Must be payback for the wrong i did
God please let her live to see her grandkids
Yeah i got furrst, yeah i cried turrs and so what 
I aint been to church in 5 yurrs
Only the man above got the right to judge 
And if my prayers go unanswered i wont hold a grudge 
[Chorus]
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
[Verse 3]
Shanda, Cayle, Coccoa, Nini... 
Your big sis got cha back if you need me
One day you might see me on TV
But dont ever think that chu would leave me
Cause life can make you or break you 
But even through tha hard times stay greatful
As for me i never took a hand-out
Dealt with tha situation never ran out
Id be liein if i said i never had doubts 
Alotta times i was down, feelin left out
Was on the outside lookin in
While other people seemed to have tha perfect blend
Just tryna figure what i need to do to win
Dont wanna end up sayin what i coulda been
So lord please i hope that you can hear my cries
This is tha letter to you signed Ebony Eyez
[Chorus]
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
[Outro]
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
Dear Father are you with me?
I just hope you dont forget me
I aint askin for no pity
I just hope these prayers will fix me
