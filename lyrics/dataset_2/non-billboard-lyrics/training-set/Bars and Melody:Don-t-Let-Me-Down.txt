Don-t-Let-Me-Down:Bars and Melody
I wanna show you a world, just let go,
what you gotta do is close your eyes, feel it flow
I'm trying to fight the pain, but I'm slowly falling,
you can try to run away, can you hear me calling?
I know that you're scared, so close your eyes
The pain will heal, no need to cry
I know that it hurts, I've felt it all
But no matter what happens, I wont let you fall

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down,
don't let me down, down, down

I'm sorry that I brought you here,
I wish that I could turn back time
But I can't seem to break you down
enough to make you change your mind
It's cold outside, so take my jacket
I'm used to it so you can have it
And I'm glad that you are here with me
so we can taste the heaven
I left you out in such a state
And after all, you still stay
I think that it is safe to say,
that we can now, call this fate
So if you're done, open up, this is what I'm for
Maybe I can find a way before we hit the floor

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down,
Don't let me down, down, down

Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah
Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh, no
Yeah, don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
