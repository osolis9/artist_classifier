Reunited-With-The-Block:Turk
Reunited with the block, man it feels so good
Yeah I’m back to the thugging man I’m keepin it hood
I don’t know no other way, anything else not real
Mano ill affiliated, man you know what it is
I go hard, so you know I strap with that still
If a nigga get wrong, bet his ass get killed
Man I did some jail time, a couple of years
Now it’s time for me to shine, I get a couple of mills
Take my niggas with me to the top, that’s how I rock puff
I take my dope habit, no more shots cause
No more wanting ones, I’m talking brown and white
Yeah that was many nights, I went on pented flights
Now I got plenty ice, my pockets super big
I hit a lick and maxed out, now I’m super rich
They call me superman, cause I fuck with superchicks
No kryptonite, straight raw, that whole 36
