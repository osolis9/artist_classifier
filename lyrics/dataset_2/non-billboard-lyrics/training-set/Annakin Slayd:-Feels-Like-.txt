-Feels-Like-:Annakin Slayd
I believe that it's meant to be
And it feels a little like '93
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
I believe we're right in the mix and it
Feels a little like '86
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
Here's a rap from the cradle of organized sports
Where we come together for a common cause
I remember number 24
Cheers busting out every house, every home
Hard to believe it was so long ago
And I know we got a long, long way to go
But I believe this city's got a chance to cop it
So I bust my Komisarek shirt and rock it
Spoke to the ghost of the Rocket
Told me once the wheels are in motion can't stop it
Yeah, I thought back to that ten minute O
When his tear drops blessed the Bell Centre floor
Put a lot of thought to what I'd rhyme about
How can I wrap my mind around?
Locking number 25 down
There has never been a better time than now
I believe that it's meant to be
And it Feels a little like '93
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
I believe we're right in the mix and it
Feels a little like '86
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
Let's party all night for the red, blue and white
And shine bright like the Place Ville Marie lights
It's been a hundred years, 1909
And in a quarter of that time we've paraded with pride
And if this year we win number 25
You can bet there'll be elated celebrating city-wide
Yeah, once in a while I pass by the Big O
And think since we lost our team we haven't been exposed
So I climb the tower, raise a glass up to the 'Spos
Then I snatch the torch and pass it to the ghosts
I know this 25th crusade won't fail
And we'll be sipping from the holiest of grails,
Yeah
Sometimes it's by the numbers we're defined
23, 11, 27, 10 and 9
And maybe number one if you're seeing the signs
Because this year I'm seeing and believing twenty-five.
I believe that it's meant to be
And it Feels a little like '93
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
I believe we're right in the mix and it
Feels a little like '86
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
I believe that it's meant to be
And it Feels a little like '93
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
I believe we're right in the mix and it
Feels a little like '86
With failing hands we hold it high
And raise number 25 to the sky
