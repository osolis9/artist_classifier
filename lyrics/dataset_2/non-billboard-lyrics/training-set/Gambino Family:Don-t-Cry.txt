Don-t-Cry:Gambino Family
[Fiend talking]
Yo, Yo
What's up to all my muthafuck soldiers,
My thugs, my warriors, my survivors out there
It's Fiend excited private wit' see-muthafuckin' Murder,
Q.B., Gotti, and Mr. Magic
When we hit 'em we hit 'em hard you heard me

Chorus [Fiend] 2X
Don't cry now
Nigga, don't wine now
We'll make it that yo people can't identify yo ass now

[Fiend]
Launched n missiles
And grams and pistols
Blastin' these things that whistle

Burnin' up shits you
And fuck it I won't miss you
A lethal weapon my profession
500 G's

500 G's that put inches n yo life
Surrounded by 500 please
Remember n grieves
That solider to beez

With a fro
I beents out smokin' trees
Hit tha Z's
Made 'em breeze

And blow to they knees
Ran over interstreets
By a tank on D's
I stank these

Wearin' some black chains and a safety
Why can't we just get along
I'm gettyon Jones
I'm known

For breakin' bones
Believin' that I ain't wrong
Introducin' yo shows
And a strong Whomp! Whomp!

[Chorus: x2]
Young niggas dyin' n my city
And I ain't showin' no pity
So I'm holdin' my head
Tryna keep from an early grave

Known as that "Path that's Laid"
Lord forgive me simple wayz
But I was lost and that game
Strapped n, through these tryflin' streets

Knowin' that tha "Breed of Life" might bury me
But I ain't worried, I'm holdin' chrome
Protectin' my dome
I'm trapped n a storm

Catched these folks that tryna do me home
Wit' crisis over my head
Nigga dodgin' tha FEDz
They rather see me n a cell

Nigga trapped n jail
I make bail
And me and Pheno raisin' hell

[Q.B.]
I represent Uptown
Make that wrong move you get bucked down
Dude, fuck now
Q.B. on that buck round

No hesitation, no status
Pack a nine automatic
And to pull a bullet to n yo family
Niggaz don't really want to see us rhyme

We puttin' niggaz on that news and givin' 'em motherfucking t.v time
Respect that name and that authority
And a nigga barged n tha same room so nigga naw wit' us uh
Q motherfucking B, we would never run

We back shit
Bitch niggaz get they back twisted
We crack shit
Niggaz need to get they fuckin' practice
Don't fuck wit' my crew and let us snatch this

[Magic]
I'm goin' raise hell motherfucker
Hope y'all ready for me
I can move with that night, I got veins on my teeth
I'm from that 9th Ward

Home of that killers and wig splitters
And lots of dead bodies
I heard a twelve-year hit it
I've been trained by that best

Bring yo cop killers
And I won't wear a vest
And you still facin' death
Don't cry now

Bitch nigga, don't wine now
'Cause I'm all up n you're shit
And you figure, you 'BOUT TO DIE!
Hold on, wait a minute, I smell pussy

Still wet behind that ears, lil' boy you still a fuckin' wookie
You messin' wit' a hard hitta
(automatics shooting)
You feel me nigger!

[Chorus: x4]

[C-Murder]
They label me a crazy muthafucka wit no hesitation
I'm a blast wit' a sawed off strip, to a niggaz ambition
I'm Bossalinie
And I roll wit' these TRU thugs

Givin' niggaz meanmugs
From tha ghetto I get much love
Ain't no motherfuckin' crosses
Wit' all these crime bosses

Nigga, Nigga, make a move
I'll have you sleepin' wit' dead dudes
My tattoos, represent my identity
It reveals that hard-will of a hard-kill nigga that's n me

My enemies on a rampage, tryin' avoid my presence
Fearin' immediate death, like a fateful pheasant
N my kingdom, only strong soldiers live, that's that law
Of that ghetto, I broke my hand on a fool's jaw

I'm southpaw
Hand to Hand combat, it's very necessary
My first option, is fightin' all my adversaries
That nigga flinched, when my motherfuckin' gun went "POW"
You heartless motherfucker, don't cry now

[Chorus: x6]

[Fiend talking again]
There, you motherfucking have it
Some of that youngest hard niggas and that motherfucking world
Understand this here
Us soldiers, No Limit Soldiers til' tha world blow up

Or a god show up
You heard me!
Don't cry now
If yo people can't identify yo ass now

hahaha...
Take me out this motherfucker
