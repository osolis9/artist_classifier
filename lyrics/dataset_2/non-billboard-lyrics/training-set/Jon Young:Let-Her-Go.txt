Let-Her-Go:Jon Young
Yea I'm back on my real shit with this one
Shout out passenger what up
(And you let her go)
Yeah sometimes man you just gotta let her go
Just make sure you let her go for the right reason
Know alotta you be on that shit like I gotta be single
I gotta go out every weekend that's cool and all but the grass ain't always greener ya know what I'm saying uh
Ya only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you's been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let go
When you let her go uh yeah
And you let her go
I let her go with no explanation
Conversation ended abruptly
her day turn from sunny to stormy
Shit hit the fan with no warning
Left her in tears just pouring
When I really feel I've been ignoring
I'm so caught up in this limelight
I'm lying bout a life
The club the bottles the models got me not thinking right
Acting single for the night
These women coming so easy man how can I ignore 'em
I try to fight it like a diet but I keep on feeding for 'em
So I show off who I really am
Chasing the wrong things started with a dream
ended up with some Stephen King
I wished I had turned right instead of that sharp left
I try to fill that void but I'm heart pressed
Been missing her like I been that missing that '90s rap
I'm trading in a good thing wish I could rewind back
My life is in a timelapse its passing me by
Just like the far side of money I'm running chasing that next high
Ya only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you's been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let go
When you let her go uh yeah
And you let her go
Yeah I left the feeling call me for now
But she better off see amigo right out the door this like a weight gone
Yea No more waiting on me late nights
All them shows out on the road flying home on those late flights
out there acting an ass
Just flying in with cash
Throw it in her face when she's mad
Shell be glad when its all in the past
And she moved on and all I got left is a story For a new song
That's all I care about though staying in the light
Chasing after fame trying to satisfy my appetite
Ignoring those close putting on a show
I rather buy round of bottles for some hoes
Showing off like I'm the man sprint club
Throwing bands up at my show just to watch them do they thang with no hands
Feeling grand till the next morning and I feel like shit
Never one to regret but I wish I could rewind this
Ya only need the light when its burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you's been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let go
And you let her go
