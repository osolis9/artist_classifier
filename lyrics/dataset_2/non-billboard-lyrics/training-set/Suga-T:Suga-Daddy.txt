Suga-Daddy:Suga-T
I got a Daddy with the first name Suga
Sprinklin' me with game, no I'm down for my booga
It's not a matter if you can catch a man, it's can you keep a man
And keep on payin' for the land

Daddy don't mind comin' out the pocket
He aah, pleases my clit and he know how to rock it, ugh
He's hella down for his grippin', I can't train him
I'm lovin' every man and others don't deserve this

You know that baller lean, that loves them sloppy scene
When back in the day he used to beat down dope fiends
Alias OG, original, he keeps his mug on me

And he's gotta straight extra nap and he keeps a fat sack
So aah, Daddy do that do that, doodoo dat dat dat, ooh
Ladies can you feel me? I got my Daddy's back
Like Bonnie and Clyde and you know that

Ladies can you feel me, you got your Daddy's back?
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)
And you know that
I know y'all can feel me, I got my Daddy's back
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)

Now ladies over here, do you got your Daddy's back?
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)
'Cos Daddy's hella down and he keeps a fat sack
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)

The mackin' don't stop until the bridge drop
So ahh, don't player hate just, give him his props
You gotta mind somebody
And I ain't gotta problem with mindin' my Suga Daddy

United we stand and together we fall
With the scratch and ball, we can all stand tall
Rockin', rollin', skatin' and bouncin'
I kill my lake and cloud like it ain't no stoppin'

My Daddy just called me and threw me a bird
A straight hustler, constantly puttin' in work
Yeah, much love to them BMW's
Black Man Working, they don't mind takin' care of you

Treatin' me like a queen, 'cos I serves him like a king
You know what I mean?
I know y'all can feel me
One love to them Suga Daddies, ugh

Ladies can you feel me, you got your Daddy's back?
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)
I know y'all can feel me, I got my Daddy's back
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)

All the ladies over here, do you got your Daddy's back?
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)
They be hella poppin', do you got your Daddy's back?
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)

I give my Daddy props, 'cos he's a show stoppin'
Worldwide gangsta in a gang of proppin'
Down to drop his top, comin' with some major plots
I got his back and he got mine and it means a lot

And when he swang his thang he says
"Suga, I love you, man", it's way cool
Bump with me and ride to this beat
And get a dose of this Suga Daddy

They be hella poppin', do you got your Daddy's back?
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)
Always down to ride, do you got your Daddy's back?
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)

Drop the top, 'cos I got my Daddy's back
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)
It be way cool, 'cos I got my Daddy's back
(Where they at, where they at, where they at?)
