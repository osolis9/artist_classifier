Boom-Bap:Diamonique
I can't pass the time but I know
If I let it go will pass me by
So I don't stand around,
I'm always working, fighting just to survive

You know I'm only human
Tear tracks fall from my eyes
I can only imagine
Better places in the blue skies

Boom fly away, take me high away
Everybody know that it's a better place
Boom boom get on the bus and ride
We're gonna have the best time of our life
I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Get on the bus and ride

I don't like to sell my tension,
When I needed some time
So I will buy to you because you're not buying me
I don't wanna make a crime

You know I'm only human
Tear tracks fall from my eyes
I can only imagine
Better places in the blue skies

Boom fly away, take me high away
Everybody know that it's a better place
Boom boom get on the bus and ride
We're gonna have the best time of our life
I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Get on the bus and ride

I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Get on the bus and ride

Get on the bus and
Get on the bus and
Get on the bus and
Get on the bus and

Boom fly away, take me high away
Everybody know that it's a better place
Boom boom get on the bus and ride
We're gonna have the best time of our life
I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
I want to fly away
Fly away, fly away, fly away
Get on the bus and ride
