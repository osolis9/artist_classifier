Pouring up a double shot of the Hennessy

I just wanna make you mine, baby girl I need you
On the floor we getting down, bumping and grinding
Spin your body all around, baby we gliding

Tryna get a new chain, gotta get the money
Finna cop a new ring, just a lil' something
Show these bitches I ain't playing, oh, that nigga Buddy
Back up on his shit again, then I hit my dougie
See your boy glistening, rain, snow, or sunny
Young nigga get it in
Filling up my cup and take a sip again
