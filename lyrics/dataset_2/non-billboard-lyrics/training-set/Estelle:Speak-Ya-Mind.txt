Speak-Ya-Mind:Estelle
I'm nice in my skin I love every color
I got the body God gave me don't want another
Well well I'm a woman it don't matter the shade
And what you really really want is a lady that's paid
Paid on that [?] not Ms. Ditsy Ditsy
Take these look good girls and miss me miss me
It's hard for young women also been in it myself
Shade shade shade and a man that [?]
And this is not an attack at them
I just want them to do better than they did with their [?]
I just wanted to advise [?]
I just wanted to pull out the Miseducation again
It's crucial times and we're here to base it
I gotta tell the truth y'all face it

All you gotta do is speak your mind and let em know
Tell em everything you meant to say but never said before
All you gotta do is
All you gotta do is
All you gotta do is speak your mind and let em know

Now what would happen if we got up and rejected
Demanded more for yourself they got to respect that
Well well I rejected it yup I rejected it
And all I had to do was speak my mind telling it
Telling my story now everybody's feeling it
[?] with a scenery
Now all my heroes they put me on a pedestal
I underestimated my worth I'm special
Most women have a thing and don't show it
The only difference is you you don't know it
Please don't blow it don't get on your knees sing
All I have to do is be me
And all we have to do is keep [?]
With with the unstoppable I'm taking what's mine

All you gotta do is speak your mind and let em know
Tell em everything you meant to say but never said before
All you gotta do is
All you gotta do is
All you gotta do is speak your mind and let em know
Let em know
Cause all you had to do is
All you had to do is
Say all you had to
Say all you had to
All you had to do is
All you had to do is
All you had to
All you had to
All you had to
All you had to

All you gotta do is speak your mind and let em know
Tell em everything you meant to say but never said before
All you gotta do is
All you gotta do is
All you gotta do is speak your mind and let em know
Let em know
