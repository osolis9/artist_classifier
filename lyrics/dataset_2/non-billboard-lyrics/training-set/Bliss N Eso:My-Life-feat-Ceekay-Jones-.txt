My-Life-feat-Ceekay-Jones-:Bliss N Eso
My life, my life. Yeah, yo, yo.

Pump this tape in the deck, place the key in ignition.
We won't wait in the red light, only green's in my vision.
Yeah, journey to the mind again, all aboard the brain.
These feathers make me levitate in waterfalls of pain.
Keep your fortune and your fame, mate, I'm chilling on a tree branch.
Laughing at the squares drawing perfect circles free-hand.
We kill the doubt, the path, the vine is limitless.
My rhyme is the reason that they can't define the pyramids.
Travel at the speed of light with Ceekay Jones,
with full faith of where this freeway goes.
A spectrum of colors, it's like our time
has come to ride high til we fly through that rising sun.

Baby, it's a new day,
driving on the through way,
all I see is bright green lights.
Forget what you would call me,
no that shit ain't for me,
I'ma just live my life.

My life, it's my life, it's my life.
I do what I want, I do what I want to do.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
I do what I want, I do what I want to do.

When I wake each day, it's like a new timeless moment.
The chance to steer you drive as soon as your eyelids open.
I push back the path that tipped the scales
and made it to the sea in time to catch my shipped had sailed.
Played the game my way, with my mind in the zone like Michael.
Recite my diary like I'm flying on a motorcycle.
The easy rider on that road that stretches nations,
life's speeding up and all I feel's acceleration with that wind in my face.
And I got that past in my back, and I got the prize in my eyes,
and I got my passion intact.
So I ride through the night and dream bright into the cosmos.
Now all I see is green lights at every crossroads.

Baby, it's a new day, driving on the through way,
all I see is bright green lights.
Forget what you would call me,
no that shit ain't for me,
I'ma just live my life.

My life, it's my life, it's my life.
I do what I want, I do what I want to do.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
I do what I want, I do what I want to do.

Baby, it's a new day.
My life, it's my life, life, life, life.
Baby, it's a new day.

Baby, it's a new day, driving on the through way,
all I see is bright green lights.
Forget what you would call me,
no that shit ain't for me,
I'ma just live my life.

My life, it's my life, it's my life.
I do what I want, I do what I want to do.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
My life, my life, my life, my life.
I do what I want, I do what I want to do.
