I-Wish-You-Would:Beelow
(feat. Thug Addict)
[Guys talking back and forth]
You ready to start this shit man
Man you fucking right
Man I'm bout to take this nigga head off his fucking shoulders,
Off the motherfucking top, you ready for this shit man
Man let's knock this nigga head off brah
Off the fucking top, look I got the SK's in the trunk,
I got the AK's in the back
We bout to handle this motherfucking shit right,

We bout to put it on his ass, what you want to do
Man let's do this shit nigga
Off the motherfucking top,

[Chorus: Thug Addict]
I wish u would, bitch I wish u would,
If you ever try to test my fucking nutts I wish u would
I wish u would, bitch I wish u would,
Ever try to test my nutts bitch I wish u would
[Verse 1: Beelow]
My mind keep telling me that these nigga wanna test
But they show no disrespect
Cause that's a automatic check
Cause nigga be quick to try to get yo ass on the slick
A there that's my boy rolling, for ya know you'll hear it click
But bitch who is this, you better know about Beelow
Cause my head a get to hurting,
I'm laying them bitches on the floor, for sure
Cause every hustler a be ya friend when you floss on top
On the outside looking in trying to take yo spot
But best believe that nine milli be my friend till the end
Trying to watch my enemies every corner I bend
Cause bitch made niggas on the side wish I tumble and fall
Player hate me to the fullest cause I shine when I ball
Nigga what, I don't give a what, slang it if you bring it
Talking shit to a thug, fucking slang it if you slang it
If you think you thought you think that you could take my shit
Bitch you know what's on my mind, I wish u would bitch,
Bitch I wish u would
[Chorus:]
I wish u would, bitch I wish u would,
Ever try to test my nutts bitch I wish u would
Boy I wish u would, bitch I wish u would,
Ever try to test me, boy I wish u would
[Verse 2: Beelow]
I wish u would talk shit and get shook

But stop before your words, cause looks can't hurt a damn thing
If you really want some funk, you'd came to the right man
Facing 2 murder charges and I'm stressing and shit
In a 24 man cell can't get home to my bitch
My last cigarette I smoked and now I nicking the shit
And a nigga holling nutt check bout to get his ass whipped
Me against the world, so I say fuck it, you got beef then bring it on
Saddle up you pussy bitch and catch a you ass in the restroom
We gone handle this like men cause ain't no guns in the place
Oh, before you leave that cell you gone have some knots on yo face
Let's recognize you bitch you
You don't know what I been through
Been locked up for 16 months and bout to take it out on you
Ole' lady ain't write back lawyer say it don't look good
And you wanna take my sues I wish u would
Bitch I wish u would, nigga
[Chorus:]
I wish u would, bitch I wish u would,
Ever try to test my nutts bitch I wish u would
Ol' punk ass, punk ass I wish u would,
Ever try to test my nutts, boy I wish u would
[Verse 3: Beelow]
Bang bang, cock cock, I'm a watch you scatter or drop
Retaliation is a must you cross me of the top
Can't give a fuck about a nigga out there making a name
Wanna bubble up you rep I say by putting salt in my game
I represent like a taz
Make a sweep on your block
Put that infra on your chest and knock yo ass out of yo socks
Over dosing on that doulja put my mind at easy
I got seventeen reasons to make yo bitch ass bleed
I'm still walking through that cemetery reading obituaries
Drop it like hot, and call me ghetto call me mercenary
Acting kind of scary when you looking down that barrel bitch
Fucked up moves, a get the rawest nigga dealt with
[Chorus:]
I wish u would, bitch I wish u would,
Ever try to test my nutts bitch I wish u would
I wish u would, bitch I wish u would
Ever try to test my nutts, boy I wish u would
I wish u would, nigga I wish u would
Ever try to test me, oh boy I wish u would
I wish u would ever try to test me
Ol punk ass, nigga I wish you would
