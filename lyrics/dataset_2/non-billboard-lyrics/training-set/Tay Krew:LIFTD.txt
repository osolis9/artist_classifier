She crys when she leaves me, just can't leave me alone
She tells me that she needs me, can't do this on her own
You can say shes addicted, my love keeps her liftd
So liftd (3x)
Shes lifted, she's liftd...yeah
(whoaoohwhoaoowhoa)

[Verse 1: TAY KREW]
Is it workin' yet
Tell me is it workin' yet
You wanna get high - hig...(2x)
I could be your Percocet
Waited 90 days
Cause she know that it is worth respect
Never do you wrong (do you wrong)
Girl I come correct
Then she say "Oh yeah?"
Uhh
Tell me how you're never gonna leave..
How I'm always gonna be that one in your heart
Gotta make me believe
Then I'm like "Okay, girl I never would lie..."
Other women try to get it but I'm never gonna try
Really not that sly, but you not that shy
She addicted say a nigga get her so high
So what its like
Being sober I assume you have forgotten
From the pleasure you have gotten
Treatin my dick like OxyContin
And I'm like "Okay" when my light gone fade
But she love to get it in whether its night or day
Really like that Yay, what you really wanna say
Withdraw with out a nigga so I really gotta stay
And my
Niggas think she bad
Hooked on a nigga, she need rehab
Uhh
Go so hard, try to do it all
And I tell her "You don't need that"
But that's why I got faith that one day she gonna listen
But for now, I can manage being her only addiction

Too good to be true
Right
Life's too real
Love it when I hit it all night, you feel
Like the type I'd wife, when it's right I'll kneel
But until that time sit back and chill
Shootin' it up, all in your vein
Love feeling numb, but you're hidin' your pain
Giving it all when there's little to gain
Searching for love while you cry in the rain
You can lean on me when you can't stand
Girl you know I'mma play my part
The only one there when it ends
Cause I've been there from the very start
Saved me from myself, you had seen what I had become
I thought a night with all those woman
Was worth me never loving one
But that's over now and its just us
We don't talk about the past that's hush hush
And I know its hard but you must trust
That I'd
Rather take it slow, don't rush lust
You've been so mad at me lately
Need your fix your getting shaky
Its my job to keep you high
In small doses for your safety
And its true
Ya its true
Rather come second then not at all
She know music comes first
Then she get mad when I don't call
But now we back
Over there again
Say my love like heroin
She cherish every moment
And just pray that it never ends
