Summertime:DJ Jazzy Jeff
Drums please

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Here it is, the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be

A little bit outta control, it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes
That moves romance?
Give me a soft subtle mix
An' if ain't broke, then don't try to fix it

An' think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base an' let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD an' let me run a rhyme
An' put your car on cruise an' lay back
'Cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

School is out an' it's a sort of a buzz
An' back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness

The weather is hot an' girls are dressin' less
An' checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Ridin' around in your jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan, sittin' on Lorenzos

Back in Philly, we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody go
Guys out huntin' an' girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes

She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
An' with a pen an' pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you an' get you equipped for the summer time

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day an' I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah, I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
'Cause basketball courts, in the summer, got girls there

The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib, change your clothes once more
'Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4

Sittin' with your friends 'cause y'all reminisce
About the days, growin' up an' the first person you kiss
An' as I think back, makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia

All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playin' double dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune
As the old folks dance at your family reunion

Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise, so you head to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show

Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' an' maxin'
Chillin', in the car they spent all day waxin'

Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition
Of summer madness

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind
