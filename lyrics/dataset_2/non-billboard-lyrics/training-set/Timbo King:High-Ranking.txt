High-Ranking:Timbo King
(feat. R.A. the Rugged Man)

[Verse 1: Timbo King]
You that type of rapper that’ll wear his doo rag tight
And if the shoe fits wear it homie, sky blue Nikes
I beat the dude out you, then have my crew stomp the food out you
Heart transplant, with my hands take immunes out you
Laughin’ at your garbage ass and throw you in a garbage can
I break your mic, fist fight, this God-body Israelite
You know your lessons 1 through 40, still in the 40-40
Poppa Wu, pride and glory, got the hood riding for me
GMC, TMZ, I don’t know if it’s he or she
Movin’ like a transvest, it must be in your ancest’
Assets, liquidate, math-head, this is weight
Blood type, I know your trait, snitching, First 48
Got you on confession tape, affidavit, got it dated
Lame loser, name user, love get the pain bruiser
Spray ‘em with the brain remover, dog food, Eukanuba
Larry Hoover, Cooper shooter, stash it with the building super

[Hook: Timbo King]
Yo Your mother got a rubber neck, your pops lost his social check
Snack jokes, cock-um-roach, bitch nigga rocking coach
High ranking bumbaclot Ras ho, who’s ya fakin
Uncle is your father’s daughter, toilet bowl is out of water
High ranking

[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]
Your daddy crack-pipe smoking, your wifey elbows are ashy, they need lotion
Your baby-momma sniffing coke and you fucking AIDS bitches with a broken Trojan
You zone-coasting, you a lightweight, you weigh about a buck-10
With your clothes on soaking, eating pretzels with Bush choking
These bullshit rap groups, they cornier than black comedians
Dressing like females, doing movies in fat suits
Your aunt bigfoot, goonie goo goo, falling down a flight of stairs
You got the dragon, your breath give the cavity creeps nightmares
In prison you a rape victim, Al Jolson “Heaven On A Mule,” mammy singing
Front teeth missing, get stomped out and your brain kicked in
I’m nitroglycerin you pig-licking, and stinking like chitlin
You a new jack, you the baby that Biggie Smalls was smackin’ at the christenin’
Your bitch grill look like she got karate-chopped by Sonny Chiba
Your momma so fat and old she use a VCR for a beeper
Your grandmamma penny-pinchin’ hagglin’
Your granddaddy backwards alligator wrastlin’
Your glasses nerdier than Roger from What’s Happening?
Your demeanor make RuPaul look masculine
I’m in Europe, you’re at the corner store, that’s your idea of travelin’
Put you in the corner with a dunce cap
Your breath stankin’, cut you with a shank an’ you sank and your kids are starving
You broke, ain’t got no money in the bank, and Timbo tell ‘em we high ranking

[Verse 3: Timbo King]
You that rapper in that boolay movie, playing with his booty cootie
Ducking from the jury duty, niggas call you foofie foofie
Breath smell like twilight zone, do do DO DO do do DO DO
Shit face, out-of-shape, pop eyes, wide awake
Midget hands, chicken fingers, linger with them dingy niggas
Background singer-speakers, run-down Louie sneakers
Ankle boy, tinker bell, sister steal Jheri curl
Dill pickle, bi-cycle, ring-worn in your perm
Sherm head, missing tooth, no-frill gizzard soup
Full breed, knock kneed, house smell like Aki
