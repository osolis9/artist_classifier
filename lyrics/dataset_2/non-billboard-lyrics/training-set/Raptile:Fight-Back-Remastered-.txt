Tongue run vividly,

Be quiet,

Any time, any place, any where, any how,
Monstablokaz, we all solders,
Never give up we all focused,

Rock a ski mask,
Keep hip-hop open,

We fight like a soldier,
Ya know we take over,
We fight like I told ya

Hook

If shit's too hard,
You're too soft,
Trust fkers I ain't fallin off,
I've been in it a minute,
at Rap wars I'm winnin,
at Rap bars I'm killin them,
Act hard on the internet,
That's all,
I'm grinnin and finish them last thoughts,
I won't lose,
And I'll never back off,
No,
We pitbullin' in ya club,
Always stay busy like bullets in the hood,
Peace then it's peace,
Beef than it's beef,
Halfhearted rappers,
Stop beefin with me,
Actin like they wanna meet in the streets,
I ain't buyin it,
like Bushido CD's
I know you love my style,
Fk you I hate your style



Hook

Bridge

Lioness fight back,
Cronite fight back,
Polique fight back,

Still nice flows,
Still maestro,

Everybody watchin listenin and y'all,

Say it loud Monstablokaz,
Say it loud Monstablokaz,
I know you love my style...
