Splackavellie-radio-mix-:Pressha
You know there comes a period in every womans life
When she gets frustrated or fed up with her man
And all his silly hangups, you know a woman needs a man
That doesn't come with any drama behind it you know
Someone that could just love her down with no strings attached
And his name is Splackavellie

Tell me what kind of superman
Would take you in his bedroom, baby?
And hit you with some front back and side to side
Like hydrolics on a stormy night
And break you off sumthin' proper like

Ain't no need for you to perpertrate
'Cause he will accomadate
And you will aprecciate tha way he flips you up
Down and round and round in and out and make you scream and shout
Shortie put your thang down down down

He ain't ya boyfriend, he ain't ya husband
Just sumbody you can call when your body needs a fix
He'll put you in tha mix, den you'll hear him askin'
"What's my name? Say my name"
Splackavellie

Every woman needs her own Splackavellie
A brotha she can call when her man ain't doin' her right
He can work it all night until tha morning light
Make her feel right right right

Every woman needs that one Splackavellie
A brotha she can call when her man ain't doin' her right

Tell me what kind of superman
Would make you feel good with his mouth?
And kiss you from your earring to your bellychain
Then go down a little further mayn
It's all right, baby, ain't no shame

Drop tha top on his Mercedes Benz
So her legs can feel tha wind
As he hits again and again and again
It's all good yeah, because I'm 'bout it, 'bout it baby
I'm 'bout it, 'bout it baby

He ain't ya boyfriend, he ain't ya husband
Just sumbody you can call when your body needs a fix
He'll put you in tha mix, den you'll hear him askin'
"What's my name? Spell my name"
