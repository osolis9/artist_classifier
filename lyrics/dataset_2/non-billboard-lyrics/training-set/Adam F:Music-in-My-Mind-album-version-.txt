Music-in-My-Mind-album-version-:Adam F
There is a place
Where you can hide away
And let the music in your mind
Just take control
There is a place where
You can fly away
And let the music in your mind
Just start to flow

Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow

Feel the music in my mind
I hear you calling
Music in my mind
I hear you calling me
Feel the music in my mind
I hear you calling me
Music in my mind
For the music in my mind

There is a place
Where you can hide away
And let the music in your mind
Just take control
There is a place where
You can fly away
And let the music in your mind
Just start to flow

Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow

Feel the music in my mind
I hear you calling
Music in my mind
I hear you calling me
Feel the music in my mind
I hear you calling me
Music in my mind
For the music in my mind

Gonna make ya freak within this vibe
Gonna make the music come alive
Gonna make ya dream of paradise
In control to freak you baby
Gonna make ya groove within this vibe
Gonna make the music come alive
Gonna make ya dream of paradise
Drum and bass to freak you baby

(Trumpet solo)

Break it down
But don't stop rockin'
This is a jam
Cool jam
My jam
F jam
