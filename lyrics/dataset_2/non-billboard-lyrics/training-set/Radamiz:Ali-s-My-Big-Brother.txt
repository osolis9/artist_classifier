Ali-s-My-Big-Brother:Radamiz
These audibles got me feeling like the oracle
New York to the bone but the skeleton's so portable
I'm here now cause ya'll been asking the heavens
The mean flow that gets madder in a matter of seconds
Man, I'm fly like YKK
Gentrification on my street, modern KKK
My grandmama's close to dying, I can't save her day
Can a sixteen save her life or should I make my peace? I feel disgraced
I'm just tryna marry music but she's got me in the friend zone
Pulling out my hair like "where the fuck did all my ends go?"
Chase bigger Chase receipts, don't worry where my friends go
The real ones understand I put it all into this tempo
Welcome Home mats in the house of sin
But Ali's My Big Brother and 2Pac's his twin
All my Fam Royalty, a Childish bar?
I fine 'em for a show and help them find their hearts

I feel like Ali
All my life I've been ready for the war, all my life I've been ready for the war
I feel like Ali
All my life I've been ready for the war, all my life I've been ready for the war
Goddammit I feel like Ali
All my life I've been ready for the war, all my life I've been ready for the war
I feel like Ali
Ali's My Big Brother, feel like 2Pac's my Big Brother

First G.O.O.D. Music then good business
That's Big Sean to Carlos Slim, that good fitness
Drunk off life so I don't ask for forgiveness
I invest in my career and hope you pay me back with interest
This song got my dick feeling 33 inches long
The sensai, censor your lip man
We runnin' the building motherfucker and your rents late, comprende?
I love myself so you're scared of this
"Ill" is my inheritance, is pussy still your therapist?
I'm teaching you confidence, tell me if you're hearin' it
Fuck modest, you can't see the shark in their appearances?
Dog eat Dog world, homie ain't learn it sooner
All we got is our balls and our word, he looking neutered
The 1%, show respect when my mic's plugged
New York Don't Love Me but I bet that your wife does

I feel like Ali
All my life I've been ready for the war, all my life I've been ready for the war
I feel like Ali
All my life I've been ready for the war, all my life I've been ready for the war
Goddammit I feel like Ali
All my life I've been ready for the war, all my life I've been ready for the war
I feel like Ali
Ali's My Big Brother, feel like 2Pac's my Big Brother
