Am-more-than:RJ
Am more than
[Verse 1]
How do I say them....oh.,.
Am feelin overwhelmed....so....
Help me a way 
I have to say
Certain things important!
Many times it is....as
A spot in which I ....was
Confused to go which way!
Am hoping oh...one day

[Prechorus]
I would make them pay
Indirect even okay...
But I'll make a situation
To make a perception

[Chorus]
See am more than
What u thought am
Now what do u say,
A fool who's to be slayed?
No....no
Am more than that
Again!!!!
[Verse 2]
Am in no
Deception!
I don't believe
In correction!
Is there any mistakes?
For which am held at stakes?
Yeah...yeah
Tell me what are those
U say am like
Quills at rose!!!!!
Do you mean
To say that am
Being imperfect for ya?????

[Prechorus]
I would make them pay
Indirect even okay...
But I'll make a situation
To make a perception

[Chorus]
See am more than
What u thought am
Now what do u say,
A fool who's to be slayed?
No....no
Am more than that
Again!!!!

[Verse 3]
Hey...
Why all feel
So still?
Like a theif
Caught in film?
Am like a bird
In the nest
Fearing to do a fly!
I think I'd fall
So how can begin I?
No...no....
Its all different!!!!
Right,

[Prechorus]
I would make them pay
Indirect even okay...
But I'll make a situation
To make a perception

[Chorus]
See am more than
What u thought am
Now what do u say,
A fool who's to be slayed?
No....no
Am more than that
Again!!!!
