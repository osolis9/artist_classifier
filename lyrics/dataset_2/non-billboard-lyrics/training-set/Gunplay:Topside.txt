Pussy fallin’ from the sky – tip that bitch
Every day and every night – tip that bitch
Pussy fallin’ from the sky – tip that bitch
Every day and every night – tip that bitch
Pussy fallin’ from the sky – tip that bitch
Every day and every night – tip that bitch
She poppin’ pussy for that dime
Now tip that bitch, quit actin’ blind

[Verse 1]
Picture big bottoms on that topside
Big dollars on that topside
That bitch bad, she a problem on that topside
Lookin’ like madonna on that topside (holla)
She entertain me on that topside
Ass lookin’ wavy on that topside
Aye – she get down on that topside
I’ll make it rain, I’ll make her drown on that topside
I’d like to see you on that topside
So I throw a G up on that topside
Aye – might just throw a key up on that topside
Dope boys throwin’ fee up on that topside

[Verse 2]
Pussy from the sky, dope boys let that money fly
I got my check, I flip my money on the topside
Remix on the bottle, A-1 on the topside
Bottles on the rider, broke niggas on the left side
Got bad bitches everywhere, menages in the club
Put a pole in my garage and turned it to a club
Bad bitches only, all my hoes flexed up
Keep my niggas with me, hoes I don’t trust none
I bought my own club and called it Topside
Five levels, $5000 for the topside
You leave out it, cost a stack to come back inside
And these hoes wanna die out for that topside

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You tipped ‘em now you’re dippin’
Make them dollars go the distance
She be trippin’, she the real one
Suck that dick right out your Dickies
We topside in this hoe
Fuck that stop sign, we on “go”
All this champagne, a little lap dance
A couple hundred ones for that pole
That ass fake, but it feel real
When that ass shake, I love it
Got racks on you, big timing
Now show some love to that pussy
Pussy… good pussy make a nigga odd
Pussy… make it rain just like a shower, pop
All this pussy fallin’ from the sky
Bitch, I’m tryna catch a couple now
Bitch I’m ballin’ ’til I fuckin’ die
I’m talkin’ every day and every night
