Ball-Everywhere-I-Go:Chingo Bling
I ball everywhere I go
(Where I go)
I got a Benz
I don't crawl on them '84's
('84)

The ladies love us
'Cause our song on the radio
(Radio)
We fin' to take 'em to the
Tele, make a video

A video, I said
I ball everywhere I go
(Where I go)
I got a Benz
I don't crawl on them '84's
('84)

The ladies love us
Cause our song on the radio
(Radio)
We fin' to take 'em to the
Tele, make a video, avideo

Mercedes Benz, lot of bragger
Done more shows than Mick Jagger
Gots a Visa on a cracker
Underground, track jacker

Rock ostrich, rock gators
Custom boots, now and later
Black on black like Darth Vader

Prada lens 'sache shader
Hit the pen, hit the pencil
Down around the buildin' when I do it in still
Hey, little kid, no touch my Benzo
Paris Hilton went in my limo

Ay, you don't know, she my baby boo
Down south, we bangin' Screw
Ball fades and braids, too
Where Dem Dollars At, like Gangsta Boo

In Miami, havin' lunch
Sign a deal with such and such
Puff Daddy ain't have enough
Chingo Bling gon' platinum plants

Just like the teeth is in my mouth
Thirty stacks on the couch
Hundred grand, pulled it out
Take the rubber band off, threw it in the crowd

I ball everywhere I go
(Where I go)
I got a Benz
I don't crawl on them '84's
('84)

Jeezy got 'em for seventeen
Ross got 'em for twenty-two
They both got 'em from you know who
They keep that off MTV News

Break bread with a Mexican
Price low, I ain't taxin'
Think I had sex with Janet Jackson
Take a look at me, who you askin'

Lose a magmun, I ain't trust 'em
Hidden camera on manosa
Meet Demi Moore on 24
I took that whore from Ashton Cutcher

And she pulled over when I tap my foot
Look at me, I have a hood
When I'm done, she'll ride the book
Call me young, man, not a crook

Don't I smell like a bag of money?
Mama ain't raised no damn dummy
Smile fade with a fat tummy
Big ol' lobsters, that's from Lucky

Got more cheese than a quesadilla
Texas boy, your oil driller
Fuck swag, I Sas'parilla
Chingo boots, armadillo

I ball everywhere I go
(Where I go)
I got a Benz
I don't crawl on them '84's
('84)

Me and Chingo Bling, we down in Florida
Got three models on a camcorder
Vida Guerra, my bench warmer
Got it in the backseat of that red Ferrari

Mayne
Look at the wheels
And now I know how a baby feels
Seen Babyface when he got the deal
Man, I got that whip appeal

Candy Rain, I'm Soul IV Real
Kurt Cobain, all the mobile
I drive for change, blew out the brain
It's drippin' red off the bumper grill

Already
Yeah, that's trill
Like you did that there, now put this here
Bought Cleto a diamond grill
Same day that I got my deal

Brown party, I ain't white
Like Mike Jones, I'm a say it twice
Got more hoes than Brian McKnight
Got more hoes than Brian McKnight

Next door neighbor, Chevy Chase
Got these rocks from out of state
Signed to you, no mama's, wey
C.E.O., all I gotta say

I ball everywhere I go
(Where I go)
I got a Benz
I don't crawl on them '84's
('84)
