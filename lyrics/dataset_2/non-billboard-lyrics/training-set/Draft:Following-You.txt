Following-You:Draft
run away with me to a better place
to a place where our memories have no meaning
I want to be near you hear you feel you breathing on my skin
fall asleep as we enter a portal to our dreams
run away with me to a different scene
to a scene where we can imagine and control
I want to be near you I want to hear you feel you breathing on my skin
fall asleep as we enter the portal to our dreams
count the stars as we watch from the sky
watch your life unfold inside my mind don't look away
my heart beats quicker this portals deeper
but I can't look away
run away with me through this better dream it's spiraling down Ive lost control
I want to be near you I want to hear you feel you breathing on my skin
fall asleep as we enter the portal to our dreams
I'm calling out for you
my thoughts are clouded my doors are closing up
I'm stuck in a world I know know nothing of I've been misguided I need you to wake me up
but I can't look away
I'm calling out for you
my thoughts are clouded my doors are closing up
I'm stuck in a world I now no nothing of
I've been misguided
that's why I got to be near you I've got to hear you feel you breathing on my skin
fall asleep as we enter the portal to our dreams
the portal to our dreams 3X
watch from Stars don't look away this portals deeper
