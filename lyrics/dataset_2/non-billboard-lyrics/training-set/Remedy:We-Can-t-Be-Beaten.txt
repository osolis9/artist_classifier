We Can't Be Beaten
(Anderson/Riley)
If ya wanna be in my gang, stand up with me
We'll start a revolution and make the streets free
We'll never weaken, we'll give it our best
Can't be defeated, we're better than the rest

Shoulder to shoulder, we're gonna stand
We're gonna fight to the very last man
Can't be defeated, don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder, we'll fight the world

We can't be beaten, what'll we tell 'em boys
We can't be beaten

There comes a time, when every man must fight
When he believes in justice and right
He'll take so much till he'll take no more
They'll hear us coming when they hear the mighty roar

Shoulder to shoulder, we're gonna stand
We're gonna fight to the very last man
Can't be defeated, don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder, we'll fight the world

We can't be beaten, Let me hear ya
We can't be beaten, Sing it out loud
We can't be beaten, We'll tell the world
We can't be beaten

Now listen, everybody out there that really cares
You gotta realize that you're the real power
We can rule the streets
It's just up to you and me

Can't be defeated, don't know the word
Shoulder to shoulder, we'll fight the world

'Cause
We can't be beaten, hey hey
We can't be beaten, you gotta believe it
We can't be beaten, they'll soon find out
We can't be beaten, no
We can't be beaten
We can't be beaten, when they hear our voice
We can't be beaten, they'll hear us comin'
We can't be beaten, we've got the cause to fight
