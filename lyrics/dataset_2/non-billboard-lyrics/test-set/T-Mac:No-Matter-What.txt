No-Matter-What:T-Mac
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aye
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I say still I stand, aye
And shawty here I am

Neva have ya seen in ya lifetime
A more divine southern rapper
Wit a swag like mine
Facin all kind of time
But smile like Im fine
Brag with such passion
And shine without trying

Believe me, pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime
Out tha gutta I climbed
Spoke my mind
And didnt stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest
Gotta suffer some time

So I huff and puff rhymes
Lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standard in Atlanta
How to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers
Wanna dis just kill it
I'm officially the realest
Point blank period

Whether I still live in the hood or juss visit
Whateva you can do in the hood I done did it
Thats why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still his city as long as Tip living nigga

I aint dead
(Naw)
I aint done
(Naw)
I aint scared
(Of what?)
I aint run
(From who?)

But still I stand
(Yeah)
No matter what people
Here I am
(Yeah)
No matter what, remember

I aint break
(Neva)
I aint fold
(Neva)
They hate me mo
(So!)
Yeah I know
(Haha)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aye
