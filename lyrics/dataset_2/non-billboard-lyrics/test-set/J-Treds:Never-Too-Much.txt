Never-Too-Much:J-Treds
[J-Treds]
Uh-huh~! Yo yo, never too much
Producer Shawn J. Period
J-Treds type experience
Check it out
Say what, say what, say what?
Yo, say what, say what, SAY what
Knahmsayin? Check them out
Never too much

I'm the only emcee well spoken, top of the line
Only reason cats knock mine's cause the bell's broken
And I can tell when they're open, yellin the name
of this well-trained professional, but I don't sell tokens
Cause I spell in Hell for, heads who fell short
Tryin to see J but got schooled and well taught
By the Professor, slash mae-stro
Heads learn from excerpts of, my fresh flow
that my rap skills are nuts (what?) Truly that is
I be gettin heads so open, cats spill they guts
Cause when they start to listen to my lyrics and try to diss 'em
Even in battles peepin the spirit of competition
Brothers show love, to the flow of (J) soon to blow up
But for now, the nice kid, only a few know of
Anonymous, but if I choose so, I can
show and prove I'm the man, most at hand trust

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Cause I let loose and bust, super deluxe
Because I'm J-Treds and I'm never too much
Heads be like "Yo J, whatever you touch
Son it's never too much, never too much, never too much"

[J-Treds]
A lot of cats they won't test, they not gonna pass
I'm the top of the class, honor roll fresh
That's why I don't stress unless heads are frontin
Then Treds will son 'em, cause +Father Knows Best+
I drop family jewels kid, don't be mad at me
Cause I can light it up, with no batteries included
Guaranteed to play, cause J's got skills, to pay the bills
Most emcees, need a raise
They insufficient, that's why, they fall short
Thinkin, they can match mine - wrong thought
Better wise up, open they eyes up, or get slapped up
and broke down, to the self-image, I suck
Cause I'm that nice, in other words, pass the mic
So that I can let 'em know and show cats the light
Leave 'em blinded, snatch they rhyme hook, redesign it
And leave 'em with some big words that nothin rhymes with

[Chorus]

[J-Treds]
Aiyyo I'm lovin it, superb, like few ever heard
Lacin the world but a safe approximate is two-thirds
Cause the listening public know, J-Treds flow
with some of the most flavor, taste tests show
3 to 1, he's the man, fuck the leading brand
I'm spittin it butter creamy, not Jif or Peter Pan
I got what you need - wait for the rest to lose faith
That's why, when I rhyme, choosy heads choose J
It's one of the most raw, hear to show all
Whack rappers, they can play the side like coleslaw
I'm the entree, droppin it, bombs away~!
With the taste that leaves you laced like, lingerie
So delicious, my skillet be, mouth-watering
Plus my delivery, makes people wanna order in
And I bring it dumb nice, from the pros, to the ams
Leave 'em stranded (in no man's land) like a lesbian lover

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yo never too much
Y'know y'know, cause I let loose and bust
Yo, yo, what you do? Let loose and bust
Yo, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yo, cause that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh
That's, that's the way, cause I let loose and bust
Yo, super super super, super duper
Cause I let loose ... uh-huh, uh-huh
Cause I let let la-let let loose
Shawn J, yo, let loose and bust
I let loose and bust, yo
Cause I'm never too much
