Screwin-It-Up:One Block Radius
I try to be good
I really do try to be good
Oh yeah

I woke up in the front yard
Where did my pants go?
Smoked my last little bit of weed
Somebody busted out my window

But I just thank God
He forgive my sins
'Cause I'm 110 percent sure
It's gonna happen again

I work so hard to make something of my life
But I still feel lost inside my heart sometimes

But I get through
Oh, oh yeah
I get through
Oh, oh yeah

But I get through
 (I'm either screwin' it up or doin' it up)
Oh, oh yeah
 (Screwin' it up or doin' it up)

I get through
 (I'm either screwin' it up or doin' it up)
Oh, oh yeah
 (Screwin' it up or doin' it up)

They call me crazy
But they don't know the half of it
Call me daily
I just can't seem to get past the shit

I stumbled in the front door
Tripped on the suitcase
(Said she's leavin' tonight)
Yeah, she said ticket's going one way

But I can't bicker
Or say I'll change my ways
'Cause I'm more than a 10 percent sure
It's gonna end up the same

I work so hard to make something of my life
But I still feel lost inside my heart sometimes

But I get through
Oh, oh yeah
I get through
 (Try to be good)
Oh, oh yeah

But I get through
 (I'm either screwin' it up or doin' it up)
Oh, oh yeah
 (Screwin' it up or doin' it up)

I get through
 (I'm either screwin' it up or doin' it up)
Oh, oh yeah
 (Screwin' it up or doin' it up)
Just like you

I need to get to work
But I'd rather celebrate and get on curb
(Just like you)
I would love to stay with you, girl
But I always got my eyes on a new girl
(Just like you)

I wanna throw some ones at a stripper
But I ain't got no funds to give her
(Just like you)
I ridin' on a train
I'm about to get some dope to ease the pain

But I get through
Oh, oh yeah
I get through
Oh, oh yeah

But I get through
 (I'm either screwin' it up or doin' it up)
Oh, oh yeah
 (Screwin' it up or doin' it up)

I get through
 (I'm either screwin' it up or doin' it up)
Oh, oh yeah
 (Screwin' it up or doin' it up)

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
