Shine-Waiting-for-Superman-version-:John Legend
They wait to plead their case
Unknown, cast aside
I love to see their face
Can we spare the light?
Are we afraid to see
The prisoners of history?
These beautiful minds, trapped inside
Bring them back to life
Let them shine
Let them shine on
Let them shine
Let them shine on
So dark, but I see sparks
If we don't snuff them out
We gotta let them flame, let them speak their name
Let them reach up to the clouds
Can't eat if we don't feed them
Can't read if we don't teach them
There's no line if we just hide them
Don't just let them die
Let them shine
Let them shine on
Let them shine
Let them shine on
Let them shine on
Let them shine on
Let them shine on
Let them shine on
Lonely out in space
They sing out when we're not listening
'Cause we don't see their face
We can let them die, we can make them high
Hold the little miracles that live inside
Let them shine
Let them shine
Let them shine on
Let them live
Let them shine on
Let them read on
Let them shine on
Let them grow
Let them shine on
Come on, let them love
Come on, let them love
Come on, let them love
Hold them close, let them know
They'll get through the night
Ordinary people could be a hero
Don't blow out the light
Let them shine
Let them shine on
Let them shine
Let them shine on
Let them shine on
