Last-Time:Brisky
[Chorus:]
 What if I told you that I fell in love with you
 Last time we kissed
 I fell in love the last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 Everything went blind
 When your lips touched mine (hey)
 Don't know what it was about that time
 (I fell in love)
 I swear girl I ain't lying when I say
 I fell in love that last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 (I fell in love)

[Verse 1:]
 (Yea) under stars, we met lips and something sparked
 Sent me kisses from the heart
 Put here for me from my God
 It's like your lips were made for mine
 And baby mine were made for you
 It's like your kisses make me high
 It's like we make out on the moon
 What if I told you I fell in love last time my lips hit yours
 What if I told you I felt these feelings and I just can't ignore it
 What if I told you to marry me would you tell me I do
 Would you think I'm just playing with you
 Or would you understand what I'm saying is true?
 Pure magic baby
 The feeling you gave me, magic baby
 Fell for you tragic
 Kiss me with lips soft as satin
 Felt your tongue, felt your love, fell in love, shit I almost fell out
 No lie now you the only one my heart can think about

[Chorus:]
 What if I told you that I fell in love with you
 Last time we kissed
 I fell in love the last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 Everything went blind
 When your lips touched mine (hey)
 Don't know what it was about that time
 (I fell in love)
 I swear girl I ain't lying when I say
 I fell in love that last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 (I fell in love)

 (Hey)
 Let the beat ride
 (Hey)

[Verse 2:]
 (Uh) All the past times that we kissed
 Ain't got shit on last time we kissed
 Cause shit, last time we kissed, like it'd be the last time that we'd kiss
 It's like time didn't exist
 It froze with you on my mind,
 Baby I swear everything went bling
 By time our tongues intertwined
 What if I told you I'd hold you down
 And help lift you up
 Baby you should understand by now
 I wanna give you all my love
 Blocked out the entire earth
 Together we felt the fireworks
 My love, your lips inspired it
 The love I felt last time we kissed

[Chorus:]
 What if I told you that I fell in love with you
 Last time we kissed
 I fell in love the last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 Everything went blind
 When your lips touched mine (hey)
 Don't know what it was about that time
 (I fell in love)
 I swear girl I ain't lying when I say
 I fell in love that last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 (I fell in love)

[Bridge:]
 What if I told you that I fell in love with you
 Last time we kissed (last time we kissed)
 Everything went blind
 When your lips touched mine (hey)
 Don't know what it was about that time
 I swear girl I ain't lying when I say
 Last time we kissed
 (I fell in love)

[Chorus:]
 What if I told you that I fell in love with you
 Last time we kissed
 I fell in love the last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 Everything went blind
 When your lips touched mine (hey)
 Don't know what it was about that time
 (I fell in love)
 I swear girl I ain't lying when I say
 I fell in love that last time we kissed
 Don't know what you did to me girl
 (I fell in love)
