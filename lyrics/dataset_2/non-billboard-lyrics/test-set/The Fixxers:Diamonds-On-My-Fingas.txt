Diamonds-On-My-Fingas:The Fixxers
I can be alittle picky, blame the sticky icky
Pick a bottle get a glass down to sippy sippy
I see you baby keep bouncing on your tipy toes
When the beat drop dip and make your booty roll
Cold peace of work filling out your miny skirt
It's saturday night you'll prolly wear that shit to church
Sick of lame dudes frontin wit an attitude
Talkin bout they rims and all the damn tennis shoes
I got some grown man game for your blue tooth
I'm hot middle of winter coup no roof
Used to shusi beno and some calamari
Your want a nigga that might grow up to be somebody
OG resorts by the sea sand between toes
Umbrella in ya drinks
Worldwide AM hit me on the G mail
I brought my boy wit me so bring another female

Diamonds on my fingers a couple on my toes
Walked up to the party seen so many hoes
Can You work wit that, Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that.(female voice) I can work wit that
Cali to the A we speeding down the freeway
In the stretch LS baby we hood fellas
Can You work wit that, Can You work wit that
Can You work wit that.(female voice) I can work wit that

Let me do my job girl don't make it easy for me
Tomorrow morning make my eggs wit onions chessy for me
Come get the keys to the suite up at the shopie tell
Room 204??? and ima meet you there
Take a bubble bath get the robe out the closet
And wait for me don't think I'm afraid to toss it
You hate for me to stand up cause it makes you nauseous
It's late but can't go to sleep cause ur pussy gorgeous
It's quik baby I didn't drop the dj
You might find me GA showin off my LA
So many apple bottom freaks showin pellie
I might give um my celly take um to the telly
She in the doubletree suites wit her hands on hips
A look in her eyes smile on her lips
It's that soothern hospitality thats my reality
Hit the waffle house and finish wit some alize
