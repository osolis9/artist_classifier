Ruthless-For-Life:MC Ren:13:1998-08-22

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass
Villain make it or continue it, look at all the shit you in
Eazy does it that be like the shit we used to do
Five niggaz comin' out the C P T so fuck you

Time changed for the good niggaz in the hood be comin' up
Villain can you set it off again, you know you should
Yo let's that this shit back to 1989
Where this nigga shit I'm bustin niggaz know they couldn't find

Dream Team members Egyptian fan base
Villain hit the scene, all them fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same

Opened up doors for you niggaz that be thinkin'
That your flows be on tizight, bitin' what I wrizite
Chokin' when I recite killin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

Real mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch but you know this shit is tight
'Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you 'cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me

Or the other three, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shook the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now it's chrome city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack

Ruthless attack all the way to two though
Try to block it out but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothafucka's grin

I hear they bitches sayin' that's MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I bought a King Tex's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
Y'all can kiss my black ass one more time

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villian want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed we find 'em, fuck 'em, then we flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that bitch, she want me

Niggaz we crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all crystal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit, still didn't hit

What it take for y'all quit ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we go, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock

Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
When this shit drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Villain gives a fuck? 'Cause this is ruthless for life

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life

The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause its do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why 'cause I'm ruthless for life
