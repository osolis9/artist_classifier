In a Cadillac truck 24's with 10's

Looking at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flying in at nine

New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly

And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a ol' school Caddy with a "Diamond in the back"
