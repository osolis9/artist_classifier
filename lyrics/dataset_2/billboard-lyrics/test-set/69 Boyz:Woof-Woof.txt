Woof Woof
Better ride 
You in tune to the sounds 
Of the dance floor giants, 69 
And we come to make you dance 
And I brought my dogs wit' me 
Check it out 
Hold up, wait a minute 
Y'all dance, who think I'm pretty? 
Loud man breakin' your sound 
We're the force to make ya get down 
Know and a bigger mess in your plans 
It beats nuthin' so I dance 
69 mic on the ground, breakin' it down 
Wantin' more time 
But this time, it's for my dogs 
South, North, all y'all 
There's more little things in life to get waaaaaa 
What about the one's in your waaaaa 
Those that don't like it huh? 
Cuz me and my dogs are rightin' to get cool in it 
Then I cut and chit chat, y'all where ya at? Where ya at? 
Chorus: 
Woof Woof 
Where ya at? 
Woof Woof 
Where ya at? 
Woof Woof 
Where ya at? Where ya at? Where ya at? 
Repeat 3x 
This is for the dogs in the lounge 
And all the dogs in the grill 
Can't be forgettin' the dogs in our town 
That be keepin' it real 
And all the dogs that we've known 
They bark is worse than they bite 
This for the dogs that get hiiiiiiii 
Here's one that I love 
Say, yo, ladies? (Yeah?) 
Whassup? I know y'all 'bout to get ??? 
Light the 3 6 and tear da club up 
If ya wit me dance a lil' bit 
I know y'all lad' came to chill 
Specially if y'all up on the bill 
From the old up from A town 
Cuz y'all like it cheaper right now 
AKA as I get on my roll 
Work that body down to the floor 
Y'all just ain't afraid to vibrate 
Shake it up 'till it breaks 
And if ya get bump come see the father 
Little girl, you know that I gotcha 
And I want ya, like that 
But for right now, where ya at? Where ya at? 
Chrous 4x 
This is for my dogs in ??? 
And all my dogs in LA 
Can't forget my dogs in New Orleans 
Let's ride and ride it all day 
Hands down, shake up, we all up in the mix 
And it's about time we all break it down 
And it goes a little sumthin' like this 
Yo, dog, you see a little sumthin' you like? 
You say, here kittie kittie, here kittie kittie kittie 
And she lookin' all good in the club tonight 
You say, here kittie kittie, here kittie kittie kittie 
If you's a dog and you need a fix 
Here kittie kittie, here kittie kittie kittie 
So jump to the music 
Here kittie kittie, here kittie kittie kittie 
We've been tryin to tell y'all for years 
That you need to open your ears 
Take a trip down to the dirty south 
And fine out what is woof woof about 
It's just a word we get call 
No time for hype beats and huh

Wit the way that I bump bump bump 
Ladies down from state to state 
Cuz like ya'll dogs, we operate 
And see when the bass of his glip 
Well, ya must be in tune to hear what we hear 
Just like ya ought to do 
But inside of you 
If not, we didn't come through 
Knowin' the South is all of that 
But for now I wanna know where that dogs is at 
Chorus 4x 
This for the dogs in Virginia 
And the dogs in Indiana 
And all the dogs out in Texas

And for my dogs in Perdue 
And for my dogs in Carolina 
And for my dogs in DC 
And the ones in Mississippi 
I know you dogs in Nebraska 
New place they call Arizona 
And the ???

From the North to the East and West 
Again, in the dirty South, come on 
Chorus till fade
