Souljas:Master P:1:2001-02-03

You in the ghetto
And you ain't got no hustlin' skills?
Get down and give me ten private
(Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?)

I don't know what you've been told
(I don't know what you've been told)
But, No Limit Soldiers came to rock 'n' roll
(But, No Limit Soldiers came to rock 'n' roll)

Where are all my whodis at?
(Where are all my whodis at?)
From the North to the South to the East to the West
(From the North to the South to the East to the West)

Thugged out what we 'bout?
(One two, knockin' boots)
Shinin' it out
(N O L I M I T)

Unnghh
See I'm a thug nigga, and I was born to die
I hang with drug dealers, that's ready to ride
We got beef nigga, then we ready for war
I can't sleep nigga 'til I have my enemies heart

I'm uptown on the blocks with the bricks ba-bay
Fiends roll up and get fixed ba-bay
Fifties and doves or the bic ba-bay
Smoke weed with my nigga but don't trick ba-bay

Now if you step to one of my niggaz, then you steppin' to me
I heard you famous cat, but you don't mean shit to me
I'm out that C P 3 and I'm a soulja for life
And all my real niggaz wild out from left to the right

I don't know what you've been told
(I don't know what you've been told)
But, No Limit Soldiers came to rock 'n' roll
(But, No Limit Soldiers came to rock 'n' roll)

Thugged out what we 'bout?
(One two, knockin' boots)
Shinin' it out
(N O L I M I T)

(What? What?)
Now how the war was won on, blocks in the hood
We got enemies then it's, glocks we pulled
(What)
In God we trust nigga, I ain't got no friends
(Ya heard?)
Souljarettes, they love, money and ends

You need some work?  Meet me in the bricks nigga
You come short?  I'ma wet your shirt nigga
It's like Vietnam on the ghetto in these streets
You die how you live, the strong eat the weak

Red and blue rags for the souljas that be bangin'
And warriors on the wall for the souljas left hangin'
Twenty-one gun salute, for the souls on the street
And the souljas up in heaven, may you all rest in peace
(Ya heard me?)
Unnggh

And we can take it outside if you ready to ride
Them Midwest souljas they be ready to ride
And we can take it outside if you ready to ride

Them East Coast souljas they ain't ready to ride
And we can take it outside if you ready to ride
Them West Coast souljas they be ready to ride
And we can take it outside if you ready to ride
