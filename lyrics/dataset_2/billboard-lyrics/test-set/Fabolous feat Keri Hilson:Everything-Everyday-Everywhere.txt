Everything-Everyday-Everywhere:Fabolous feat Keri Hilson:10:2009-12-26

One, two, R-Les, Loso, we do it like, hey
Yeah, let's go R-Les, just rock with me now
Yeah, yeah
Oh, this next selection, oh

Same shit, different day
Just ride through the city
Looking pretty as they use you
(It's what I do)

It's the same old thing
Got the name on the chain
Just to let them know who's who
(In cause you don't know so)

And they know I'm over here
So they come and find me
Right after they lose you
(What took y'all so long?)

For you niggas in the way
We can let the guns say
"'Scuse you"
(Come on you lames)

At the end of the day
We just trying to find our way
And I might be a come up
(Nice)

And baby you can hitch a ride
But you gotta know how to do
More than how to keep a thump up
(You ride stick, girl?)

It's so incredible
That it ain't edible
But they know the cake's real
(I'm the Pillsbury Dough Man)

Yo, I couldn't even say
Ask these other silicon niggas
How being fake feel

Yeah, everything is my thing, Imma do it my way, everyday
Yeah, everything about me, what they love about me, everything
Yeah, everywhere that I be, feel VIP, baby
Yeah, and everybody's cool, but y'all just ain't me

Somebody better tell em
That we in this bitch
Like an unborn baby
(Hey)

See, we be everywhere
And they ain't never there
Couldn't tell you where they be
(Where you at, baby?)

And you already know
You ain't gotta ask me
You can see that everything is up
('Sup son?)

And I'm so about my money
You ain't talking about no money
You ain't even gotta bring it up
(Huh?)

And I hope you don't think
We give a sugar, honey, iced tea
Or a middle finger up

I just stay sucker-free
Leave the lames where they be
And I let my chips pringle up
(That means "stacked")

Everybody calm down
There's enough to go around
You just gotta say how much you want
(Talk to me)

Don't know what you looking for
'Less it's a problem
I promise this ain't what you want, nigga

Yeah, everything is my thing, Imma do it my way, everyday
Yeah, everything about me, what they love about me, everything
Yeah, everywhere that I be, feel VIP, baby
Yeah, and everybody's cool, but y'all just ain't me

Hey, can you do me this favor
Answer this question
Y'all going try who
(Please)

See the shoes by Gucci
Bag by Louie
The hatin' will be by you
(Hater)

And I appreciate the love
Thank the man above
Cause a nigga feel so blessed
(Thank God)

Yeah, and I ain't gonna stop
Better get 'em red bulls
I don't give these haters no rest

Yeah, everything is my thing, Imma do it my way, everyday
Everything about me, what they love about me, everything
Everywhere that I be, feel VIP, baby
Yeah, and everybody's cool, but y'all just ain't me

Every, every, every, every, every
Every, every, every, every, every

Every, every, every, every, every
Every, every, every, every, every

Every, every, every, every, every
Every, every, every, every, every
