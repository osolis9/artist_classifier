Headlines:Drake:1:2012-02-18

I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night, because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long
I'm floatin' in and out on consciousness
And they say that I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time wit all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?

I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cuz I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't wanna problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that

No, don't do it
Please don't do it
'Cuz one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money
So Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just somethin' they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know

Yeah, that the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's somethin' they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah

I be yellin' out
Money over everything
Money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they missed the old Drake
Girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is... overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like, why I gotta be all that
But still I can't deny the fact that it's... true

Listen to you expressin' all them feelin's
Soap opera rappers
All these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's how you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions

You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cuz I live for this
It isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I don't even gotta say it
They know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know

Yeah, that the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's somethin' they know
They know, they know, they know
I be yellin' out
Money over everything
Money on my mind (mind mind mind)
Tell 'em I apologize
It happened over time (time time time)
