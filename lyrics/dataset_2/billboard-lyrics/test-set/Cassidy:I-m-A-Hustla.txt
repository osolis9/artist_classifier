[Verse 2]

I'm married to the game, same bride just a new groom,
I do more than just do toons,
Cuz my bills coming too soon,
My son gone be two soon,
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon,
But I'm getting my dough from doing shows,
I made more dough on the grind than going gold,
That's why I stay fly I'm flogin' on hoes,
Flossin' so cool in a austin no shoes,
Just a rubberband on my wrist no jewels,
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool,
I know the rules and I got time for it,
But the nigga will shine when it's time for it,
And they will hate you deal with the real cake,
And they on the corner from morning till real late,
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me,

[Verse 3]

To get paid you got saved dont be spending the change,
In 5th grade i was hustling my genesis games,
I was dumb young, selling chewing gum to my classmates,
On the cash chase, moving at a fast pace,
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummys do,
So I had to mil to burn before I turned twenty two,
More money more problems is true,
Cuz the more money I make the more problems for you,
Yeah I use dude voice, props to the boy sean,
He made it a hot line, I made it a hot song,
So stop drawn man you gotta respect it,
I'm the best swizz got it perfected,
Dont mess with C-A double S-I-D-Y,
Cuz I became the best when B-I-G died,
The kid do it big like P-U-N,
Cuz I'm nice like P-A-C with the P-E-N end

I'm a hustla, I'm a I'm a hustla homie, (yeah)
I'm a hustla, I'm a I'm a hustla homie, (yeah)
Nigga ask, Nigga, Nigga ask about me, (yeah)
Nigga ask, Nigga, Nigga ask about me, (yeah)
