I-Just-Wanna-Love-U-Give-It-2-Me-:JAY-Z:4:2001-01-20

I'm a hustler baby, I just want you to know
It ain't where I been, it's where I'm 'bout to go
Take it from the top

Now I just wanna love you, you know I love you
But be who I am, I know you love me
And with all this cash, you'll forget your man

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin, I replace them

Drunk off Crist', Mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
"And I wish I never met her at all"

It gets better, ordered another round
It's about to go down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere

What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You gotta give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

I told you, save the narrative, you savin' it up for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you savin' it for karats
You wanna see how far I'm a go
How, much I'm a spend but you already know

Zip, zero, stingy with Dinero
Might buy you Crist' but that about it
I might light your Crist' but that about it

Okay, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

Hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You better give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

I'm a hustler baby, I just want you to know
It ain't where I been, but where I'm 'bout to go

Now I just wanna love you
But be who I am
And with all this cash, you'll forget your man

Same song, I'm back, been around the world
Romancing girls that dance with girls
From, Club Cheetah to Club Amnesia
The Peanuts in L.A., Bubblin' in Dublin

Can't deny me, why would you want to
You need me, why don't you try me
Baby you want to, believe me

Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You better give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't fool with me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

You gotta give it to me, I said give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me
