Your-Love:Diddy - Dirty Money feat Trey Songz:20:2011-06-18

We in the motherfcking building, a hundred fcking bottles
Yeah... come now
Let go, let go

Girl I want you face down first thing when I wake up
Already got you covered girl ain't no need for makeup

I just need a camera and someone to tape us

Internet ain't ready for the way that we gon' make love

Fiending right now, I need you right now
Tryna hold back but you can get it

Don't tease me right now baby please me right now

Girl scream yes if you with it
Got-got-got-got one question, one question for you

When I'm going through withdrawals tell me what I'm s'posed to do

Cause I need your love I want your love
Girl it ain't the same if I ain't got your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
All I want is you baby

All I want is you baby
All I really want is you
Your touch your sex is my drug all I want is you baby

Only one is you baby, only one is you baby
I'ma-I'ma-I'ma put it in your face boy as soon as you wake up
Know you wanna hit it want me to be your little slut
If you do it good boy I'll return the favor

Baby I'm tired of the bed I wanna try it on the table
Boy I'm fiending it right now man I need you right now
Come a-come a-come a little closer you can get it

Don't tease me right now better please me right now

Let your tongue off on this pussy
Got-got-got-got one question one question for you
When I'm going through withdrawals tell me what I'm s'posed to do

Cause I need your love, I want your love

Boy it ain't the same if I ain't got your love

Your love, your love, your love, your love
All I want is you baby

Your touch, your sex is my drug all I want is you baby
Only one is you baby
Bitch you know I'm Diddy ho
Real deal-y yo
Real estate in the state spilling in Philly yo
I did it for the team I did it for you shawty
I did it for the fans I did it for the glory
Cocky nggas still half cocked in my Yankee fitted
My wrist rocky Sylvester Stallone Jacob did it
Early birds furry furs
His and hers baby girl silver spurs
You know I stay on my grind and she be right there
The sht I'm doing won't be seen and done for light years
Talking me and you the world is ours
All we need is our love money and the power
My love your love
Your sex is my drug
Boy I need your body here tonight

Your love, your love, your love, your love
All I want is you baby, all I want is you baby

All I really want is your love, love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
