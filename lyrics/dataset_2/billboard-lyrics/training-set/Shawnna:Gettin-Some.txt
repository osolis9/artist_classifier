You know u niggas want a bitch like me
Apple bottoms with the wife beater, rockin' Nikes
All the niggas in the hood wanna call her wifey
If u got a pretty dolla then I prob'ly might be

U niggas poppin' collars while yo bitches pop p's
I'm gon' do it for my riders that get down and pop e
Think u can pop me, man u need to stop please
Catch me flyin' thru yo hood in a drop top v

I'm in the pop top three
And ma pops got G's
Say the watch got chilly
And the rocks got freeze

And u broads act silly
Gonna jack my steam
We're slippin' on your bippin' ma
And yo boy chose me

And now he hollin',? Hey lil' mama can u give me a sec?
I got a lil' somethin', somethin'? bout as big a yo leg?
Dis nigga yawnin' while he talkin', so I knew he was wed
And? bout like six in the mornin' he forgot wat he said and I was

I was gettin' some head

U know I keep like 4, 5 woofers in the trunk
And I turn it to the max so u can feel it when it bump
When u go to DTP we give the people what they want
And when they come to hustle Joe u know we ain't no punk

And you catch me in the town we blowin' dro and gettin' drunk
And when we hit the party Joe u know we keep it crunk
Yo nigga actin' tuff he on the flo and gettin' stomped
Don't act like u ain't know now tell yo hoe to pass the blunt

You bitches wanna be me? cause u know that I'm the shit
You see me on the TV? cause I roll wit Ludacris
Don't hate Shawnna baby just be mad at who u wit
I keep a couple handles so u know I'm too legit

Just so u understand it, so u know I'm 'bout that bread
And don't you try to play me for no joke about my cash
Before I get the tip I get the heat up out the stash
I hit? em on the low and shawty this is wat he said

I was gettin' some head
