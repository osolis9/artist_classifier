Get-It-Wet:Twista:12:1998-01-10

Dear love, I was thinking how I should be starting this
Magnificent ways still I can light you like an arsonist
Put my heart in this particularly funny how we start to kiss, marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin' with yo homies gettin' fucked up

I got fantasies of you carrying home
I hope you stayin' alone I'm into givin' pleasure
Echoin' rhythms of my manly moans
Don't be playin' me wrong I'm to grown for games

Mental manipulation ain't the occupation for the playa, I'm strong
'Cuz you see I don't be really quite comin' on the same
Boldly and bodily, fluids with every word that 'curs
Girl you deserve some herb and company to be with

Fuck whoever you were gonna leave with
I'm who you should see shit
I found some love like Adam and Eve, shit
Who you should be with your body I squeeze quick

Stick through the sheets are your arms and see
Don't be alarmed if I make you feel good all over
'Cuz I was droppin' the bomb that's 'cuz I'm in the beyond
Even though the niggaz in the hood is all soldiers

You still a suffer the consequences defenseless
Thinkin' about becomin' my wife if I rock you tonight
You be the love of my life 'cuz I'm huggin' you like I'm huggin' the mic
Plus I'm the one that's rubbin' you right

And able to stick my tongue off in your navel and lick till you drop
Even though I like to stick the twat
I'm realizin' there's variation of ways I can get you hot
I'm in to learnin' you so pick the spot

I'll get pleasure to but let me hush and let the lust get a check
I know you don't want me to hit it yet
But don't be actin' like it's a crime 'cause it ain't been committed yet
But baby won't you let me get it what? Get it wet

(Get it wet)
Gimme some tang and alize let me tickle
Your body, after the party we can pleasure when you come all in me
(Get it wet)
Let me saturate your body with honey

And lick it up stick it up after release and let it 'rupt is it enough to
(Get it wet)
Try to marinate your mind what's up am I deserving your nut just 'cause
We up in the club don't make you bogus if you let me
(Get it wet)
But you be the only that I be thinkin' of gimme hug got me sprung in love

Last time I heard you was playing with emotions and po' pimpin'
All up in the clubs smokin' doves fuckin' hella women
Now negro was yo steelo you wants to get with me though
Then add up them zero's and know though

You ain't know 'bout weed leaves, pussy fees, lex keys
For Ms. Kane see half is for mommy fuck Tommy
Ain't tryin to act Snotty, lick it
Smooth head got you right in the bed

You need another lover like you need a hole in the head
Instead of all this talkin' let your tongue do the walkin'
On down this clitoris
Fuckin' with a wild honey's bitch, ain't that some shit

Guaranteed to get you whipped
Simple kiss from pussy lips gone take a gang of gifts just to hit this
Come take a little glimpse of these sweet hips
When that ass in the air cause an eclipse

On the freak shit
What you know about this slick licks
Send you in a thang when you feel this
Bitch, run from a virgin sip of Bourbon

Get the derb 'n leave you hurtin' certain, steady splurgin' when I'm servin'
Get you wetter than a Persian, the X-rated version
I'm urgin' but I ain't thinkin' you can get it yet
But if you good in a minute you can get it what? Get it wet

(Get it wet)
Gimme some tang and alize let me tickle
Your body, after the party we can pleasure when you come all in me
(Get it wet)
Let me saturate your body with honey

And lick it up, stick it up after release and let it 'rupt is it enough to
(Get it wet)
Try to marinate your mind what's up am I deserving your nut just 'cause
We up in the club don't make you bogus if you let me
(Get it wet)
But you be the only that I be thinkin' of gimme hug got me sprung in love

M-m-m-m, got to be more careful don't hurt 'em girl
You sexy when you mad
Than again come hurt me baby wet me
With a splash aggression of lovin' I never had

As I enter the scene with aroma fresh cologne all that corob on
Flamin' up trippin' while stanky roll on
Herringbone on gettin' my pose on to the liquor I'm on bone
Huggin you like I ain't seen you in so long what's up girl

I execute my unique approach who be the most willin'
To learn and try to be like I got some experience
If you need a coach or we can ride tonight
And kick it like the homies, who?

Only me and you
Smoke B's up like a cigarette till I can only see a silhouette
And even though you won't admit, yet I can tell in time
You want me to eventually wanna let me get it what? Get it wet

(Get it wet)
Gimme some tang and alize let me tickle
Your body, after the party we can pleasure when you come all in me
(Get it wet)
Let me saturate your body with honey

And lick it up, stick it up after release and let it 'rupt is it enough to
(Get it wet)
Try to marinate your mind what's up am I deserving your nut just 'cause
We up in the club don't make you bogus if you let me
(Get it wet)
But you be the only that I be thinkin' of gimme hug got me sprung in love
