Freaky-freaky

Ay yo, I got a resolution, this year I'm playing right
No six fifteen this year, where you can stay the night
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature

I was young and having money, having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'

No room service just snacks and shit
Work with those lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash, let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips, and break 'em with long dick

There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi, that still can buy weed
And can give me some good head and I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

Yo, yo, yo, yo the only thing Bleek spinning is, them chrome wheels
Spinning on them new rims, home suspended from school again
I'm grown, still ill ladies love to be a deal, like Bleek
Can I feel up on your wood and grill?

It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
She give me good brain, love the way I push my slang
Callin' my jack soon as the hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave

Bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy you catch me on anybody's block
Rappin' thug, the Roc, hoes they all clock like

I was the worse, I used to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad for real like I wish he was gay
'Cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with Jay
Just a matter of time she was gettin' with Jay

I'll have your chick in the tropics summer sippin' on 'zae
Spittin' up in the Pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away

Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said, she feel free when she's around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
She on the phone with her friends like how cool is she
