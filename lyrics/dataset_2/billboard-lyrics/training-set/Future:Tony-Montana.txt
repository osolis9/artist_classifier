Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice
Take' em to Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me what you want of me, I'm comin' with a gang of dope
My cigar full of lye, I'm laced up to the fuckin' fo'

A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin' all cash
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin' to the recipe
Slug, deal with Colombians, I know Sosa

All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me heat like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice
Take' em to Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

Another shot of Quelo, she'll be comin' back for pesos
When your blood thin with petro, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split yo title
Ain't nothing about me ordinary, I come with the yayo

I move like I'm odd balls, it's gonna take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then

Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playin' fair
I'm about to cop a tiger and put it in the castle
Freebandz accompany it, so nigga, it don't matter, aye

Accountant in Bolivia, hundred round banana
Twenty five cameras I done broke the knob off
All white Porsche, you leave me no fuckin' choice
Peruvian flight I'm on the way to see my jeweler

Walk inside the bank with so much cash they gon' refuse us
Don't run round this bitch, move unless you get approval
I need a driver to drive me round, look how I maneuver
I'm so fuckin' high right now feels like I'm in Jerusalem

A1, A1 'cause ain't none of this I'm losin'
Every time you see me I'm smokin' low or smokin' super
I would keep it real, I can't tell you who the shooter
All this fuckin' sauce, I really think I come from Cuba
