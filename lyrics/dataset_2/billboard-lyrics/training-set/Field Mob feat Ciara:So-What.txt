So-What:Field Mob feat Ciara:3:2006-09-09

They say he do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He's done alot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got alot of chips
he's so messed up , I heard
He's been locked up
Find somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what

And they say she's a slut, she's a ho, she's a freak
SHE HAS a different girl every day of the week

You too smart You'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard
That they say about me
They say that im this
They said that im that
But some of it's fiction some of it's fact
AND you HATE hearing that about your love
You let it go in one ear and out the other
That he say, she say, they say, I heard
They be fake, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her miserey needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes Theyre nothing but liars hating i bet
They wouldn't mind trading places
With you by my side in my Mercedes

They say he do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He done alot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got alot of chips
he's sellin drugs, I heard
He's been locked up
Find somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what

Mo' money Mo' problems
Life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a wedding
So what, that's your cousin
That don't mean nothing
Her like missing in a tight of affection
You get, you just blind to the facts
See the lies, just obvious she cries for attention
You to the fine just supply your suspicions
But listen, you love me
Gotta TRY TO trust me
Why you stress I'm a high school mess
Break up never, they just jealous
Drama LIKE YOUR mama, mean mug from THE brothers
I'm the author of the book nigga judge by the cover, yes
I-I been to jail, yes
I-I'm grinding for real and
I'm negative, they talking RELATIVE pimp
They hate to see you doing better then them, so

They say he do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He done alot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say:
he think he's slick (he does)
He got alot of chips (spicy thai)
he's cell-in drugs, I heard
He's still locked up?
Find somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what

Some people don't like it
'Cause you hang out in the streets
But your my boyfriend
You've never been here for me
This love is serious
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for you
And I don't care what they say
Some people don't like it
'Cause you hang out in the streets
But your my boyfriend
You've never been here for me
I fuck the thug in ya
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for you
And I don't care what they say

He do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He done alot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got alot of chips
he so messed up, I heard
He's been locked up find somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what
