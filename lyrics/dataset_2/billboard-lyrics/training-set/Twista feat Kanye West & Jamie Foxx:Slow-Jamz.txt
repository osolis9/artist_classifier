I got you looking at the glitz on my hands and wrist/
While im layin back and smokin on my cannabis/
When it come to rockin the rhythm like Marvin and Luther/
I can tell you there ain't no messin wit Kan man and Twist/
From the chi and I'll be sippin Hennesy, play some RandB/
Wanna smoke a B, looking properly feeling on a G and all this (well well, well well)/
Come wit me and sip on some evelyn champagne/
You would know Twista can work it liek the whispers/
Hit the stop light, move into some Issac
His rims still movin, so im pumping little spinnas/
While I'm smokin on a B/
Dippin through the streets
Bumpin RandB/
And I got the heat, on them twenty-threes, and I do it (well well, well well)/
When my earth, the wind smoke and fire/
Let me get ya sheets wet, listenin to Keith Sweat/
Put you in a daze, amaze/
Fulfillin our every temptations, slow jammin havin deep sex/
You ready for the world girl/
Come and go wit me/
I touch you all over ya body baby dont say no to me/
And there aint no noteably controllin me/
I'm lovin the way you be holdin me when I be listenin to Jodeci/
And when I come ova and bend ya ass/
You be bumpin to Teddy Pendergrass?/
I dun hit it from the back/
To the melody and rode it slow/
Now I gotta go up in it fast/
But imma finish last/
No matter how much of a thug you see/
I still spit it like its RandB/
Come to the club wit me/
And when some Luther come on, I hope we feelin me and we can make it lovely/

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then i got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it(Well well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone
Just to get you goin
Tryina make you moan
And i do it(Well well well well well)
