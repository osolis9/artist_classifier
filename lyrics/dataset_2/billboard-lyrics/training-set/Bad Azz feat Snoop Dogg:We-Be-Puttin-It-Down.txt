Word on tha streets, see it ain't nobodies business
Secret to keep, so keep heat, in case things get deep
Peace box is where it starts, scarred flesh and broke hearts
Since a kid, this is how we live

Ain't nuttin' to look forward to schools full of devils
The church don't work 'cuz all the lies
That they tell us, ya'll it'll be hell before we get there
Survivin' guns and drugs and see

If you can deal with this germ warfare that's endin' us
They AntiChrist, I'm antifair, antivice
Antinice, antispice, up your life, I'll make you love it
'Cuz it's real and you bump it 'cuz it's tight

Yeah, people make the world go 'round
And it's a gang of us all gathered up in our game colors
Man, these my gang brothas, what, you ain't heard of us
You ain't never ever heard the word, murderer's

We make the news what it is, you ask what is this
We the reason why the police in business
So run up on us with your knife and your pistols
We'll plague your character with rifles and missils

I dropped my pack and drove my back to the East Side
Smash in this coupe with my passenger Snoop

(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)
Them Long Beach niggas be puttin' it down
Dogg Pound Gangstas make the world go 'round
(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)
So get cha' ass up just to get on down
Snoop Dogg and Bad Azz is puttin' it down
(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)

Them Long Beach niggas be puttin' it down
Dogg Pound Gangstas make the world go round

Never pause on my feet, I'm D P G, L B C, me and B A D
Low ridin' and Navigators foe the haters
I take some for now and save some for later
Smoke with Coke Loc, a dip with Tip Tip
Get heat a chrome plate, a D from Tray Dee

Livin' that D P, give me that S T
In a 4 0 a 0 E from my O G
And a bag of them ol' hot ass skins
Some Colt for this hand
And some juice for this gin

Ain't no bitch like this bitch I got
'Cuz this bitch I got, clock nots and rocks
Money, cheese, paper, fedio get doctor Nedios
And stank is steady goin' bangin' that
Slangin' that and hangin' that every corner

From up north to Dogg Pound California
(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)
You heard of that gangsta ville
The city where they don't talk and everybody C walk
It's a dirty shame but it's a dirty game
And you got to have heart from the start man

Fake snitches and fake bitches
Thats probably why I break niggas and break bitches
Word on the streets Bad Azz is a fool
Then he fuckin' with his homeboy from the old school
(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)
Low life gangstas, Dogg Pound Gangstas

Put them all together, man, I love gangstas
(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)
Head, shoulders, feet and toes
Let's dip to the club and bust some hoes
V.I.P. on D P G, Snoop D O double G and the B A D
(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)

Only talk what you know, I never seen you round the Pound
So won't you keep the East Side and Deez out ya mouth
don't speak on dat, don't bring up Daz and Kurupt
Just to say wussup, nigga hit my blunt
We keep a money move, hate while we regulate

And get real papes, rich like Bill Gates
While you make it to the Haters Hall of Fame
We'll be whippin' Navigators, winnin' this baller's game
Yellin' Long Beach, niggas, keep puttin' it down
Lowlife and at the Pound while we smoke on an ounce
(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)

Steady plottin' on big mail, layin' in the hotel
Chop my quarters down to dubs and watch my dope sell
I hit Darochee come and scoop me
Drop me off and they was Snoopy's, said he puffed a little
Play and Shorty played it only twice

Ay, they set a eight beat, it's them and six hoes in a jeep
They better go flag em' down in the street
Ay, follow us to the spot while the playa hatas pray that we stop

(Dogg Pound Gangstas rip)
