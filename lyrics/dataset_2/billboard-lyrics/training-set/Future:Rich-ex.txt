Rich-ex:Future:24:2015-12-12

I got my diamonds on
You got your diamonds on
Watches on watches
I looked down and see beauty
Baby let's go have rich sex
Baby let's go have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex
Rich sex, bitch
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Baby girl, let's have some rich sex
I'ma keep my AP on while I do it
We can keep an AP on when we do it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
When you look down, see my chains on
When you look down, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, keep my chains on
Baby we can go and have rich sex
Baby girl, go and have rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
Never made love to a misfit
You never made love to a misfit
Come and kick a deal on some rich shit
I'ma keep it pimpin' on some rich shit
We can do the show on the jet lift
Fuckin' in the air on the jet, bitch
We can do the helicopter cruisin' over Vegas
Hundred thousand dollars for a watch, count fetti
Kiss on a nigga with his chains on, glizzy
Fuck so good, got both of us dizzy
Do it lowkey, profile, get busy
Do it lowkey, profile, gettin' busy
Got the Audemars Piguet on fleek
Got my number one freak in the sheets
And all she want is the D
And for me to keep this ice on me
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Baby girl, let's have some rich sex
I'ma keep my AP on while I do it
We can keep an AP on when we do it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
When you look down, see my chains on
When you look down, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, keep my chains on
Baby we can go and have rich sex
Baby girl, go and have rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's stop for a while, have recess
Let's kiss for a while, have recess
Let's touch for a while, have recess
Do it for a while like a replay
Let me see you wind that ass up like a DJ
Run that back like a DJ
I know you see this big face
Chandelier froze for a bad one
Come and kick game in your ear while I smash you
And I keep them thangs in my ear while I'm stabbin'
And I catch you hot like the flame and the passion
And I got the flash on deck, no battery
And I have some Tom Fords on while you suckin' me
Cuban link hang off my neck, to your nip from my neck
To my watch and my chain, it's gon' drizzle, gon' drizzle
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Baby girl, let's have some rich sex
I'ma keep my AP on while I do it
We can keep an AP on when we do it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
When you look down, see my chains on
When you look down, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, keep my chains on
Baby we can go and have rich sex
Baby girl, go and have rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
