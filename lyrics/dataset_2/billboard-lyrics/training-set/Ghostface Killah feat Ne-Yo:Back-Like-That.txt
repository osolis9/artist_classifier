Back-Like-That:Ghostface Killah feat Ne-Yo:11:2006-07-29

[Intro: Ne-yo (GhostFace Killah)]
It's your boy Ne-Yo we're gonna do it like this,
[Kanye West] The Roc is in the building!
I keep telling them the Master Don is in the building
Kanye West is in the building,
Ghostface
your getting fat now.
(Its the remix got the fat stomach I'm laid up
Eating good now,
I got good girl now
other girl all stressed out,
my shorty got that fat ass
shorty mad pulling her hair out... )

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz,
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends,
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that.
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets,
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef,
(Ok girl) what I did was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that, no

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Pardon me if I lost my voice
I just got off stage, I'm in Japan right now, sidebar

I'm high powered put Eva Mendes to sleep,
The part, that bitch been on my mind all week.
But back to this mack loss chick, your waist thick
How you have everything in this world and waste it?
Quince told me it'll be okay,
I'm so sick like Ne-Yo say, I'm laid back like neo soul,
I holla back at this Creole hoe,
She from the N.O. but she never told me N-O so
We hit the spot to chill, where the food get grilled,
She order the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neal
Second I walked in the whole room got still
I don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal.
And she conceited, she got a reason
She gotta her hair did, she got her weave in
And I'ma sweat that out by the evening
You? I don't sweat that now I gotta newâ¦

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz,
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends,
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that.
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets,
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef,
(Ok girl) what I did was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that, no

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Oh girl I can't believe you zoned out
Played me for this dude, nice shoes and a bottle of cold stout,
Ma, I'm that Don Wilson,
First one to put you up 6 weeks in the resident Hilton,
Mink coats, colourful stones and big stacks
Yeah I was f**king, but you don't get me back like that
Causing me grief, you know me and homie had beef,
Now you got me loosing my mind out up in these streets
You flamingo, showing your true colours,
Heard ya'll was ducking down low when you seen my brothers
But its all good I move from ex to next,
I got the baddest little chick to sign off of the cheques,
Fat bubble, her body's one of the best
But I don't need to say nothing just ask Kanye West
She's eye candy, smoother than Godiva chocolate
Now you're mad âcause you played yourself, its your fault chick

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz,
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends,
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that.
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets,
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef,
(Ok girl) what I did was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that, no

[Hook: Ne-yo]
Shot threw the heart the girl got me,
Shot threw the block with him shot gun,
He lucky I ain't stop, copped the shotgun
Killer type cat, better be glad I'm not one.
Had a couple stars out in my sky,
You was my moon and my sunshine,
Dude ain't even fly â" he's just some guy
You played yourself I'm young, peace, one

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz,
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends,
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that.
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets,
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef,
(Ok girl) what I did was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that, no
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz,
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends,
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that.
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets,
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef,
(Ok girl) what I did was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that, no

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
I'm a good dude, you see... yeah...
Females out there that wanna be,
Acting like they getting they little revenge off
Taking it further than what it really is
You know what I mean, playing yourselfâ¦
You know what I mean... this is Don status, girl
You will have to hold that now...
Word up, and when I see money,
I'm gonna hang him upside down and saw him,
It's real, yeah
I got my swagger back and all that
Me and dog for life yo!
Yeah, tattoo on your back and all that
