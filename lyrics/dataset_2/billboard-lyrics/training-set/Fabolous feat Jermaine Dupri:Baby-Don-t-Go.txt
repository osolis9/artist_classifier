Baby-Don-t-Go:Fabolous feat Jermaine Dupri:4:2008-01-26

I'm tryna play cool, actin' like what you do
Don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile, I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryna keep myself from goin' crazy

When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back and I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go

Y'all know what this is
Now I'm better then ya ex, gon' be better then ya next
Baby screwed up, so you betta be from Texas
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turn Neiman out

Nothin' to scream about, just back your Beamer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back the Kima House
'Cuz I could play cool but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?

Better do you 'cause I damn sure does me
And what ya buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, husby never was me, I does me, trust me
I don't want another you so I'ma slide
But I got another boo on the side baby

I'm tryna play cool, actin' like what you do
Don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile, I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryna keep myself from goin' crazy

When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back and I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go

Through the time I been alone, time I spend on phones
Know you ain't lettin' him climb up in my throne now
Baby, dat lime with the Patron had me talkin' crazy
It's time to come on home now

I talk wit someone above
It's okay to lose ya pride over someone ya love
Don't lose someone you love though over ya pride
Stick wit ya entree and get over ya size

We break up then make up at Jacob's, baby
My parents fought too, I'm the make up baby
Wake up, baby, love'll have you open though
I mean, you seen Tom Cruise on da Oprah show
So I just can't bet on da next hand
There's to much in this pot just to give to da next man

I'm tryna play cool, actin' like what you do
Don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile, I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryna keep myself from goin' crazy

When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back and I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go

Now if you ain't never went through it, you ain't really into it
The neck scratches show you I really been through it
Every other day, I'm givin' da love away
That's what ya friend's sister, lil' brothas say

If I'ma do somethin', it's da undercover way
When them hatin' ass watchdogs look da other way
And others may not see dat we need each other
But if we on da same page, we could read each other

They should learn us, instead of tryna turn us
Mr. & Mrs. Smith, we both got da burners up
If you love ya baby then turn this up
Don't we keep it hot like a Thermos cup?
Relax don't be tryna perm us up, we already straight, yes

I'm tryna play cool, actin' like what you do
Don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile, I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryna keep myself from goin' crazy

When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back and I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go
Baby, don't go, baby, don't go

Fab, we gon' have to make a dance to this song, man
You know what I mean?
Ain't no way they can't dance on this
T-Pain

I want my baby back and I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you go
