Now Hit The Dance Floor
Now Bend Your Back Low
She Do It Wit No Hands
Now Stop Pop And Roll
I'm Smoking Bubba Hoe
Now they in trouble hoe
I Like The Way She Move
An Undercover Hoe
Now Everybody Leaning
I Make The Crowd Rock
Now Gone And Walk It Out
I see they on my jock
She Like That Bubble Gum
Is They The Double Meant Twins
2 Hoes Choosing Me
So I Know That Imma Win
It's On Once Again
Patron One Again
I Threw My Head Back
Then I Froze Like The Wind
West Side Walk It Out
South Side Walk It Out
East Side Walk It Out
North Side Walk It Out

They Walk It On The East
They Walk It On The West
South Side Just Got It
And North Side Snap Your Necks
In The Club
On The Goose
Big Stacks
No Flex
These Sucka Wanna Try Me
Tell Dem 2 Long Decks
He Walking Wit His Ones
Steady Smoking On That Fruit
She Walking Wit Her Friends
All in Her Snow Boots
O Shit There They Go
They Walking On The Flour
Grey Goose
Double Shots
It'll Let Ya Body Go
My Niggas On My Side
Hatas Hating Think It's Funny
I'm Walking On These Niggas
Now I'm Getting 2 The Money
Froze On Dem Hoes
I'm Not Talking Bout Dancing
Fool Count On The Charm
Diamond Steady Steady Hancin
