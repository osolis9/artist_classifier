[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Let's start another riot cuz you can't hide
Throw your hoods in the sky if you wanna be down with mine
Pimp gangstas from the south gold grill in my mouth
Tatted out hustler Skinny Pimp talking about
Fake tricks in the game acting lame laying 'em down
To the ground insane when we clown I ain't changed
Still buck too buck North Memphis area
Where I'm from you heard of us haters getting scarier
My cousin Quan in the penitentiary and my Uncle Joe
And I'm in for the ballers and mobsters on the dance floe
You wonder how I'm blowing up I take care of my biz
And I be tearing up the club to make my bank account thick
We starting a riot be aware of the game to hang around pimps that bang we
Watching your set
Now don't throw it up and if you ain't with it quick it or you gon get wet
Now make your money and don't sneak and try to diss me
We finna start another riot live in your city, fool.

[Chorus x4]
Let's start another riot in this junt
If you crunk I know you with it I know you with it

[Whip]
Aggravated mind stated but under gunning
Dropping serious (edit) to have they call me the Tin Turner
Pass the blunt of the gan weed I need to hit it
Whip and Skinny Pimp collabos dropping this real (edit)
From Detroit to Memphis and Dre click up
This track so I can Skinny Pimp this and represent this
Midwest state is getting creative check the mitten
No bull(edit) causing a riot when I be spitting
Keep them amped up dropping bomb rhymes load and blow cans up
Keep your hands up I'm ripping this mic you know the man's up
Riot like it's 2000 G
I'm grabbing the mic splitting the crowd like Moses split the Red Sea
Vigilante know who the man be
Microphone assassin blasting emcees I'm dea...
(Talking)

[Chorus x4]

[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
I'm coming up in this game see I was a long way from home
I'm packing my nuts tryna make it knowing though I have to fire that chrome
I'm drinking that Mo and mixed with Zay hanging in Houston kicking with fakes
Dirty South hold me straight and we never act fake
Jumping on that thug and I showing no mercy I'm breaking laws like Three 6
Gimisum Army got my back with the infrared on them gats
Beware black KKK don't stumble or fall
We cracking jaws when we rumble throwing your head thru the wall
Guests walking backwards in the crowd screaming "Yall ain't no killas!"
Thugging and swinging at your mug like on Jerry Springer
All races yall invited stomp stomp on the floe
Even white people hype like a Van Helen show
Multi-platinum producer L.A.J. got 'em crunk
Ruthless beats be for the streets and knock a hole in your trunk
I'm coming up wilder than ever before look at the Billboard Stars we running my money
Got love in the game got stronger the whole crowd buck jumping, til the New Beginning.

[Chorus til fade]
