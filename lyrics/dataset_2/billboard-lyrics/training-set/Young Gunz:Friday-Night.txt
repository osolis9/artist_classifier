3, 2, 1 Go

(Chorus)
Its a friday night and the bass was bumpin
The honeyz was rockin the party was jumpin
It wasnt long for everybody knew (just blaze)
What's on the B-box (Young Gunz)
Travel wit the heat rock
Before I hit the club hit the weed spot it goes 1, 2, 3, and

(Chris)
Its like king midas as I was told
Young C was on the block 13 years old
I don't mean to brag
I had the meanest bag the suppliers was my peeps
I was bringin half took charge of the block
A pean the ave still bringin cash on the scene
At last still gloves and mask as I proceed mad
mats, mad gats, mad hollow seed
Ya man actin crazy roll wit the kid playa been hella pimpin
You already know what it is, they don't gotta notice the whip
I done show them the wrist, they already know that Chris
And they know tha to stick to the script
It don't last long hit 'em and I last long
Can't drive em south long send 'em in a cab home
You takin mad long getcha bags gone
I ain't got a dime for you time for me pass on

(Chorus)
Its a friday night and the bass was bumpin
The honeyz was rockin the party was jumpin
It wasnt long for everybody knew (just blaze)

tucked the addition we army hit them niggas up
then we breeze off calmly bucky right
behind me the ROC behind me
Yup
