U-Make-Me-Wanna:Jadakiss feat Mariah Carey:9:2005-02-26

Let's go

K I S S me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love

A yo, the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for French curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team it's only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now, she carries the money
The hammer and material across town
And understands she's fine and understands she's mine
She understands the grind, cook, cleans and irons

And whatever she wanna push I'ma co-sign
And if I ain't got it already than I'ma go find it
I guess I'ma lucky don and she's a lucky queen
'Cause her jewelery box look likes lucky charms
All color stones and she know that I'm in the hood
But she also knows that I'm coming home
Mr. Raspy thought I was in love with money
Till the first time we getting nasty

K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love

Uh yo, whatever the road to paradise is, we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything
Even my rhymes
I will play a song for you and you will let me know exactly
How the ladies will respond from a women's point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with a pearl long vickie

The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smells and the way she feel
And the sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so it's crazy ill
And we waitin' on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times, come on mommy, you whilin'

K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love

Uh, when things was rough, only person I could call was you
Now everything I do, I do it all for you
Come touch me, come kiss me
Come love me anyway you wanna, boy

And I'm hood as long as I'm close to you
And we doing what grown folks is supposed to do, come on
Come hold me, come feel me
Come take me anyway you wanna, baby

Aye yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart it's more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we've built
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn, I'm thinking that you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it that's why ma, we gotta make it

K I S S me
Yeah uh, and I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Yeah uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love

K I S S me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love
Yeah uh, I love it when you say
K I S S me
And I just wanna make
Love, love, love

You make me feel love
