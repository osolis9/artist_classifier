Transportin-:Kodak Black:13:2017-11-18

Ain't gotta wait to make the movies, I be loaded
Why you out here drinkin' 40's, I just tote it
Still that same nigga in a foreign, but it's stolen
Ridin' sporty, actin' sporty, I can't control it
I'm doin' five, got that bag, yeah I'm transportin'
I got that bag on me nigga, like I'm Jansportin'
He dropped his mixtape, thought I woulda reposted
I ain't post his mixtape 'cause I don't fuck with shawty

I be booted to the morning, PM to the morning
My lil' woday want a bag, I'm easier when I'm rolling
Hold up nigga, don't you owe me? Yeah you owe me, don't it?
Like I'm in Islands of Adventure how I stay rolling
Try to diss me

I be ballin' on you niggas out of this league

Ain't gotta wait to make the movies, I be loaded
Why you out here drinkin' 40's, I just tote it
Still that same nigga in a foreign, but it's stolen
Ridin' sporty, actin' sporty, I can't control it

It's a Kodak moment, yeah
Bought it 'cause I wanted it

Fuck the law enforcement
Project Baby got no stroller but I keep pushin'
