Come-With-Me:Puff Daddy feat Jimmy Page:1:1998-10-24

Uh-huh yeah, (2x)
Uh uh-huh yeah, (4x)
Yeah.

Hear my cries,
Hear my call,
Lend me your ears,
See my fall,
See my error,
Know my faults,
Time halts,
See my loss,
Know I'm lacking,
Backtracking,
Where I met you,
Pistol packing,
Itchy finger,
Trigger happy,
Try to trap me,
Bad rap,
Wiretap me,
Backstab me,
Break the faith,
Fall from grace,
Tell me lies,
Time flies,
Close your eyes,
Come with me.

Come with me,
Yeah,
Come with me,
Uh-huh yeah,
Yeah.

You said to trust you,
You'd never hurt me,
Now I'm disgusted,
Since then adjusted,
Certainly you fooled me,
Ridiculed me,
Left me hangin',
Now sh*t's boomerangin',
Right back at ya,
Think long-ranged,
Narrow minded,
Left me blinded,
I co-signed it,
Sh*t backfired,
But I'm bouncin' back,
I grinded,
Not many would bear the pressure,
You comprehend me,
You musn't end me,
You offend me,
It's trauma,
Feel the drama,
Come with me.

Yeah,
Uh-huh,
Heh-heh
Come with me,
Don't be afraid,
Yeah,
Come with me.

I close my eyes,
And I see,
You--standing there,
I cry,
Tears--of sorrow,
I die.

Uh-huh,
Yeah.

Fuck my enemies,
Fuck my foes,
Damn these hoes,
Is steppin' on my toes,
Back up off me,
Take your hands off me,
Give me room to breathe,
I'm not hearin' it,
I'm not fearin' it,
I'm up to my ears in it,
Bullshit,
I'm destructive,
Some women find that seductive,
Some say it's lunacy,
But luckily I've been movin on,
I ignore you,
Sorry if I call you,
I neglect you,
Don't mean to disrespect you,
Can't you see...
I love you dearly,
And not sincerely,
But you annoy me,
You can't avoid me,
I'm here to stay,
Forever,
And ever in a day thats never,
I can't let you go,
I can't forget it,
Why you did it,
I won't permit it,
I won't acquit it,
I wanna to fight you,
I'll f*ckin' bite you,
Can't stand nobody like you,
You can't run,
You can't hide,
No surprise,
Close your eyes,
Come with me.
