Young bloodz, back on mo' time
Wanna get yo Billy Dee, ya know I got mine
Gettin' the club crunk, damn near drunk
Roll wit forty five, twelve Peeves in my trunk

Give ya what ya want shawty, got what ya need
First some Billy Dee, second drank Hennessey
Center of attention, all eyes are on me
Oh, that's Sean Paul a.k.a. Sean Grease

Oh, never mind him, 'cause he always on that soft
And roll wit a group of felons that'll rip you off
He slum as hell, seven golds in his mouth
He slizzard as hell, always hollin' 'bout the south

And every week at the club he always get kicked out
I really think they hatin', tell me what is this about
But everythin' good, 'cause we gon' keep it crunk
And Colt forty five gon' forever get drunk
