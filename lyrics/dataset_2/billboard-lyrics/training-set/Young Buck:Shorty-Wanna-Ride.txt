Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
Oh you ain't never been to the dirty, dirty before?
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
C'mon ride with Young Buck

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me

My 24's spinnin', the sticker's still on 'em
The same old hoes, but a nigga still want 'em
I'm parkin' lot pimpin' on another nigga woman
She pullin' up her skirt, tryin' show a nigga sumthin'
Ya' car cloudy, my niggas all rowdy
This Hennessey got a nigga drowsy, I'm outty
Now where them hoes at, look I'm tryin' to take you home
So what'cha got ya girlfriends, bitch bring 'em on

Hoe I'm tryin' to break a bone, when I get in them draw's
To the window, to the muthafuckin' walls
What a nigga don't know wont hurt him'
If ya' got a old man, bitch I ain't worried
And I got plenty room if ya think you wanna roll
See this is what they make Cadillac trucks for
Let's go to a place you ain't never been, down in the country
I bet ya, I have ya sayin' ya love me

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me

She ain't got a brain, the liquor got right
It's aight, 'cuz, you can be my wife, but only for tonight
Get ya ass on this bike, I can show you I'm a rider
The 600 Coupe, with the old school wires
Giovanni rims, with Perelli's on the tires
They said 22's wouldn't fit, but they liars
We can take a trip to the hood and back
Then go and get a room, how hood is that?

What'cha waitin' on Shorty? This the chance of your life
What I mean what I see in them jeans, what I like
You don't know what your missin', just quit talkin' and listen
See I'm just holdin' up traffic, I'm just right here sittin'
Think about it for I bounce, and you holla, I'm wrong
And ya' see your best friend, in this Impala, ridin' on chrome
If your ballin' in your money long, you can relate
But all them broke ass niggas gon' hate

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me

You can bounce if you want to, freak if you want to
G-Unit in this bitch, Shorty, what you gon' do?
Buck if you 'bout that, I can make 'em bounce back
G-Unit in this bitch, Shorty, where the south at?
Bounce if you want to, freak if you want to
G-Unit in this bitch, Shorty, what you gon' do?
Buck if you 'bout that, I can make 'em bounce back
G-Unit in this bitch, Shorty, where the south at?

Wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
We can get low, hop into the Chevy four door
Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me
Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug
Don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
Don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
Don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me

Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
Don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me
