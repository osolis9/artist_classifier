Uh, it's Diggy
Queens, you with me?
Yeah, let's get it, let's get it

Uh, check my million dollar swag
I tell 'em 10-4 cause they wanna copy that, uh
In the mall, lotta shopping bags
Baby girl, what you want? Your boy got the tab

If ya man say, "Where you at?"
I'ma tell 'em, "I ain't seen her"
Better hit her on tje jag
She's gone for the evening

I make 'em lean back Don Cartagena
Yeah, you know what's up Martin, Tommy, Gina
I'ma leader like Derek Jeter, they copy my demeanor
I'd be jocking I know they're watching, they act like I don't see 'em

I'll never stop
Keep me on the job and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm on and I be in my zone and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm gone

My shoe game look here I'm rockin 'em
Moccasins or go Jeremy Scott on 'em
Louboutin look like they got spots on it
My ratings up cause everybody watching it

I be V.I.P., you on line where the rope is
Don't come any closer, you might step on my cultures
Ladies it's your jam leave you jacket on the sofa
Have a little class, put your glass up on the coaster

Get it on the floor shake it
Shake it like you're supposed to
If you know getting over
Tell 'em copy, copy, over

I'll never stop
Keep me on the job and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm on and I be in my zone and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm gone

Copy, paste
Copy, copy, paste
Everything that I do, they tryna do the same
(The same thing)

Copy, paste
Copy, copy, paste
Tryna do it how I do it, they can't do it like me
(Do it like me)
Copy paste, copy, copy, paste, copy, copy, paste
Copy, copy, copy

Copy, copy, paste
Copy, copy, paste
