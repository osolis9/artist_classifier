Tupac-Back:Meek Mill feat Rick Ross:22:2011-07-09

Tupac back, Tupac back

There's all these bitches screaming that Tupac back
All eyes on me, better Picture Me Rollin'
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming Tupac back, Tupac back

There's all these btiches screaming that Tupac back
Huh, Tupac back, I'm 2 glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly this the new Iraq
Soon as I hit the the hood they screaming who got wacked
It's a recession on the work, I'm screaming who got crack
I'm sippin Hennessy, riding on my muthaf-cking enemies
Sliding in the back screamin MMG (Maybach Music)
10 bitches and they dime so it's Tennessee
Hail Mary, put my wrist on froze
Presidential is gold
n-gga play with my money my Jeweller lifting his soul
40 kick like in soccer? Bullets hittin' the goal
Bitch I'm like John Wall cause I just give em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen

Got a put my cologne, all them snitches could hold em

Look at them muthaf-ckin' wheels, them bitches is stolen
They screamin'
Tupac back, Tupac back
There's all these bitches screaming that Tupac back
All eyes on me, better Picture Me Rollin'

Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming Tupac back, Tupac back
There's all these btiches screaming that Tupac back
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
Catch the n-gga that did it, and we gon' carry his head
F-ck 911, tell em have him in?
Talking Death Row records, tell em have me a chair
Let it burn, I'm screaming free my n-gga Earl?
He's due in, no hestitation we can't even get a turn
And my Mackaveli CD then I listened than I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OG's say hold it firm
I'm dreaming spitting with Pac, cyphers with BIG
Try to send me upstate with the license?
Had me scraping ym wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed

Got a n-gga on point like there'sa price on my head
I going max, got me knocking suckers and they back
In the cell, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don't ever get it twisted it's Meek Mill spittin' facts
PLus somebody said they seen it and they mean it so they steady screaming
Tupac back, Tupac back
There's all these bitches screaming that Tupac back
All eyes on me, better Picture Me Rollin'
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming Tupac back, Tupac back
There's all these btiches screaming that Tupac back
