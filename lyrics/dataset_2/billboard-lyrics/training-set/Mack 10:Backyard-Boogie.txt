Backyard-Boogie:Mack 10:5:1998-02-14

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Saturday mornin' at the crack of sunrise
Thank the man upstairs for lettin' me open my eyes
It's a whole new game for me like T-Lee
It's nine-seven now and I'ma stay sucka free

Thinkin' about all my homeboys behind bars
As I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars
And everthan' is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin' paper every day, it's all I'm trippin' on

'Cause ain't nothin' like a ride in California
With the top back, rollin' on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin' all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies and mashin' to the backyard boogie

Get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on
And we comin' wit that

Backyard boogie oogie oogie
(Yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie
  (It's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie
(Unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie
  (It's the backyard boogie)

Backyard boogie oogie oogie
  (It's the backyard boogie)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie
  (It's the backyard boogie)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie
Backyard boogie oogie oogie

Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin' where you from, 'cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
Been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf

So I bails in the party, everythan' is cool
It's niggaz in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes, 'cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews

Just gettin' they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin' loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin' back and I'm usually chicken hawkin'
The bloods shootin' dice, and the crips are C walkin'

Now the party is jumpin', and the crowd's gettin' bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin' and humpin'
'Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin'

Unh, straight from Inglewood
And you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
And we comin' with that

Backyard boogie oogie oogie

  (And we comin' with that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie
(Yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie
  (Get yo' boogie on)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
Ain't nothin' but real niggaz, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
And Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang

You choose or you lose while you conversatin'
Enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin'
I want homegirl over there in all red
'Cause baby got backs like Mix-a-Lot said

When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
'Cause a Mack 1 0  just refuse to save a hoe
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
'Cause she gonna lead a backyard boogie with me

Get yo' boogie on, yeah
Get yo' boogie on, yeah
  (Inglewood)
Get yo' boogie on, yeah
  (Inglewood)
And we comin' with that

Backyard boogie oogie oogie
