Sexy-And-I-Know-It:LMFAO:8:2012-02-25

When I walk on by, girls be looking like damn he fly
I pay to the beat, walking on the street with in my new lafreak, yeah
This is how I roll, animal print, pants out control
It's real fool with the big F O
They like bruce lee rock at the club

Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out

When I walk in the spot, this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
(show it, show it, show it...)

I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

When I'm at the moss, purity just can't fight them up
When I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We hit it to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shows, no shirt, and I still get serviced

Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out

When I walk in the spot, this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it
(show it, show it, show it...)

I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it

Check it out
