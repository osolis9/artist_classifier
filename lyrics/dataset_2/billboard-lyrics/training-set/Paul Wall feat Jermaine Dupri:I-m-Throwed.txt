I-m-Throwed:Paul Wall feat Jermaine Dupri:21:2007-05-19

Y'all know what this is

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds, you can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it sound like this, this
It's that H-Town, baby, you know what it is

(I'm throwed)
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
(I'm throwed)
Four deep in my old school car

(I'm throwed)
Show Cali while I'm bangin' the screw
It's the ice man, baby, you know what it do
(I'm throwed)

I'm fresher than the fruit bowl, leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the dome, freestylin' like hair braids
Makin' that candy dance, I'm throwed off the Cali plants
I'm prancin' on the scene, crawlin' down like fire ants
My mind in a trance, I'm sharper than starched pants
Stackin' franklins and grants from South Bank to Spring Branch

I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash
I'm wheel grippin' and still trippin', brandy wine on glass
I got a screen in the dash, a quarter tank full of gas
Smokin' that puff, puff, pass, throwed, I hope I don't crash
Reppin' the Swisha blast, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird
Throwed in the mode game, cold as a iceberg, baby

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds, you can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it sound like this, this
It's that H-Town, baby, you know what it is

(I'm throwed)
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
(I'm throwed)
Four deep in my old school car

(I'm throwed)
Show Cali while I'm bangin' the screw
It's the ice man, baby, you know what it do
(I'm throwed)

Now to broads, I'm a sharp-shooter like Steve Kerr
Flash the wrists, cause a blur, fox fur and flyin' spur
Undisputed for sure, so I'm collectin' these dimes
Name and number, lil' momma, 'cause it's checkout time

I'm slidin' on glass threes, inhalin' the chronic trees
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STDs
I'm cool as a ocean breeze, like Chester, I'm chasin' cheese
I'm stangin' like buzzin' bees, on South Lee with the cheese

That's why screens fall like all them leaves, makes the TV's rain
Take a picture if you please, yeah, my wrist is insane
Thirty karat diamond chain, so ballin' is off the chain
Mind frame, I'm stackin' change, I'm so throwed in the game

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds, you can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it sound like this, this
It's that H-Town, baby, you know what it is

(I'm throwed)
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
(I'm throwed)
Four deep in my old school car

(I'm throwed)
Show Cali while I'm bangin' the screw
It's the ice man, baby, you know what it do
(I'm throwed in the game)
(I'm throwed)

I'm full of that purple Sprite and I'm searchin' for broads
Paper stackin', so my money stretch like extension cords
I'm a wide body rocker in a four on them choppers
I'm on the grind, stackin' up my mail like the post office

Movin' at slow pace with T. Farris, my ace
Cup full of expensive taste, open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed with screens hangin', swangin', breakin' his trust
We pourin' up in them cups, that stuff got me leanin' tough

Hold up, I'm caked up, so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like Asafa Powell out there, runnin' the track
Pullin' capers, makin' paper, stacks fly as a dove
A bread breaker, taste maker, baby, all of the above, I'm throwed

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds, you can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it sound like this, this
It's that H-Town, baby, you know what it is

(I'm throwed)
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
(I'm throwed)
Four deep in my old school car

(I'm throwed)
Show Cali while I'm bangin' the screw
It's the ice man, baby, you know what it do
(I'm throwed)
