Hood-Figga:Gorilla Zoe:7:2008-01-19

All the girls jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Shawty you can hate but ya gurl steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a ****, she poppin'

We bottle poppin', you youth blockin'
Told the gurl you rap, but ya CD floppin'
You say you gettin' money man, we ain't seen nothin'
Ya gurl is persistent, she ain't stoppin'
Man she say she want a

Hood Figga
I keep the people by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town

Hood Figga
And I keep a bad chip around
Big chip, long hair
Yellow, white, red, brown

Hood Figga
And my Chevy sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks
Pancakes, you ain't know?

Hood Figga
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk
Hood Figga

And I don't need a scale for the work
I can eyeball gurl, I am not you jerk
Hatin' on me'll make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse

All eyes on me, shawty I'm up on first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle me hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church
Man this rap stuff is easy, every beat I get I murk

â€~Cause I'm a hood Figga
I keep the people by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town

Hood Figga
And I keep a bad chip around
Big chip, long hair
Yellow, white, red, brown

Hood Figga
And my Chevy sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks
Pancakes, you ain't know?

Hood Figga
I'm a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk
Hood Figga

Get it like you, naw, get it like me
Eveesus we don't rock white tees
Classic Capris, button Knicks on my feet
I count with Bathin' Apes, 10 pair every week

Menage a 3, the gurls s*** me to sleep
Z-O-E climax to the beat
I C U naw U C me
You'll see ICU *****n' with me

â€~Cause I'm a hood Figga
I keep the people by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town

Hood Figga

Watchin' out for goldiggers like Kanye
But I will pay Beyonce, or Ashantay
Make Keyshia Cole say she should've cheated
If she eva come my way

Get some **** from Fantasia on the highway
Trickin' off Majic City every Monday
It ain't trickin' if you got it dat's wut I say
You say? I say and wut I say goes

The trunk stay bumpin'
Y'all know we run the town
