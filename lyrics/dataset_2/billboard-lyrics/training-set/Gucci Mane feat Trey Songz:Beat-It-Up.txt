Beat-It-Up:Gucci Mane feat Trey Songz:22:2011-01-08

It's four in the morning, she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gonna get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he could lay it down
Said he could lay it down

But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, said he could lay it down
But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, he could lay it down

I hope up out my bed, set my swag on
Scrambled eggs, filet mignon, two trees blown just for cologne
Money never limited, So Icey with benefits
My driveway need a passport, all my cars are immigrants

It's so sickenin', history of weakness
And I had a girl, she quit me now, I'm single, wanna get with me?
Sticky cannot stick to me, if you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confronting 'ruly, ain't my fault your lady choosy

Four-thirty, still blowin' purp' it, O.A. Verdy rollin' dirty
Want you clean, that's just detergent, got your girlfriend pickin' purses
Say she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person
When she get me home, my nigga told me that she love my verses

It's four in the morning, she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gonna get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he could lay it down
Said he could lay it down

But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, said he could lay it down
But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, he could lay it down

Your girlfriend keep callin' me, I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me, so mornin' it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it, P-Nerd down straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets, got your blanket at the laundromat

Way baby girl throw it back, old man might get heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there, smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate, Holiday C mess with that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the internet

One, I will not finish yet, never been a minute man
Always been a business man, gather checks in Filas, man
That amount? Oh, really now? Actin' like I give a damn
Used to like 'em, now I don't, got a real short attention span

It's four in the morning, she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gonna get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he could lay it down
Said he could lay it down

But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, said he could lay it down
But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, he could lay it down

Gucci, Trey Sonz, put it on, my shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song, she got on my favorite thong
She too hot, too hot to touch, to feel it too much for lames
Gucci Mane, I'm extra strong, so extra rubbers on my brain

Got your main thing screaming Gucci, every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often, but I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet, Barbie, Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem, pop her 'til she call me papa

Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the meshes poppin' rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the meshes poppin' rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

It's four in the morning, she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gonna get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he could lay it down
Said he could lay it down

But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, said he could lay it down
But I'ma beat it up, I'ma beat it up
I-I-I'ma beat it up, he could lay it down
