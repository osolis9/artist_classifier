Snapbacks and tattoos
Snapbacks and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks
All that 'cause cash rules

Snapbacks and tattoos
Snapbacks and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks
All that 'cause cash rules

Show off your hats
Show off your tats
Show off your arms, legs, chest, show off your back
Snapbacks and tattoos
Snapbacks and tattoos

All that 'cause cash rules

Ok now snapbacks and tattoos
Rap phat I'm that dude
My backpack got cash that
I make an a clap like tap shoes
I'm international
Y'all ns vaginal
I pass through, fresh to death
You've now entered swag school
Ladies holding kisses
Swag as cold as sickness
Teen Driicky tatted on 'em cause they're a is so ridiculous
In the 'Mazzi, paparazzi
Man they can't control the pictures
M-O-B tat, screaming money over bes
My clothes and tats they're all custom though
Something that you ain't accustom to
Don't collapse with the Huxtables
Hoes like hats they adjustable
This is for my ladies and my fellas getting gravy
But your body's marked up, like the train back in the eighties
I've been through the test
Now, ink on my chest
Trying to triple my chest
I spit through the rest
Buy you a Mitchell and Ness
Fly and it'll fit you the best
From N-Y to L-A
North Cackalack to Baton Rouge
All across the latitude
Everybody rockin' them

In my hood they wear them snapbacks and tattoos
Clack clack and snatch jewels
Pack tools, Crap shoot
And sell crack in glass tubes
Our chicks, attitude
Hard enough to get at a dude
Tatted up, fattest butt
Suck it off, vacuum
Trips to Miami Ink
After that, Lowrider
When I say we're balling trick
I don't mean no globetrotter
Driicky is a monster, ain't a heir up in his safe
Since I murder raps, I should tat a tear up on my face
Can't you hear this flow, it's evil
Can't be near us close to lethal
Y'all are weird
Yo I'm just here to spit 'bout piercings, clothes, and needles
Grab some cheer-up for the people
Rappers fear 'cause most are feeble
I don't have to smoke I rap the dope considered so illegal
To all my Gs up, can I just get a witness
If you're inked up, throw your feet up
Or you're stylin' in a Mitch-Ness
Ain't leaving out my females
I'm talking 'bout that a too
Show 'em all
Roll call
Let them bes know we wear them
