Like-You:Daddy Yankee:22:2005-07-09

Yo!
Its your boy!
Daddy Yankee!
All my Latinos stand up!
Marcando la historia
Caminen comigo en esta!
Holla back. You know how we do man!

(Chorus)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)

(Verse 1)
Straight up, you's a bad ass, baby you hot
In the hood you feel the tension when you walk down the block
Thats the reason you mujers got me, believe it or not
Me and you can run the world like Biggie and Pac
Cause you my main homie, my main shorty
Cock back hammers and bang homie, protecting our gauge slowly
With a girl like you, forget the nonsense
We'll be the most talked about like the chicos and gossip
Dime!
(Daddy Yankee is shining right now)
Come on cop me now, I got this game locked down
What you know about big things, strong wheels, strong bills
Me and you holding it down, its so real
Come On!

(Chorus)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)

(Verse 2)
Yo! La negra tiene tumbao
Cuando camina de'lao
Por la calle ocho sin miedo we be wildin out
Switching lanes on the freeway, corriendo por miles
A little four play like Bonnie and Clyde en el crimen
Touching you is not a felony
How am I a playa, ma?
Do I look like Bill Bellamy?
No te molestes yo soy tuyo na' mas
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot

Tu eres la chica ideal para mi (All I want is a girl like you)
Como tu nadie nadie me a hecho sentir (All I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)

O! O! O! (All I want is a girl like you)
O! O! O! (All I want is a boy like you)
O! O! O! (All I want is a girl like you)
O! O! O! (All I want is a boy like you)

(Chorus)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)

Yeah!
All my Latinos stand up!
Caminen conmigo!
On the floor bussing
Daddy Yankee! Barrio Fino!
And I'm proud to be Latin man.
Letting you know this is real.
