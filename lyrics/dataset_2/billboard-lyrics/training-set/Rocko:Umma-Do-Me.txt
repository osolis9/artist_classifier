Umma-Do-Me:Rocko:7:2008-02-23

Listen to the tracks

Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, umma do me, umma do me, umma do me

You wear Reebok, I wear Bally
You smoke Michy, I smoke Cali
You wear Enyce, but I wear Louis
I drop 600 boys on these Guccis

You really like her, you might wife her
I don't like her, so I one night her
You make it sprinkle, I make it tsunami
You get chump change, but I get money

You like dancin', I just two step
You like to trick off, but I don't do that
You don't tote what, I keep that tooly
Wanna see how it's done? Watch me do me!

You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me

Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me
Watch me do me, watch me do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me
Watch me do me, watch me do me

What's that, new Dolces? These here chrome heart
You need a key for yours? Me, mine will auto-start
Man I talk to the car, the car talk back
Then I step up out the car, watch the car back back

Yo' money funny, my money talk
While we talking money, look, this how money walk
Playa why you limpin'? It could be two things, like what?
Them fifteens or whole stacks in my blue jeans

That's last year's model, me, I'm in that new thing
Black flips, black sack, call 'em shoestrings
Aye who you wit? Frank â€~n Roll best thing since the TV
Pay attention let me show you how to do me

You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me

Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me
Watch me do me, watch me do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me
Watch me do me, watch me do me

You like the fo' door, me I just do two
If you ain't getting money, then I'm nothin' like you
I'm from the ol' school, you from the new school
My ol' school cost more than your new school

Just got a new school, that's what I'm used to
Suede around the panoramic equals clear view
You in my rear view, yeah you history
First to second, two seconds, I love a six speed

I swag it out, uh felt my swag
The shoes match the hat, the hat match my bag
These haters mad, you don't like it, then sue me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me

You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me

Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me
Watch me do me, watch me do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me
Watch me do me, watch me do me
