Killarmy
Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars
Wu-Renegades
Intro/Chorus:

Yo, Killarmy, we the last armaggedeon
Prepare yourself now for the six man wettin
In the streets, or in the sand war is on
Now aside nigga here comes the pride

Verse One:

You can't persuade this brigade Killarmy renegade
on this crusade lyrical murder is sure to be my trade
Drill more heat than Black Suede, I'm the sun
beamin on your dome when the shade is nowhere to be found
All you hear is the unreknowned sound
that makes your eardrum pound, you can't avoid it
It been exploited in your district
The ballistics are statistics fuck the critics
They criticize while I revise my enterprise
Do the knowledge and you'll be surprised
?Generalize and currency alive?
while strong soldiers build with boulders
Forts and barriers, my brain pattern hold weight like a freight
Sharp like ice skates, blows this track like a cellmate
Then motivate, now I'm out of state, usin my Papermate
to penetrate, through open minds that take the time to listen to
The Crimson Tide that I provide, I dedicate
my life to my poetry, if it's meant to be then let it be
It's only right I'm out for the night, my life's a legacy

Verse Two:

Yo, it's like I remember slapboxin now we clap shots to catch props
From knockin rocks on the block ?to chop the fat priced and jock?
I see the Jakes and motivate cause half my team be holdin weight
We march across the Golden Gate Bridge
My mind is in the solider state
Forever real, troops'll never squeal, so my Beretta's peel
leisurely, and penetrate your mental shield, easily
I'm pleased to be, the man hundred grand, the tan Lands
Now my Clan's doin tours in Japan and San Fran-cisco
liver than disco packin nickel plated pistols
and keep my block hot like burnin Crisco
Wu-Renegades, deadly switchblades

Chorus 2X

Verse Three:

Check it out, yo, yo
Renegades are slayed in steel cage, that wave war blades
at United Snakes parade, the unforgiven law no mercy
Build controversy, then perform surgery
Killarmy, we meet at a ninety degree angle
Universal star angels, we form the tip of a triangle
like Egyptians did, I perform inside pyramids
Wu-Tang, a scientist, label me the last lyricist
for today's Genesis, surrender
Take you on an adventure like they had kidnapped seven ninjas
Supreme marine I move in submarines
Anti-murderer, stage burgaler
Rugged rhyme ?asserter-er, with the righteous crutches?
Lyrical ruckus, build to destruction, Destructicons
Best to kill or camouflage, Desert Storm
On the battle before I lost a arm
Held on to my sword took both hands like Voltron
Like the master who's imperial, king of the scenario
To all my universal soldiers, salute the general

Verse Four:

I come armed with explosive chemicals just dream me in physical
Killarmy individuals the concept of principles that are highly
indispensible
My name is Born God Allah, King of North America
On a ship I was stripped of my knowledge and wits
Death to all enemies, by your own fuckin penalties
Off with your dome I roam through your war zone with a platoon
full of soldiers with dust bones
Ain't nuttin but the army shit, one minute til we all hit
Tie you up with your barracks
With heat-seeking lyrics and my ?royal friends from the tribe of
Indians?
I break down your physical change it to a chemical
you cats are made of wickedness, the black man be original

Chorus 2X

Let it vibe, homicide, suicide
