Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
You don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome the christian in christian dior
Danm, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask cause I'm not sure, do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in presence of greatness cause right now that has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I'd even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit
Specially on my best stand on my bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homey take six, and take this haters

Me likey,
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand "yous" there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?

This is louis vuitton dime night
So we gon' do everything that kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a klondike
I'd do anything for a blond dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're making it
Harder, better, faster, stronger
