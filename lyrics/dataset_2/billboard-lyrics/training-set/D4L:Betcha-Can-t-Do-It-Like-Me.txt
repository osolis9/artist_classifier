Put your right leg up, left leg up
Sit down like your sitting on the steps
Look to the left, look to the right
Look back at the booty and stare

Now twerk, twerk
Now twerk, twerk
Now twerk, twerk
Now twerk, twerk

I can't take myself when I step up on the scene
And all these haters jocking cos' they know my swag be mean
I can do it by myself or I can do it with my team
But, when I'm with my brothers we just hit that dream team, now dream team
Dream team, dream team
I'm like what these haters mean
Dream team, dream team, dream team
I'm like what these haters mean
I'll double tap the right, double tap the left
Swing yo arms three times aye,
Do yo dance, do yo dance
Switch to the other side aye,
Bunny hop to the right, bunny hop to the left
Pull to the right two times aye,
Look to the left, feelin your chest
Now gone break it down, ay gone break it down aye,
Gone break it down, ay gone break it down
I say gone break it down, ay gone break it down Aye
Gone break it down, ay gone break it down
I say gone break it down
I been flexin since a youngin
I keep money in my pocket

Seen them, hey day need to stop it ay,

But, I don't like the swuh, you can watch me hit the dolphin ay,
