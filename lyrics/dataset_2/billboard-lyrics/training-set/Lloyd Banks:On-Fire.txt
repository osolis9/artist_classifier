On-Fire:Lloyd Banks:2:2004-09-11

New York City
You are now rocking with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit

We on fire up in here
It's burning hot, we on fire
Shorty take it off, if it get too hot
Up in this spot, we on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
Light the roof on fire
Uh, nigga what you say?
We get loose in this motherfucker
Light the roof on fire, fire, fire

Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
Twenty-six inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon' last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rose gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamonds by the pair
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear

Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80's man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I ball packed clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting wrong deals
I'm only twenty-one, sitting on mills

We on fire up in here
It's burning hot, we on fire
Shorty take it off, if it get too hot
Up in this spot, we on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
Light the roof on fire
Uh, nigga what you say?
We get loose in this motherfucker
Light the roof on fire, fire, fire

If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I don't hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her Momma taught her
And I don't care what the next nigga bought her
'Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her abuela
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spending quarters

So cut the games Ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to cum when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B; diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

We on fire up in here
It's burning hot, we on fire
Shorty take it off, if it get too hot
Up in this spot, we on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
Light the roof on fire
Uh, nigga what you say?
We get loose in this motherfucker
Light the roof on fire, fire, fire
