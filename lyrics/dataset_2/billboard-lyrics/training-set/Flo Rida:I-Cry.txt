I-Cry:Flo Rida:1:2013-03-02

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh, no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a Croward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box juste the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Get mad â€˜cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I or jealously was not oppressive
Oh, no, I can't stop, I was destined

I know

Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh, no

Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little

When I think of letting go
Go, go, go

I know

Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh, no

Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed ought the outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck just kill critics
Buggati never when I'm rich, just God fearind
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr mike caren, tell his Billir Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh, no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Go, go, go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh, no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
I know, I know, I know
I-I-I, I think of letting go
Go, go, go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh, no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh, no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
