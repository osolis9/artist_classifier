Da-Bridge-2001:QB Finest:17:2001-03-03

Aiyyo calm down, fall back
Y'all Queensbridge always fightin' up in here
Ladies and gentlemen
We got Queensbridge finest up in this mothafucker tonight
They just came from war
They wanna let you know a little somethin' about where they come from

The-the-the bridge, Queensbridge, the-the-the bridge
The-the-the bridge, Queensbridge, the-the-the bridge
The-the-the bridge, Queensbridge, the-the-the bridge
The-the-the bridge, Queensbridge

You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place

Hip hop was set out in the dark
The bridge was never over, we left our mark
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to kill that noise

If you was an out of towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin' them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field

So many names, don't got time to spit 'em
But through my rhymes they livin', we the bridge through tracks I'm givin'
Never lose sight, 41st side's my life
The 40th side of life, dunn we keepin' it tight

Yo, it ain't just the music
Group aspirations or ghetto illusions
It's the product, east side and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin' through each buildin'

If you sleep, you better wake up, as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist, there's no denyin' the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it

Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualities
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me

The ill will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death tracks feelin' me
Six blocks, losin' my mind, runnin' from D's
These P's got me usin' my nine, I pop off

Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks strippin' over strollers
(Slippin' sova)
In queens, you be the victim till you get to know us

Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin' it crunk
So much be jumpin' off, I ain't sleep in a month
Y'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, you can't peep it enough, you in the bridge nigga

You must pay homage to my projects, we thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us from rap to the crack suppliers
Out of towners get knocked off, we regulate blocks laws
I had the hood like watts flooded wit cop force

Q.B. to the cracks in the pavement
Mister everything that [Incomprehensible] pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholdin' the ring where Q.B. is King, what

Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, Q.B. bust they gun
Keep them P.C. niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis

The last verse, "T O N Y" remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who wanna set it

Yo yo move
Me and my dogs comin' through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get ranked on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns

2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin' downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms

We party hard at the bar
Buyin' bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar
The head niggas in charge
We number one, Q.B. there's no competition

Infamous records, bars and hooks listen
Littles Noyd and mega
We independent, dunn we infamous mobbin'
Gog nitty and twin in
The ill will bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium

Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin' wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, wanna know whose life was written

The life I'm livin', the ice the women
The kites that sendin' to lifeless biddin'
The streets to prison, I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin', laser, A.R. fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin' bound

Your hoe, your man, Lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?

Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed 'cuz

Keep on rockin' the bridge and keep rockin'
If the beats stop rockin', the bridge'll keep rockin'
Keep on rockin' the bridge and keep rockin'
If the beats stop rockin', the bridge'll keep rockin'

Keep on rockin' the bridge and keep rockin'
If the beats stop rockin', the bridge'll keep rockin'
Keep on rockin' the bridge and keep rockin'
If the beats stop rockin', the bridge'll keep rockin'
