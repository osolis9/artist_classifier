It's not alot that you've been saying
Wo-oh

But'You ain't gotta say too much
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language

You ain't gotta say too much

Said you ain't gotta say too much
Hate when you say that I play too much
When I get too close Imma touch that subject
I can read yo' body, nough said
Quit all that yappin'
Meet and lets talk in a lil' more action (Yeah)
Now girl keep it G, know you speak a lil' freak

That ass worth all that worship
You been in yo' bag like Birkin
Never had it like this before me
