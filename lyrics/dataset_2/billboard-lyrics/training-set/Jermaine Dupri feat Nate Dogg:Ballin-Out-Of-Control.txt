Ballin-Out-Of-Control:Jermaine Dupri feat Nate Dogg:14:2001-10-13

Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don chi chi
(That's me)
Rollin wit'cha nigga Nate D
You know these niggas straight bang
Big game D, ballin' with the 21st Street

Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don chi chi
(That's me)
Still makin' tight-ass beats
I'm rollin' in my brome, I stay sweet
Ain't nobody ballin' like me

It goes, mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the biggest baller of all
I got a 700, a Bentley and a Magine
The girls just die when I'm ridin' past

Live life like I'm sellin' pies
Ah-rabian with two or three wives
Two or three houses to hide, ten cars that's parked outside
And they all got bodies that's wide, follow me

As the Leer jet flies, over Crimson Tides
Four bedroom duplex in the sky
Nicknamed Lottery 'cuz I don't stop spendin'
When the wheels stop, the chrome keep spinnin'

Like the six moon-walkin', shit I ain't talkin'
I'm straight livin' it, it's a wonder I ain't shiverin'
I'm so frozen and you've been chosen
To roll with me and Nate D O double G, sing

It's five o'clock in the mornin'
I've already downed five, I've already downed five Mo's
See ya around my block on the weekend
All we do is chase bad, all we do is chase bad hoes

Ask me, what we did was crime
If not then I just say no, then I just say no
Three girls a date, that's my limit
We ballin' outta control, we ballin' outta control

Now whether you like me or not whenever I drop
You know, I give you number one hits platinum hot
It's so much clarity in my rocks, I'm thinkin' like
It's gotta be somebody greater, maybe it's not

'Cuz I flow for those, that get that dough
Hits for every chick with a size C tits
See it's like this, I don't mind wavin' at you kids
But I can't manage to raise my wrist

Jewels so heavy, y'all fools ain't ready
My twenty-two shot the streets into confetti
Move like Andretti, redlinin'
Whatever city I'm in, headlinin'

At five a.m. I'm still lookin' for mo'
Still gettin' crunk, still lettin' it flow
Bar outta Cris' now I'm drinkin' Mo'
Stomach upset, I feel like I'm about to let it go

It's five o'clock in the mornin'
Got my pedal to the flo', got my pedal to the flo'
It's time I test my 600
Wonder how fast this bitch go, wonder how fast this bitch go

Three girls and two of 'em sleepin'
One got her hands on my bow, one got her hands on my bow
Sun's comin' up, we still drinkin'
We ballin' outta control, really ballin' outta control

Dance, everybody
And everybody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
Everybody just clap ya hands

Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
And everybody just clap ya hands
Lemme see y'all dance, everybody
Everybody just clap ya hands

Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don chi chi
Rollin wit'cha nigga Nate D
You know these niggas straight bang
Big game D, ballin' with the 21st Street

Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don chi chi
Still makin' tight-ass beats
I'm rollin' in my brome, I stay sweet
Ain't nobody ballin' like me
