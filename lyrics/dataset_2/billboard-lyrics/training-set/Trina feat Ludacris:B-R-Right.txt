B-R-Right:Trina feat Ludacris:24:2003-04-05

I want my ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Wait bitch, I'mma blow my kisses
Get pissed and throw my dishes
Y'all niggas know jus' who this is
Woo woo, and the head so vicious

With me, this shit gon' cost
You short? Then tha's yo lost
You know this ass is soft
Make a nigga goto breakin' off

Tell me that you love me baby
Get hot and fuck me crazy
Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch wit no type of flaws

My gurls be shoppin' hard
These hoes be buyin' cars
In the club buyin' bars
Nipples hard in designer bras

From the niggas who gettin' cheese
Throw back in the crispy G's
More wet? Crist don't freeze
Laugh at the tab, 'cause this on me

Me and Luda in the cut supreme
Doin' things jus' to touch the cream
So many names, wanna fuck the queen
I live a life like it's jus' a dream

I want my ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Get it right brother, jump
Gimme the beat then I'mma make it bump
Tell 'em wutcha wana hear, damn, let's get cam
Trouble witcha man, I'mma pop my trunk

You ain't seen no chicks like mine
You ain't seen no flicks like mine
Bet I make you
Next to the subwoofers and my six by nine

Tell me that you like it raw
Tell me that my dick is plump
I might make you famous
And buy you watches by Marice Mc.Craw

Tell me if it's new or old
Tell me if it's hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold
Say Ludacris six million sold

See I ain't got no time for games
And I ain't got no times for lames
How you lovin' my southern slang
Ooo eee walla walla bing bang

So anytime you need me call
Whether summer, spring or fall
It doesn't matter, come one, come all
Either get dropped or drop them draws

I want my ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Diamond princess
Just mind your business
These rumors are senseless
Your whispers are endless

We livin' ghetto fab
We spendin' hella cash
This girl is hella bad
Your choice is trailer trash

Too much taste for whores
You saw me grace the stores
You watch me work the vibe
Bitches, I works for mine

One time, for these divas
Two times, for these visas
Third time I come, I'm breezin'
The ice just keeps on freezin'

Hold up, I'mma keep it goin'
Back to back, I'mma keep on blowin'
Platinum plaques, keepin' it up
Wet sex, keepin' it good

Look girl, you don't know my angle
A hundred thou with a platinum bangle
My niggas'll slow your roll
Pussy power, we in control

I want my ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Yea, tha's right, I'm back again, 'round two mother fuckers
Tha's rite, I'm talkin' Greece, I'm a arrogant lil' motherfucker, huh
Tha's rite, I'm rich, I'm that bitch, tha's rite
I'm about show y'all how to pimp this shit
I'm fuckin' niggas in the face, the game is mine, two thousand and three

Fuck that, fuck all y'all haters, fuck all y'all bitches, get a life
You got too much time on your hands
I want y'all bitches to get a job, up your game
Pimp your game up baby
It's all about me this time, fuck that, fuck a dime
I'm a silva dolla, holla, catch me when I come off tour, fuck y'all, I'm out
