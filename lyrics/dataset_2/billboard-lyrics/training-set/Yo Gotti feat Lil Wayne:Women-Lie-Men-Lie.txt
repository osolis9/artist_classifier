Ay, step up in the party and them bad bitches be on me
I be sippin on Patron when I’m jumpin out Ferrari’s
I be rockin Gucci sometime Louie, I’m retarted
And dem rims by Asanti But the shades by Bulgari
Hand on my scrap I got my mind on my money
i got my mind on dine and he aint takin nothing from me
headed on this choppa tek
headed on this choppa tek
headed on a hunded round cuz thats how much the cheapest sh-t
ballin is my hobby got a homie goin shoppin
5 star with me a milli in a lobby
Took her to the room, she hit me wit that line
Said she aint that type of girl so I told her stop lyin

Young money, yeah, ok,
I aint gotta lie, cross my heart hope to die,
the numbers don’t lie, G-5 over sky,
I f-cked her p-ssy good, make her cry if I tried,
I’m tired of being sick and I’m sick of being tired,
tired of these n-ggas and tired of these b-tches,
sh-t let em lie as long as they aint snitching,
and men lie about women,
and sh-t women lie about plenty,
They aint lying on me Im in the bed with 2 fine b-tches lying on me,
so that would make 3 and numbers don’t lie,
and money don’t lie,
and neither do I,
B-tch!

[Yo Gotti]
I’m tryin to count to a billion, my bitch brazillian
Hop in that Lamb, push the button, lose the ceiling
Sun out no rain drops, postin the same spot
Right here in North North Memphis
Where I came from
Hundred on the neck, I aint never had sh-t
The streets gave me family, Barry White cut the check
Aint no secret in the streets, n-ggas know I got neck
Got the swagger through the roof, I was born just to flex
Zip code on my wrist, phone number in the bank
In my ten til six with my 305 paint
I got my 357 and my 501’s
In a Lear 55 wit my Air Force One’s (NO LIE)
