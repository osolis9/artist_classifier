Money-To-Blow:Birdman feat Lil Wayne & Drake:2:2010-02-20

Yea, coming to you live from the city of Houstaltantavegas
So what it do young nigga'? 100
I am on a 24 hour
Champagne diet
Spillin' while I'm sippin'
I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just sayin that cause
I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it
Boy I'm on that fly shit
I am what everyboby in my past don't want me be
Guess what, I made it
I'm the muthafucking man
I just want you to see
Come take a look
Get a load of this nigga
Quit frontin on me
Don't come around and try to gas me up
I like runnin on E
I-I-I
I'm on my Disney shit, goofy flow
On records, I'm Captain And my new car is Rafio
Damn
Where my roof just go
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin somethin' cause that what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leavin girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts
I say damn, "where my roof just go? "
Top slipped off like Janet at the Superbowl
I got em
They can't help it
And I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous
BITCH I got money to blow, gettin' it in
Letting these bills fall over your skin
I got money to blow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I got money to blow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I got money to blow
Richer than the richest
We Certified gettin' it, CM, YM, Cash Money buisness
Higher than the ceiling, fly like a bird
Hit the Gucci store and later get served
We smoked out with no roof on it
Them people passin, so we mash 'em
Ballin' out, we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghinis and them Bentleys on the v-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
Car of the year, Ferrari, the new Spider
No lie, I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich, born uptown, born to win
Fully loaded, automatic six Benz
Candy paint, foreign lights with my bitch in
Born hustlin' too big nigga to strive me up
Can't stop me more money burnin' em up
They can't help it
And I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous
BITCH I got money to blow, gettin' it in
Letting these bills fall over your skin
I got money to blow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I got money to blow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Well I get paid every 24 hours
Money and the power
Come to VIP and get a Champagne shower
I don't have to worry because everything ours
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
That kush
I promise
That's my dude, but we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
And I'm with two women make you take a second look
We poppin' like Champagne bottles but we never shook
And we gon' be alright if we put Drake on every hook
They can't help it
And I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous
BITCH I got money to blow, gettin' it in
Letting these bills fall over your skin
I got money to blow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I got money to blow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, got money to blow
CMG Baby
Yea, just like that
Blattt
