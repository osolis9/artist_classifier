Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like bust
I just came from YSL just like I'm from Boston
Just like I'm from Boston, just like I'm from Boston:
Thugger Thugger, you
I want Michael Jackson land, ohh
Aww Imma cash out on it
I'm high as hell ain't got no satellites on me
I tell that bitch I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel just like Fabo FA
I'm back at it, Juug man voice
Bankhead
Hear my song way from Y-T-C-R-O-B-S-M-M, now we YSL venom
Slime Thugger wit it, Slime DK wit it
Slime Wicced wit it, Slime Mondo wit it
Slime Slugger with it, Slime Bubba wit it
Slime Check wit it
Count hundreds and fifties off everyone titties::
Running that money up
Like ya 'bout to start trial
When you beat the case, turn into a stoner ciao
We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet
Everybody stoned, weed, lean
Every time I walk inside the club I see everybody looking
You know I'm a stoner I love drugs and I could never be tooken
And you can suck my banana but I won't eat your pudding, so come a lil closer So my bitch won't know ya
Andalé andalé andalé
How the fuck a nigga think he gone survive on a YSL runway (how fool)
My glasses are metro like burn off your chest
And I control ya ho like net and flex
Your bitch at my dinner she wet like a fish
I took off her three legs, T-Rex

Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
I'm a motherfuckin stoner

I just put a forty on my wrist just like a bust
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a bust'
I just came from YSL just like i'm from Boston
Just like I'm from Boston, just like I'm from Boston
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel just like Fabo
