Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit

I got a chip in my engine, 26 inch rims
Got fade away money, bitch I'm ballin' out the gym
Got my old school pumpin', hit wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke, you out yo' monkey ass mind

Diamonds on my pinky, hand on the pine
Touch and die, yo mama do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga what

Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got g's on my ass, bitch it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can go on and pass the mike, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck

Still screamin' out mayne, pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed, throwed in the game
Big face on my chain, 84's on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me

The name you know of
A little bit change now your boy done blown up
And I'm doing things that gets exposed
Stuntin' ain't a thing to me
And it's obvious it's plain to see

That you are going to make us both, get into some things
That'll scare grown folks, they might even say
You should leave me alone, don't be scared
You need to get like me

Stuntin' is a habit, just gotta have it
Shawty can throw anything at me
I'm gonna bag it, when she sees the carrots
They real just like a rabbit, can't no other boy
Do the things you like

He ain't your type, change your life
But if you did your homework
Girl I'm pretty sure you know what I got
Drop top, singing know Jones and Banner gonna roll
Let me stop

Look at who's the boys ridin' Maybach
I'm in the candy, laid back, like I slang crack
My money's stacked to the ceiling
Getting in my Chevy's like climbing up a building

Them 28's on deck, 37 on my wrist, 105 on my neck
This rap money's ok, want you to see these movies checks
And it's cartoon path to SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, while old schoolers gettin' pissed

She opened up her arm, but then she slit both wrists
They go to suicide doors, wood on the dash
Bare steels on the toes, I got [incomprehensible]
Got some chrome on the nose, the white boys go â€~sweet'

The black folks go â€~ohh!,' I got a â€~lac full of ammo
I'm brick with the 9, I'm throwin' bombs out the Lambo
Them butterflies throwin' up, I got Chad in my heart
And DJ Screwed in my crunk

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me
