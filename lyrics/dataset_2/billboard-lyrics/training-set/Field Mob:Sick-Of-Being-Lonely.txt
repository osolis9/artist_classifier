Sick-Of-Being-Lonely:Field Mob:5:2003-05-03

[verse 1]
little shawty, we used to be on the phone all day
talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head
now today seem strange
no call on my celly, no name on my caller id
callin' you up and ya ogs sayin' you ain't home
what's really goin' on? i wanna know
so gimme a call and let's play no games
i'm playin', you want the plane
don't point a finger over herre
i bought you a fur coat for your birthday
and this the things i get shorty?
over there you starin' mad
that i went out with them other chicks
i told you they ain't shit!
they were just some buddies from high school that i went to
where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
but i called you up but you wasn't home
baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
i'll be waitin' at home
[chorus]
i'm so sick of being lonely
every night while my man goes out with his homies
i wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved
sick of being lonely
every night while my man goes out with his homies
i wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved
[interlude (sung)]
any other night, you'd be at home waitin' on me, yeah
(what's goin' on?)
any other night, you'd be actin' like a bugaboo, ooh
(what's goin' on?)
any other night, you'd be callin' me, stallin' me, ha
(what's goin' on?)
any other night, i can guarantee a page from you, ooh
(what's goin' on?)
[verse 2]
hmmm, but tonight seem different
man, it's about this fishy (i'm so confused)
cuz i ain't even get shhhh
my wife ain't hit me on my pager or cell
and when i call her, i keep gettin' the damn voice mail
what's goin' on? yeah i know i'm wrong
for goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'
hopin' ya "home alone" like caulkin
but i picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected
[chorus w/ad libs]
[verse 3]
i'm so sick of bein' lon-
ahh, don't finish yo statement
you alone call me, i'll be yo replacement
put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
cuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
from the field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
tenderized and yummy, the energizer bunny can't compete with me
cuz i be goin' and goin', rowin'
with mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'
something so pretty as you at home alone
that's unbelieveable, like when the cow jumped over the moon
now, i never put nothin' before you
that's like eatin' cereal, pickin' a fork over a spoon
[chorus 2x]
