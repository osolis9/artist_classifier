I-m-The-Ish:DJ Class feat Lil Jon:22:2009-04-25

Yeah Baltimore Club Music
Yeah I'm the ish
I got these diamonds on my neck
Got patron in my cup
If you want it come and get it
Shawty I don't give a f***

See it's Friday night
And I just got paid
I done had a hard week
Now it's time to celebrate

Well the DJ played my ish
Some of that club music ish
Make the girls wanna freak
Back it all up on my ****

See it's on tonight
Trying to leave with something right
I'ma grown *** man
So Shawty you can spend the night

Cause I'm the ish
Yeah I'm the ish
Up in this b****

I got a crib down the hill
And we on Reistertown
Girl I'm hardly ever home
Because I'm always out of town

Is that your girlfriend
I really like her
Her booty's fat like yours
I really like her

I know the club is 'bout to close
But it's only 3 o'clock
They hating and they hating
Cause I got this thing on lock

Why the two baddest b***** in the club
Going home with me

Cause I'm the ish
Yeah I'm the ish
Up in this b****
Up in this b****
Yeah I'm the ish
Yeah I'm the ish
Up in this b****
Up in this b****

Yeah I'm the ish

Up in this b****
Yeah I'm the ish

Up in this b****
Up in this b****

See now I'd probably been in this ish the longest
I don't deal with the fake and the phoniest
Girls treat me like I'm one of the Jones's
Give her d*ck and all types of bonuses
I don't really even know who song this is
But I heard it and jumped right on this ish
If the shoe fit you better wear it
And I swear it you see me

She asked me what my name is
Told her I was famous
You don't know who Jermaine is
She must be brainless
Since the day I came in
Don't know where them lames went
But that ain't no issue
Baby get your boy some tissue

Cause I'm the ish
Fish you as my whistle
Got your chick she doesn't miss you
She'll be with you when she kiss you
She'll be licking on my missile
No homo see my logo
And you'll hold shows like its promo
Its tight I had to force it
Now they call me porcelain

Cause I'm the ish
Yeah I'm the ish
Up in this b****
Up in this b****
Yeah I'm the ish
Yeah I'm the ish
Up in this b****
Up in this b****

Yeah I'm the ish
Yeah I'm the ish
I'm the ish
Up in this b****
Yeah I'm the ish
Yeah I'm the ish
Up in this b****
Up in this b****
