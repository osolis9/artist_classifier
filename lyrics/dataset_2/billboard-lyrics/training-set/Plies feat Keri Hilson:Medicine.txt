Medicine:Plies feat Keri Hilson:21:2010-02-20

Baby if you don't feel good right now
And your body hurtin' you right now
You just need a shot of me
I'm jus like medicine

Shawty I'm your insulin
Baby I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need, I think ya need ya medicine
Baby I'm your insulin
Shawty I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need, I think ya need ya medicine.
I'll be your prescription
Come and take a dose of me
Once you get a dose of me, you'll think that I'm your medicine
Shawty you my medicine
Your medicine
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need my medicine

One teaspoon of me is somethin' like a bag of blow
Too much of me too fast and you'll overdose
Treat ya like a newborn
Baby I'll feed you slow
And if I really fucks with' ya I'll give you a double dose
I'm your lil' double stack pop me you really roll
Night time, day time, I can give it to you both
Anytime you want it I can give it to you that's for sure
Keep ya up all night I can be your no dose
Need your prescription see or holla at me
Let me know
Call me or text me baby when you need some more
I give you becky baby when your body sore
This is exclusive
You can't buy this in the store

Shawty I'm your insulin

Once you get a dose of me, you'll think that I'm your medicine
Shawty you my medicine
Your medicine
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need my medicine

I can treat you any way ain't gotta put it in your veins
Went in the first two seconds you'll feel da change
Only did stuff for that you might feel is good pain
One side affect of this medicine is butt game [?]
A half dose of me and I promise you won't be the same
Addiction to this medicine is common
Don't be ashamed
And if you feel a lil' woozy after this
Just hold my hand and I can numb your whole body just like novacain
I can make you come back
You can call me Cocaine
And if you take this first dose good I'm a up ya range
On your prescription it will read Plies name
The rest of your life you will not accept no lames

Shawty I'm your insulin

Shawty you my medicine
Your medicine
I think I need, I think I need, I think I need my medicine

Call me when you feel bad
Call me on your sick day
And I swing through and make sure your fever go away
I can make you sweat it out
Sweat on me it's okay
Don't worry about your hair gettin' messed up, it's okay
I get it redone for you baby I pay
And If it's top notch and it feel good I stay
I drink straight Yac
Need no Rose
You want it say, "I need my medicine"
That's all you gotta say

Shawty I'm your insulin
Baby I'm your insulin
I think ya need, I think ya need, I think ya need ya medicine
Baby I'm your insulin
