I got my own voice (blessed), sing my own hooks (blessed).
Fresh fade nice smile I got my own looks (fresh).
I just like to make people happy (forreal), four kids I just like being a good daddy (best daddy).
But I'm a gangster and I rock shows (you ain't seen my shows).
A people person, so you know Lil Boosie got hoes.
Damn hoes that's a figure of speech get a lot of shit like that when you listen to me.
As for my fans, I love y'all straight up y'all apart of me so when they hate, they hate us.
Money keep a nigga going the better things (house) mane I take it to the bank I don't make it rain (boss)
but I'm fly like Weezy (waddup Weezy) plus the hood niggas,
mane they believe me like Jeezy (waddup Jeezy) and I just like to have a good time hit the yo,
smoke one, and put my life in my rhymes.

Father forgive me I was raised on some real shit, so I can't sugar coat shit not a lil bit.
Inside I'm sad about my daddy, since I lost my grams I ain't been given a damn,
but I still hold my head high and sometime I cry but when I cry man I don't know why.
I feel trapped to be a superstar (forreal).
A hundred thousand worth of jewelry to end it and I spend it with no problem.
You don't like badass then that's your problem M.O.B. wouldn't give a damn if their hoes holla.
Love cars, love broads with a passion I ain't ever had shit so I'm flashin (do yo thing).
I work hard go and get it on the road seven months runnin seven-fifty off for shows get it.
I'm hood rich, still smoking that good shit, still got the same hood clique straight up.

I told my teacher to her eyes I'ma make it there,
she ain't even looked surprised gave me another F or a fucking D happy you got a C.
Fuck the world lately, be whatever you wanna be.
Ain't nothing like a strong mind and some confidence whenever you step out of line,
it's a consequence we all overseas, we puffin weed, we'll make you niggas bleed yes in fucking deed.
Seven fourty-seven yelling seven fourty-seven.
On the real we gotta be a couple miles from heaven, the world tried to pull us down but we ain't fuckin let it.
I would have did some of it different but I don't regret it.
That's one thing about me though I never been a quitter.
That seizure shit crazy, shout out to the hospital.
Rest in peace ma I'ma be on TV (watch) Young Savage, Sweet Jones, Trill Family
