Its-Every-Night-Sis:RiceGum feat Alissa Violet:25:2017-09-09

Yo, I wasn't about to go in but like
Now I feel like I have to, you know?
I mean, I feel kinda bad but like, fuck it, haha
Alright, yeah

I can tell that you came with the Disney flow, ayy
Ain't nobody ever heard of your Disney show, ayy
Got a bitch that remind me of my cereal
From Britain, when I see her, I'm like "cheerio"
Yeah, Alissa called asking me if we could win against Jake Paul (what)
I said, we Gucci like the shirts with the snakes on it
I just heard the song, Team 10, now I hate ya'll
Logan, that will be your last hit like an 8 ball

Nah, wrong Paul, yeah it's Jake
Like from State Farm
Get girls, but the hooker said you paid for it
Me and Rice in a house with like eight floors
Ride your brother's nuts, you're a squirrel for his acorn

Ay, You got girls? Where they at? Are you serious? ay
Didn't see 'em, like George, I'm just curious, ay
Alissa said you cum fast, like the Furious
Diss tracks, you are my reflection like a mirror is (hooyah)
Wanna flex on my wrist, I put some ice on it
I'm a make her wet, then put some rice on it
Talk shit, now I'm on your head like some lice on it
Heard that you used to bully kids back in high school (ooh)
Second part for he kill that's what Rice do (ooh)
Hit it twice this ain't Insta, I don't like you
Gotta put this rice in this beef like some Thai food
You ain't got no bars, no flow like a lake do (shit)
Rented cars and the Rollie lookin' fake to
Let's go back to the bully thing. listen here
Was it back in middle school or was it senior year (what)
Didn't think you'd get caught like an interference
Pick on others just to hide that you were insecure
How you think they felt when they went home and they were dripping tears
You cheated on a good girl, Tessa's hideous
And then you went and got a big head like you Phineas

It's everyday bro with the same bully flow
Bully at school, now bullying your bro
Diss your own brother, I don't really get it though
Stop bragging just accept nobody knows your Disney show
It's everyday bro with the same bully flow (what)
Bully at school, now bullying your bro
Diss your own brother, I don't really get it though (yah)
Stop bragging just accept nobody knows your Disney show (bitch)
Should've never cheated now, never cheated now
Got fame from your brother now, from your brother now
And he's a better kisser now, better kisser now
Now I'm onto bigger things, bigger things now

Should've never cheated now, never cheated now
Now, I'm fucking on your bitch now, on your bitch now
You used to be a fan and you still a fan now (what)
They gon' call me "RichGum" 'cause I'm dumb rich now (what)
