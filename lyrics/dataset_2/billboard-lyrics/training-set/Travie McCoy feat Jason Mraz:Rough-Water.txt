Rough-Water:Travie McCoy feat Jason Mraz:20:2013-12-14

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I'm sinking

Loose lips sink ships that's what someone told me
But this boat will stay afloat for as long as you hold me
We been through rough water anytime it was tougher
But the fact I came back to remind you I love ya
And if that's not enough, well I can one up ya
I pinky promise touch thumbs I'll never make you suffer
And all I ask in return is some reciprocation
I'll be your oxygen when you're running out of patience
So take a deep breath, and hold it tight
My heart is yours just reassure me that you'll hold it right
Don't be offended, I'm just the cautious type
To always be around and hold you down and never under, like

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I'm sinking

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh

This is my message in a bottle, I hope that you receive it
If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It's destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they'll never get it
I'll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic but I never take it for granted
I'll hold you â€˜til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You'll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I'm sinking

There's times where like
We find it hard
To hold on to something
That was never meant to be held onto
But you let it go
If it comes back it was meant to be
If not, just let it be
C'mon

Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I'm sinking
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh
