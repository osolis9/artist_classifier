Fly-Together:Red Cafe feat Ryan Leslie & Rick Ross:22:2012-01-14

so when i fly you fly we fly together
and when i shine you shine we shine forever

i'm a boss so i need a boss chick
and we can boss up like the bosses
all about green like paul pierce
mayweather flow look zero losses
dime in the day, diamond at night
five star chick 'bout that five star life
i must admit i'm a fan
your shoe game ruthless girl god damn
been a few years you're my number 1
blood in my veins, breath in my lungs
we the ones winning so they want toast
we an item blend like rum coke
love the way you're doing it, keep doing it now
fly like a jet blue stewardess
you can fly alone but i don't advise it
i'm inviting you to fly with the pilot

so when i fly you fly we fly together
and when i shine you shine we shine forever baby
so when i fly you fly we fly together
and when i shine you shine we shine forever oh yeah

she wanna hit me on the ichat on the ipad, flying in the sky caps
shawty got a nice job but works too hard
quit that shit tomorrow welcome to the mall
i need my women mobile
double m g is globalâ€¦
i ain't rocking no polo but i'm driven to shine
her heart beating so fast cause i'm taking my time
yeah i get it and lick it, i just handle my business
now she know the difference
and my bentley just different, i keep her by my side
my life a runway, and it's time to fly

im a boss so i need a boss chick we can play house in my 4 tricks
v kicked up corner office
roxy princess in my crosses
she wanna tip em all down so i let her do
i got a credit card and a debit too
i like your attitude
like im supposed too
so i poked you
niggas couple on campus
styling em all on prom dances
you know how i do
toss keys to valet on arrival
he aint here like a hostage
your my better half like a full length ostrich
anytime you fall through its like a blood bath
swag killin em when they ask for my autograph

so when i fly you fly we fly together
and when i shine you shine we shine forever baby
so when i fly you fly we fly together
and when i shine you shine we shine forever oh yeah
