Where would I be
Without you baby

Whenever you need me
If you want me to put it on you, come on

Whoa, whoa, oh

For that you'll forever be a, part of me
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we BABY
When you cry who wipes your tears (you)
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothing to fear (you)

When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on, your soulmate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Yo, and I appreciate the rocksand gifts that you cop me baby
And that house on the hill when you droplike 80 (yeah)
On the down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a caugth in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And I respect when you flip, cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for the 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in july it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never (hmm)
Heart from heart, knew that it would last forever
