Purple-Lamborghini:Skrillex & Rick Ross:7:2016-10-01

Biggest boss and I been the trillest
I'm a bigger problem when I click with Skrillex
Murder on my mind, it's time to pray to God
My revolver is not religious, the revolution's born
You wanna know my name then go and tell them Sarg
You wanna know my gang: Suicide Squad
Pistol on my waist, I might make a mistake
Dead shot, head shot, oh my god, am I crazy?
Drugs every corner, this is Gotham City
Killer Croc came to kidnap you, to cut out your kidney
Ain't no mercy, got that purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Rozay, don't you know that pussy worth it
Flooded Rolex at the Grammy awards
They still sellin' dope, that's those Miami boys
Killers everywhere, it ain't no place to run
Forgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun

Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin (Rozay!)

Don't be beggin' for your life cause that's a lost cause
High stakes, body armor, suicide boy
There's a time for games and there's a time to kill
Make up your mind baby cause the time is here
Capital murder, capital letters
Yeah she catchin' my vibe but she can't fathom my cheddar
Need a couple gang members for these new endeavors
From this point on anything we do, we do together
Body on the corner, million in the trunk
Seven figures, I will spend that every other month
Killers on the corner, talons in the clip
Villa Palisade and Paris just to fill with bitches
Say my name and I'm coming with the gun squad
Everybody runnin', homie, there's only one God
Cocaine white Ferrari, I'm in the fast lane
Every day was life and death, that's when the cash came
Count money, drug residue even blood on â€˜em
He had a driver 'til I put my cuz on it
Kickin' in the dope boy, Suicide Squad
Needle in my arm so I'm do or die for it

Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy
Got that purple Lamborghini lurkin', (Rozay!)

(Cash money)
Dope boy

Real hip
Forgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun
(Rozay!)
