Doin shows in a recession
Dey cars get declinned
Now dey sufferin a depression
While I'm spendin meals
Signin all kinda deals

Eatin 5 star meals
My whole life style
Like comin to america
All my louis luggage
You see my bag how I carry ha
Walkin through the airport
Like I'm in a parade
On my hollogram
Loggin on the e-trade

Dats a 5 star chick

[Nicki Minaj:]

Fendi on my slippers
And my cookies always slippery
I don't need help

So I be yellin fuk'em
With a dildo sign
5 little mama
You a 3 star
I ain't sleepin when I say
I'm in my dream car
Oh did I stutta
Harajuku hyphen
Barbie
I'm hot I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair
I was gluen my weave in
When you hit the stage
Dey was booin and leavin
Yuh money red flag
No more auditio'(n)s
