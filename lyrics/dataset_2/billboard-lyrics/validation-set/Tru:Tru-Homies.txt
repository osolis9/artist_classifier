Tru-Homies:Tru:6:1999-08-28

Yo Silkk and C-Murder, just remember
As brothers, blood is thicker than water
And cant no man, women or object infiltrate this family

When my Tru homies call me, Ill be there
When my Tru homies need me, Ill be there
I'll be around

Damn, it feels good to be Tru
That's why I gotta represent the tattoo
We roll deep when we creep in the streets
And stay strapped just like the police

No Limit or should I say the army
I feel like, cant a damn thing harm me
You dont want to go to war with a soldier
'Cause Tru villains throw nothing but boulders

My click assist of hard hitters
A bunch of use to be thug villains
And nobody dont mess with name one of us
'Cause we make a lot of bustas run from us

Aint no such thing as a fist fight
You getting jumped, so you better have your mind right
Give me a call when its time to bang up
And Im there before the phone hang up

When my Tru homies call me, Ill be there
When my Tru homies need me, Ill be there
When my Tru homies call me, Ill be there
Ill be around

I knew one day, my time was coming
But my whole world changed when I put Tru on my stomach
And nigga Tru stand for keeping it real
That's why we ride for our homies when our people are killed

I love my momma and my daddy for planting my seed
But me and my homies reminisce over Hennesy and weed
And all my loved ones lost trying to hustle and bang
I make R I P songs, just remember your name

And now Kevin, you a legend
Even though it send chills up my body, see Tru up in heaven
No Limit is my life, I love my job
That's why I roll with Tru homies like Jimmy and Boz

And T R U is the tank
And me and Silkk and C-Murder, we the links
I love my brothers over bitches and some bank
And when if you need me, Im there for you blanc

When my Tru homies call me, Ill be there
When my Tru homies need me, Ill be there
When my Tru homies call me, Ill be there
I'll be around

So Im there when yall need me, y'all, anytime
Now look

For my Tru soldiers, I put nothing in front of yall
If something jump off, Im jumping in front of yall
You know what, they bet not touch none of yall
'Cause everybody gotta go even if they touch just one of yall

They say, "Silkk, you might die but that's my call"
Wrong or right, they right 'cause that's my dawgs
Thug living, living like sort of like a menace
Form with ex-cons, people on bonds waiting to get sentenced
You know what Im saying?

And I ride with this tru click
Its No Limit for life, look, aint nothing after this
And damn it feels good to be a soldier
I roll with niggas like C and P

Yall my brothers when we fuss, I let yall win
Wouldnt trade yall life for ten million so I couldnt fight over ten
Tru tattoos and tanks just Boz and V
Just two a few that's down to ride with me

I know yall want to let me see yall doing it on yall own
But if ya fall, never hesitate to call me on the phone, Ill be around

When my Tru homies call me, Ill be there
When my Tru homies need me, Ill be there
When my Tru homies call me, Ill be there
I'll be around
