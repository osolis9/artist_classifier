I-m-Not-A-Player:Big Punisher:3:1998-05-09

Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck alot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips
Until I bust a shot

It doesn't stop, I'm only beginning
I'm boning your women, while you home all alone
I'm going up in 'em

Sending them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motha' fuckin' attitude, I'm just showing you
How this rapper do

Capital Punishment, when I'm up in there
Suckin' it, bustin' it out, nice blouse
Let me unbutton it

You fuckin' wit King Papi Chulo
And knockin' culo, poppin' mooners out the socket
Tryin' to ride wit the sumo

You know my rhymes is high
Word I be thrillin' 'em bitch be tryin' to ride
But the curb be killin' 'em

Fillin' 'em with the gas
My G's premium unleaded, come get it, first work the tongue
Then let the Pun hit it

Split it in half
Watch the gatt, baby take a bath, be good, I might put away the wood
And give you the mustache

1 - I ain't a player, I just fuck alot
I'm not a player, I just fuck alot
I ain't a player, I just fuck alot
I'm not a player, I just fuck alot

I bang a stranger
In my torture chamber, feed the loca chocha pinga
While I force my finga whre my bolas lingah

I bring the pain like Method
When I flex I flip the coochie, Puerto Rican to the core
And no Boricuas eat the pussy

Excuse me for being blunt
But I been eating cunts, since pimps is pushing
Pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps

Bumpin' and grindin'
Simultaneously want it, climbing up the walls
With my balls bangin' off your hymen

I'm a diamond in the rough
Bustin' in your face, taste the sweetness of my dick
Rip your fetus out of place, yo

Bitches already know the repertoore
Step in my car, lets start the menage-a-trois
Like Escobar

By far, I'm the best at all sex positions
Forget the kissin', I'm skippin' the tongue twistin'
See, that's tradition

Repeat 1

Some chick in back of me
Bought me a daiquiri, told me meet her in back of Zachary's
Cuz she heard I was packin' meat

I bagged the freak
And hit the tele, got the phillies, lifted the belly
And put it in her mouth like Akinyele

Far from ugly
But they used to say I'm too chubby, but since the money
The honies got nuthin' but love for me

So rub my tummy and make a wish
I'll make you rich, take your kids to the flicks
Come back and fix your favorite dish

Crazy bitch
I ain't with that, I'mma hit that, split back to the shack
Where my other chick's at

Now can you dig that
I'm the Mack doin' my thing, pulling your strings
Making you feel like you in a dream

It's the king of the hip-hop quotables
Giving you multiples, just by the tone
Of my voice and the vocables

I notice you doin' your thing
With your crew, is it aight if I come down there
And sing to you

Repeat 1
