[Chorus:]
Baby,
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know
Baby what's your name
And maybe later on
We can go somewhere
Yeah-a-a

[Verse 1:]
I got a thing for them 5'1\"-5'2\" 's
Walkin' right past me in stiletteo shoes,
Hold up,
Tattos yeah I like 'em too
They got piercings I don't mind a few, no,
I need a stunna
The type when you see comin
Everybody stop-- stops
It's what they doin'
And lil' mama looks like that type
Let me slide a little closer when my time is right
And the way that your movin'
Your movin' draws me in closer into it,
I don't care, I'mma stare
Keep do whatcha doin' lil' mama
Soon as ya done I'm up on ya
I'm right here, and ain't goin no... where

[Chorus:]
Baby,
I can't keep my eyes off you
So hypnotized by the way you move
And I just wanna know

And maybe later on
We can go somewhere
Beacause lil' mama all I really wanna do is

[Verse 2:]
Hey... Hey
Tell me what I gotta do
I ain't like these other suckas runnin' game on you
I'm sure ya hear it all the time
But I don't spit lines,
I don't waste my breath shit.on all that mess
If I said it then I meant it
Not to try to get between ya
And I ain't gotta wow you,
To make you a believer
Some like to make it rain, yeah we can make it rain
Like JD once said, shit; money aint a thang\"
I ain't tryin' ta impress ya
Lil' mama you can tell what I got
An 'at don't matter, that don't matter
We can get it poppin'
Like these champaign bottles
And don't be playin' hard to get
It'll only make me try harder
Come on
