Can I request a song?
Sure
"My baby" by Lil' Romeo
You got that

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

They call me lil' P, I represent the CP3
Calliope ya heard of me, straight from New Orleans
Gotta Uncle named Silkk and a Uncle named C
I been dribbling the ball since the age of 3

I got game like Coby, dunk it like Poppa P
Once I'm in the zone ain't no stoppin' me
'Coz you can jumpa baby humma girls be jockin' me
Them Miller boyz wear No Limit gear from head to feet

It's like that whodi, you got me crazy
It's like that whodi, I want to be your lady
It's like that whodi, why won't you be my baby
It's like that whodi can't no girl fade me
Meet me at the skatin' rink

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

11 years old, makin' A's and B's
And these lil mommy's can't keep their hands off me
When you see me in the streets holla, "What's up doc?"
I gotta a bugs bunny chain wit a matchin' watch

I make you jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation, I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy, but live a big man's life
I got girls passin' up wanna be my wife

I got grown women wanna be in my life
By the time I reach 18, I'm not gon' be nothin' nice
I'm that R O M E O, and after high school
I'm goin' straight to the pros bounce, bounce

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

Soldier boy I want you to myself I don't want them girls around
Your the flyest thing up in here boy and that's why it's goin' down
I heard they call you Romeo well I'm your Juliet
You must be playin' hide and seek 'cause boy you hard to catch

Oh Romeo give me a chance
Too young I don't need a girlfriend
Walk me home from school anyway
Okay
Oh Romeo the cutest boy I know
I know, I know
So let me be your girlfriend

Why you boys make them elbows swing?

Romeo gonna do dat thang, Romeo gonna do dat thang

Why you boys make them elbows swing?

Why you boys make them elbows swing?
